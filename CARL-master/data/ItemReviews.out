1	We use church light stands performing music readings worship.I appreciate adjustable lights specific areas . The light bright enough able read even room otherwise darkness . I wish one LED heads , though - two standard x 11 pages music stand , outer edges lit directly ( though enough bleed light see , 's bright could ) . Just another 20 % output would make 5 stars , 're slightly fragile - clearly made industrial heavy duty use - standard usage , hold fine last years.We love - 7 8 church use . They 're especially wonderful 're battery operated . With cords already microphones , 's wonderful equal number extra power cords running bunch electric lights . There 's extra environmental cost using batteries versus plugging , , , lack extra cords make worth recommend anyone , also recommend manufacturer add another 20 % lumens . These great lights music stands . If need good blackout light theMighty Bright Pedalboard Light , red light works great dark stages . Because LED batteries last long time . Some Mighty Bright lights also AC adapter option one n't . I little disappointed . I could use brighter light . I forgot dim LED lights . I looking change I find something else . They job lighting music easy clip onto music stand . The switches lamps however bit . Works great . I use thing several times per week rehearsals always job . My critique would battery life ; maybe different setup ( uses 3 AAA batteries ) would provide longer life . Otherwise 's great- This clamp pair miniature lamps excellent job illuminating music , set lists notes . The manufacturer claims 12 lumens light , roughly equivalent 1 Watt bulb , lens way light make seem much brighter . Since design keeps light somewhat directional relatively discreet interfere others stage , studio three batteries last 28 hours continuous use according spec sheet , ballpark use time I getting battery I love dual heads , gooseneck foot long . The length gives lot flexibility [ pun intended ] placing lights exactly want . The goosenecks easily bend stay whatever position bend . The clamp perfect stands layer padding prevent marring surfaces . The manufacturer claims light used free standing . Frankly stretch I would recommend light designed larger base really looking . This one work beautifully clamped music stands , illumination cover pages chart . Not bright . Not flexible . Too big . . I really n't like . I wish I went different direction . My wife got I tend play guitar less ideal lighting conditions . THis neatest little light I ever seen . It takes 3 AAA batteries ( included- I find I tossing package ) . And 2 nice LEDs . The lights bright enough 40 something eyes bright introduce glare sheep music . The clip plenty strong enough even hold rolled edge music stand . Battery life far least 8 hours ( actually probably 12 hours daughter using light also ) . I love ease lights adjustable . A real needed item play darker rooms .

Even though folk strings , I put 35 year old dread sound really good.I hope last longer reviews also wipe playing minimize tarnishing.So far good Great , great sound . The sound strings different strings could get . They also teach guitar player use lighter touch playing produce beautiful sounds . Well worth . string work well give mellow sound guitar I looking .

3	The Pyle `` Battery Powered PA System With Wireless Microphone '' surprisingly well made features I would expected much expensive equipment . We run workshops , often customer 's locations , needed portable PA system could easily transported n't require lot power . Here observations : + Long Battery Life - Worked 4 hours straight , connected AC work well+ Wireless Microphone - Built system , good range , acceptable sound . Battery Inputs 2 Microphones , 1 Guitar , 1 Audio Connection - Each 's volume control+ Portable - Built retractable handles wheels makes moving around Includes 1/4 '' - A handy Includes Echo Effect - A fun adjustable effect liven voice ( kids loved playing : - ) Note : My unit shipped one fuses bag needed installed system would work.This unit worked much better expected great value performance small sized unit ! Highly Recommended ! It works versatile puts great sound power . portable feature great also . Just wanted It 's really system . The booklet even says 100 watts , I doubt really even powerful . The wireless microphone works put mouth inch . My Shure XLR wired microphones work even adapter plug . The instrument input works OK Taylor guitar , 's 100 watts loud . I guess 's OK portable guitar amp small venue without vocals . .I 'm guitar player singer works band solo duo bass player . I found one used half retail price . It microphone I already mics I n't like wireless anyway n't need one . Besides , could pass bargain long unit works.Well , great . I brought small Behringer guitar amp case I choose guitar vocals terms sound quality since unit one set tone controls . BIG surprise ; Martin sounded great PWMA-230 vocals . I n't need anything else duo gig large semi-loud bar . Volume strong , sound clear full guitar voice sounded natural could . It 's light feather ( I troubles knees use problem ) sounds great . And since I play week I left gig worry theft breakage since unit inexpensive replaceable even marketplace price . I might give 4 1/2 stars I ca n't figure get half-stars . This godsend one two person acts already enough carry . With ZT Club amp Telecaster band gigs PWMA-230 acoustic gigs I room , less carry less worry Oct. : I think others mentioned problems Pyle-Pro Audio 's customer service . I must say experience unsatisfactory . I wrote praising product asked specs power cord whether sold extra case I lost one came unit also sold cover . I wrote least three times got response far . The website help calling directly worse ; got wrong , transferred dept . never picked phone . I still love I fan Oct. fair , someone finally contact today . My questions unanswered I n't think read carefully least respond . I 'll update answers information provided . This system works okay . Try turn get bad microphone stopped working shortly I purchased item . I contacted Pyle see replacement got nothing runaround them.They could n't give price repair purchase new one , I could even buy replacement.Very frustrating ! 
4	Amazing strings , last longer feel better bends . They smoother feel nice bright sound . I ordered polyweb strings advice friends . They n't care nanowebs widely available , swore quality polywebs . By sort mixup I got nanowebs mistake . I requested return get proper item , seller offered send polywebs told keep nanowebs trouble . I n't chance test either set strings I 'm sure 'll great.It 's understanding polywebs could practically last set strings ever buy ( proper care ) .

5	I 5 watt combo amp . I looking smoother sound , got tube . It lacks brutal attack Sovtek around bright articulate response NOS RCA gray plate I tried year , I 'm really liking sound . I think tube amp ought warm musical , nice natural compression , 's I 'm getting JJ . I 'll rate item problem fixed maybe normal ? ? I Vox I put 12ax7 v1 . I significant volume/gain reduction . I know 's tube I put stock ruby back v1 volume/gain back . I n't checked yet I 'd say 40-50 % loss volume . I thinking maybe higher headroom tube ? ? It 's stamped one 's I 'm confused . Is typical JJ headroom ? I 'm digging tube far back goes Ruby . Without going extremes spending two-hundred bucks NOS tube 1957 , I recommend us individuals go cheaper route get first 's tubes well-trusted become standard selecting quality tested reliability.BTW - tube.I ca n't remember last time I JJ tube go microphonic beyond control.I played full time 27 years . I use these.Hope helps . one Hartke LH500 Bass Head sounds great ... .the stock tube sounding bit harsh one sounds bit cleared defined ... tube , I bought I re-tube Marshall JCM800 head . This tube head I played I really cant tell compare brands things rock . They good metal/hard rock lasted year , gigging practicing weekly . I recommended JJ friend uses I likely . I paired JJ things rock . I Fender '65 Reverb Reissue , I learned many guitar gurus best tubes sound amazing , difficult find . However , I bought JJ Electronics one expecting something decent tide I enough money afford higher-end tube , blew away . I surprised good tone amp made guitar sound.This well worth small amount money I paid . In fact , I think I go ahead keep using permanently 's almost dead I purchase another tube . I opted use EH different tonal characteristics , sometimes I still switch one . It 's good quality , great sounding tube . The JJ seems slightly even tone , little bit better sustain low mids , 's prefer . These tubes n't . They n't sound great ... kind flat lifeless . Also unreliable . One ( 7 ) arrived DOA another failed since . Throw bad boy anything make world difference , particularly tube replaced cheap tube .

10	EXCELLENT Guitar Stand . I use cradle Electric Guitar , works beautifully . Easy find guitar I want easy rest I 'm done . All find less traveled corner problem solved . Before Stand I used hang risk Electric guitars heavy , pain neck I lift aim hang way much effort one done playing 2 3 hours . I least 5 . I like small footprint , plus collapses flat storage transport . Holds acoustic electric . Good quality , stable , economical . I read foam padding react nitrocellulose lacquer mar instruments finish . I n't seen older stands , error side caution , I glued thin leather back lower support stands . It working fine . I bought first 10 years ago . It still like new . I looking portable fold-up stand I could take gigs searched around . Found Guardian Amazon thought $ 10 , could I go wrong ? Oops ! Wrong . The stand sturdy folds nicely , I found next impossible get Fender Jazz bass stand . The lack extended support neck means try balance guitar precisely stand pray one gets near wind n't blow . This OK lightweight acoustic n't care much , electric guitar bass , way.I ordered different one tripod base neck support . Live learn . Had one given away I gave old guitar away ... wanted one found one bought . Works well ! I Epiphone Les Paul stand hold . The holders far apart keep guitar sliding onto floor . Maybe 's decent stand acoustic fatter electric . But given Les Paul pretty popular model guitar , sold electric guitar stand . I 'm rating sold , , gets 1 star , since zero . I JUST BOUGHT A NEW GUITAR AND WILL BE ANOTHER ONE OF THESE . THE PRICE IS GREAT AND IT WORKS ! VERY HAPPY WITH THIS STAND

12	Comfortable nice fabric ! ! love ! ! = ) looks awesome white jackson ! u also adjust body = ) thin leather strap , problem could longer bass sits high strap set longest setting Great strap price . Absolutely . Light weight sturdy . I able put strap locks strap issues works great . Comfortable well . It job little low quality side . Surprisingly stiff ; surprisingly I think quality/thickness leather . I n't know I 'm slower usual folk took awhile learn adjust ; remove & # 34 ; buckle & # 34 ; strap readjust strap line ? It works I feel comfortable supporting axe . But dont let . That means break-in much quickly . My favorite strap padded way , like strap , little wider . I use Telecaster looks nice matches well color scheme guitar . I hooked Round Head Strap Locks Black Guitar away went . The strap made Canada decent quality leather ( bonded ) gold Fender logo understated , yet classy . It 's classic strap Fender . What else say ? Very beatiful good quality . Nothing bad say , 's Fender strap hard rock leather look ! Highly recommended ! Not much say plain leather strap except 's I wanted serves well Fender guitar 's strapped . Very nice quality leather . It 's little bit short taste . The guitar rested high liking . With creative engineering I able get length I needed . Very nice guitar strap . I bought ukulele works fine . Good leather believe made Canada China ! I would recommend item either guitars case Ukuleles . Good value ! Great seller fast delivery . Thanks Amazon great product ! Plain leather . Looks good Fender logo prominent . No padding , may bit problem playing long hours . I use black white Stratocaster happy . This strap works fine acoustic using leather laces tie around neck guitar . I n't like much electric guitar , I nervous would come loose , since leather & # 34 ; ' somewhat wimpy . If heavy electric guitar , I recommend buy locking guitar strap something thicker leather . It would better felt backing , least adjustable pad . This nice strap . It feels really durable . I like black side soft leather side . It feels good around shoulders 
13	= ] - Really satisfied chair . I explain cool chair . Very glad I got , definitely worth price great overall value chair really gives . I gig lot since I grey musician I need sit hour playing . This seat works great folds little fuss . The back rest support nice , . For price well constructed perfect solo musician gigs country . I use chair guitar , bass , keyboards , ukulele even cooking breakfast . Lightweight , slightly awkward , provides good back support.As right-handed player I practice , classical jazz style , guitar left knee . For position I use chair necessary use On Stage FS7850B Guitar Foot Rest . I keep thumb center guitar neck . I report I comfortable long practice sessions.As four five star review , price seem steep look get $ 85 . But 's nice design thank . I would recommend afford it.As durability ... .. shall see . I three months still fine . I use daily . Great deal price sturdily made . Easy assemble feels solid . Recommend 're tired sitting sofa putting neck bad way see music . Firstly let address & # 34 ; adjustable backrest & # 34 ; . There 's nothing adjustable backrest . The seat moves forward backward two inches actually considerable difference feels leaning back backrest backrest n't move , seat . It also adjust would think & # 34 ; adjustable & # 34 ; backrest . The backrest cushion actually hard stop top prevents . But seat adjust slightly forward back ( presumably purported backrest adjustment description repeatedly ) adjust quite range adjusting height problem . The footrest , however , welded place plan use footrest 're limited put seat height range.All aside I still giving stool high marks 's fair price , fold extra transport venues I find works well . But works know : I wanted initially play sitting without strap . I found matter I adjusted stool I comfortable guitar rested I use exclusively strap . In way however 's actually really nice I use footrest I also stand , walk around sit back . Without strap , though , playing dexterity compromised slight balancing required keep guitar smashing floor ( least mind 's eye ) .If want stool folds goes stool . You need loosen screws take seat post remove backrest . Then 're left several pieces schlep . Not difficult would tedious every though I happy way stool feels . No couch kitchen chairs . This rock solid throne wide adjustment range height workable range height backrest fixed , adjust far back moved . I referring lateral motion tilt angle . The seat nice , comfortable padding par mid range drum throne ( I , best reference comparison . ) simple fast . I issues lining seat height stemmed need perfectly align two outer two inner holes frame seat bar , getting feel tight tolerances I managed get done problems.Another thing note primarily guitarists . The foot rests going much used drummers particular , keyboardists whose feet probably busy sustain expression pedals . However . still ideal keyboardists seat comfortable backrest promotes good posture.I used drums . aware seat swivel , front bar across bottom interfere pedals snare drum stand - unless move back bit.The final note heavy somewhat clunky transport . It 's deal breaker . On contrary , reduce performance fatigue ergonomic design alone offsets inconvenience . 
14	Excellent replacement upgrade inexpensive fantastic Squire Strat series . This Bridge strength solidness original . Replace Tremelo one offered Amazon well.Key : This bridge slightly thicker/higher one replaces Squire , back plate wo n't fit back ... something mod need backplate , difference quality make worth loss . This comes bridge , saddles full size block ... 's FENDER ! I n't think true steel block . I believe 's 's Fender 's fault . The company I bought , Ant Hill Music via Amazon , honest people . I nothing respect bought two . They made 's sound fuller greater sustain . I 'm sure I 'll buy future.I add come whammy bar old squier whammy bars fit perfectly ! This cheap easy upgrade ! ! ! At 20 years old , MIM Standard strats ' hardware starting show age . Most screws bridge surface rust . For $ 40 bucks , I able replace screws , springs , bridge , neck plate . This stage one rebuild . The tone block replacement bridge twice mass original increases tonal quality 10 fold . Do n't forget bridge screws bridge replacement come . Works cheap bridge cheap Stratocaster knock-off . Needed one better bridge came , cheap , cheaply built option . replaced old bridge assembly new one really brought strat back life terms looks feel . also priced right opinion ... . It 's entire bridge assembly 's exactly I needed . In opinion worth money . You mess around swapping parts , pickups , capacitors . But biggest change I 've experienced tone block change . The Tremolo bolted right Strats even Squier . It went thin tinny , real tone monster , superb sustain . The combination mass tone block , flat steel saddles , given exact sound looking . Could n't happier . Yes , ever slightly . Does give sustain ? None I really tell . People debating whether steel , brass , pot metal block makes difference tone sustain . I think main difference actual weight mass . This giving deeper sound . The strings go bridge pieces I n't think material matters block much , . I think actual mass . People say makes big difference suffering placebo effect . Without debate , add weight guitar . I think price , worth upgrading thin old style Mexican blocks . This pot metal well , , , fine . The rest assembly well made , well , seems like stock bridge would find stock MIM strat . If thinking going GFS blocks , cheaper , fit perfectly without problems holes line etc. , common complaint indicative GFS 's crummy products general . I used bridge pieces one guitar block another . 
15	Great slap echo sound . Do buy expectation act like digital 's closer reverb . It provides echo sound similar playing room covered tile ( old engineering trick ! ) . Great old school rock roll , rockabilly , chicken pickin etc . This fatten sound dry amp . As FAB pedals , I find knob placement slightly annoying , price point ca n't really make justifiable complaint . Construction quality somewhat cheap knobs feel solid failed year . This pedal works n't depth echo I expected . I n't even come close sound quality old Dan Echo DE-1 pedal . That certainly explains difference price . You get pay . I 'm using Fender solid state amp . I tried amps sounds . If 're looking good slap echo effect , I would recommend spending money buy Dan Echo DE-1 pedal even Danelectro slap echo pedal less expensive Dan Echo , still sounds better FAB echo pedal . The FAB echo pedal works hear definite difference without . It 's good I expected . I 'm sorry I bought I n't recommend pedal . There much better ones market . Shop around . These FAB pedals cheap mostly mediocre , I bought whim use Fender tube amp works well . As reviewers stated , pedal good build quality seems hold okay long 's abused . I use echo telecaster cigar box guitar vintage found delay works well around 50 percent mix modulated make good mix reverb delay . I n't know I would gig pedal FAB pedal tendency step hard pedal live environments , serves 's purpose well cheaper alot delay echo pedals need basic effect . I seen info modding pedal control delay may future.I alot pedals I tried pedal jazz bass , EQ tinkering , I found good mix echo . I originally saw youtube video bass player using D-4 thought would good idea . Again , Danelectro makes higher end echo pedal probably better job delay , good deal $ 100 dollars cheaper Electro Harmonix Memory Boy pedal sounds cool vintage vibe old amp . I 've needed one fender amp , yes I used spend time dialing delay pedal rockabilly/blues numbers settings got messed , well , would slow show . I wish fender amp built amp n't . This pedal makes playing rockabilly fender simple fast easy . Really quick setup use . It 's delay unit , 's versatile either , , perfect ! The Danelectro FAB series pedals offer great sound without digging budget . The D-4 Slap Echo effects pedal works great gives Old Tube Amp Reverb sound would expect expensive unit . There 's fancy bells whistles good old manual adjustments lets dial sound want effort all.. This series pedals ( FAB ) hard plastic cases less expensive hardware costly units works quit well . Danelectro offers expensive units I n't think sound much better , hardware better , 's view ! ! ! . You ca n't go wrong product , Danelectro around years makes great product ... I six Danelectro effects pedals work great ... perfect playing rockabilly country case made plastic seems sturdy long dont stomp hard . 20 dollars well worth price . great product highly recomend . I 'm sure n't best echo pedal ( even top 100 ) , serves 's purpose fairly well . cheap danelectro pedals degrade tone n't something us ca n't live . 14.99 us 's worth taking risk : The pedal gave ghost ( died ) In relatively short amount time . I replaced mini modtone type delay ... . I actually like dano sound better , modtone slapback built way better . I admit , really curious good $ 15 pedal could possibly , figured would try one . I played Danelectro stuff past ( baritone guitar amp many years ago ) remembered satisfied stuff . Anyway , figured since pedal cheap , try know , pretty decent stompbox . The slap echo good enhancement effect , meaning , isnt really top ... .just gives mellow , reverb-ish echo ... quite delay , quite reverb ... kind somewhere . I since added stompbox set little something different . Not bad . I cant speak battery life though , since use adapter combo power effects . For kicks , try distortion and/or overdrive , wah ... ... .Enjoy ! Is best pedal ever ? Not even close . Does EXACTLY want simple slap-back ? Absolutely ! I almost always add little depth synth guitar sound . It give decently wet surf-ish sound fast delay , rockabilly sound . It 's super versatile 're looking little depth color $ 20 mean , COME ON ! It works , 's cheap , n't take much room pedal board ! It 1950 's slap back echo Its good price No putting It Sounding bad products probably higher price lower price products used circuits . If You want something Is reverb without slap back Behringer DR600 I use Vocal Guitar I use RV600 space verb ducking also called shimmer . I bought one pedals 3 years ago , along Danelectro pedals line , happy . The sound I get , cool . After stopped working . While I disappointed moment I ordered another one next time I online . You ca n't beat price . If stop working years use , n't looking paying $ 90 new pedal . All Danelectro pedals still working fine may fluke electronics I used death . An electrical engineer friend I took pedal apart try fix decided n't worth taking time since I could replace $ 15 . So I ordered another one . Definately get adapter . Yes , 's casing plastic quite sturdy . Just n't jump like 're trying put fire turning . Guitars effects tools musican 's trade hammer nails 's . Think getting 1 Spot adapter chain several pedals one outlet . If would rather use batteries pedals ... well ... I 'd suggest buying gross . Any effects pedal made company going eat batteries like stoner eats potato chips . Used alone effects , Danelectro Fab Slap Echo Effects Pedal sure delight auditory . good price effect looking bit echo . I amps feature due better job . 
16	Not much write , exactly 's supposed . filters pop sounds . recordings much crisp . one lowest prices pop filters amazon might well buy , honestly work despite pricing , The product exactly quite affordable.I realized double screened arrived , even better I added bonus , one screens carries small hint smell old grape candy I used buy , reminiscent 's sake , I stop putting pop filter next nose smelling recording . : needed pop filter , work well expensive ones , may even come pleasing like mine ! Buy product ! : ] The primary job device block breath would otherwise produce popping sound , allowing voice pass noticeable reduction volume high frequencies . The double cloth filter blocks pops lets voice coloration . The metal clamp mount attaches mike stand secure enough keep attached . The goose neck needs little coaxing stay put . Nice windscreen protects MXL mic prevents pops . Only thing gooseneck marginally able hold screen position requires careful positioning clamp avoid sagging . This pop filter great . It looks performs like studio filter . If 're recording vocals eliminate pops gets recorded sing .

18	Nice cables . So far I 've problems , n't put lot use yet . Also Planet Waves Custom Series cables work well less money ! I 'll see time brand lasts . I 've one 20 years , gigged extensively , I 've replace . ( later ) .I 'm really cork-sniffer : guitar tone . I think tone comes fingers , trend last several years toward high dollar guitar cables lost . I think Monster cable sounds fine . Better ? Well , better ? I n't really notice difference I use different cables . Maybe slight difference high frequencies , 's slight look guitar cables last . That 's I really care , far Monster cable trick . I use brands , - expensive cable I think worth $ 40 I spent years , return process . This maybe 10 years ago . I called Monster , gave address I pay $ 3 ship back . About 2 weeks later I new cable .

21	This well made , low noise low cost cable . Unless make lot money recordings , fine ! Did n't know expect $ 10 , proved worth cable appears well constructed works fine ( amateur use , setup/teardowns ) .It 's decent 15 feet long , locking button female end.I 'm quite happy . I use cable small home recording projects . I take cable around gigs shows , I pretty sure would n't last longer months heavy use . The sound quality fine metal connecters feel little bit flimsy . If looking something cheap job , product . Received time , standard packaging cable stopped working 45 days . Since I 30 days return time , sent email manufacturer response till today . These things terrible . One would n't fit soundboard , another would n't lock mic . Plain simple ... .if looking crap n't work ... .buy . Pay couple bucks get one brand like Audio Technica know 's going withstand test time . Mine working fairly well attachments loosening knows 's next . Everyone personal preferences time one reason another . I personal preference XLR ends really fine threaded plastic cap outside ( first slide cable ) 4 legged gripper underneath slides next cable pinches tighten plastic outer cap metal housing solder contacts causing gripper strain relief cable diameters . Unfortunately design n't used , I chose award 5 star rating value get 15 ' good quality shielded cable 2 XLR ends ( M F ) well $ 's straightforward , pin 1 tied metal grip shield connects ends , pins 2 3 run isolated ends . The end design chosen uses single set screw connector ( tiny one gets lost easy need take apart ) rubber bumper design back I n't best luck making quick changes field , however equipment temporary basis cables important starting point audio engineer 's kit used WHEN need favorite mine 6 pack 3 foot male female cables use favorite XLR ends mentioned , amazon rush : GLS Audio 3ft Patch Cable Cords - XLR Male To XLR Female Black Cables - 3 ' Balanced Snake Cord - 6 easy open end , change phase , lift ground , input someone 's oddball source signal . Having 6 hand means wo n't quibble cable costs show starts channel final pyle 's product , I basically took away 1 star using easy open re-wire XLRs gave star value product since 's 15 feet long reach mixer anything else inside booth buck foot . It 's also great someone yells `` 's short I need cable stretcher podium ! '' quickly adds 15 feet noise free movement stage snake either n't planned got working .

Go website look ... dot Com Not much say 's good cable . Good solid connections play . After consistent use , 's going strong . No complaints , 's quiet enough price right . Is Monster cable ? No , n't cost much either . I 've used lead vocal tracks studio condensor mic professional album sessions fine . well made perfect length needs . shielding great well . end connectors well made strong . I purchased connect Sennheiser mike guitar amps . This requires , course , addition 1/4 inch adapter plug . The cable worked perfectly proved durable suitable length least jamming friends playing small venues . : I marked product one star connector fell apart I regarded relatively light duty . The set screw fell could found . I 've similar problems Pyle products . If buy , I recommend tat get micro-screwdriver set well tighten te connector screws similar xperience . Like products market , depending item used , experience may vary . For , cable going used semi-stationary mic stand project studio , thus far , 's done nothing exceptional job . I tested cable different mics scenario , signal strong , pricey cables . Would I purchase ? Absolutely ! The extra length gives flexibility . Cord works well n't problem , date . directly system , mini-amp . Works well . I tell guys , XLR cables I received recently far best quality cables I ever encountered entire music ( professional ) would suggest cables one .

This eat 9v batteries also picked AC power adapter uses houses.We also like headphone jack , cuts sound speaker plugged in.Highly Recommend ! Note : We `` '' color This 10 watt walkman size guitar amplifier . The controls , Tone , overdrive . It also headphone jack . In honest opinion , good headphone amplifier use need practice without disturbing people around . The speaker sound fine clean sound ( like jazz , country ) semi distorted ( rock ) . If looking small amp . metal may . get Danelectro DA-1 AC power adapter instead batteries may go quick . Overall 's pretty good . If getting amp portable practice want hear playing care sounds great happy little amp . It sounds surprisingly good twenty bucks . I said good , loud . Loud enough , yes .

26	Using mic Mesa Boogie Mark V 1x12 cabinet . It holding Shure SM57 microphone . The microphone clip came stand plastic , I 'm using one came microphone metal threads . I purchased mic stand desk home . It job well . If 're looking desktop podcasting internet radio , , 's perfect . Many adjustments get right position . It 's definitely performance mic , feel bit , , wo n't notice flimsiness except 're adjusting . Adjusting tad tedious , , get really good position microphone couple 've mounted Samson Dynamic Cardioid USB microphone . It works well sure . Then , I attached standard pop filter , microphone started tipping . Make sure boom aligned leg extension , tip 's much weight . Just find something semi heavy find way attached existing counter-weight , excellent . So mic wo n't play nice large condensers + pop filters + shockmount start , , find good counter weight well.It looks great , definitely easy eyes room . It good investment , , definitely get pay . If 're hesitant attaching lot stuff , , I would recommend shelling couple dollars sturdier stand.But atleast , job , well . This little fellow well built mostly steel heavy size . The locking knobs job without fail I n't crank get hold . I use sitting top table holds computer , recording interface stuff I use recording . It adjust perfect vocals I drop I want use recording acoustic guitars without using pickup . Same violins . I get different sound recording mic I base heavy hold mic boom extended way . You must turn one foot direction use get full extension minute retraction , stand securely direction . I set I want swing way till I need . I used sitting floor chair reaches fine vocals acoustics . It 's accessible desk . This would work fine would recommend critical buddies . Thanks This mic stand work great mic'ing full stacks guitar people mentioned counterweight could heavier need pay attention feet relation microphone . You make sure one feet pointing exact direction microphone arm way downward force applied directly onto support leg . Just got stand today.First impressions always important , stand gave good seems made solid enough , like cheap brand base solid heavy keep stand falling telescope mechanism quite well cable clip adjustment piece smaller mic got mine set extend 3ft tall . It 's quite perfect height I 'm seated stool.One thing I quite like construction crew rod base place . It unscrews easily mic stand moved . Maybe adding something keep screwed ? Would recommend buying mic amps cabs . great stand anyone looking mic guitar amp , seems well built rugged , although mic clip cheap plastic component immediately replace ! I use fairly light mics ( seeNady Drum Mic details ) I generally mic bass drums , I stand allows way , may seem unconventional folks . I place mic batter side drum three feet back . Since problematic floor tom throne ( hi-hat ) access , boom adjustability stand great stand shines micing amps . Some small amps , theFender Champion 600 Electric Guitar usually placed raised surface keep floor . This stand reach stand chair seat height . For larger amps floor tiltback stands , mic stand still allow position mic need it.My use relatively narrow - kick drums amps . But , stand excellent opinion . With mics I using heavy enough remain stable , I need place mics , allows relative ease . Rock Solid ! Sturdy ! Everything exactly would want . I use MIC Blackstar 2x12 Cab SM57 I look many stands I brought one , rating great I 'm pleased purchase . If I need another stand I buy one hesitation . This well made table top stand . The weight stand holds mic wire place ease . I would get stand . I quite mic stands , picked use micing guitar cabinet . I love low profile design feet - 's sturdy , around better DR stands I cost twice much . It plenty weight enough reach easily reach 4 speakers 4x12 without becoming & # 34 ; tippy & # 34 ; , though would nice shipped single cable clip .

28	Every guitar I 've ever cared strap . I must 've bought 10 lifetime , I n't regret even slightest . The DiMarzio strap lock system hands best strap lock system available . The Dunlops tend release 're bumped , Schaller locks bit bulk instruments . The DiMarzio models extremely comfortable , easy install , easy use . I love straps . I installed guitars . After Dunlop lock failure , I decided change . Our band 's drummer guitarist used recommened straps I gave chance . They amazing , much comfortable one bulky , heavy leather straps strong . I worried plastic clips would n't hold , . I feel 100 % secure guitar fall . They look good well easily adjustable . My transmitter pack slid ease I ready go . A lot bands I seen road use straps.I n't rate straps 5 stars however , reasons:1- I play heavy guitars , I concerned screws came straps . For standard , lightweight guitar may fine , say Gibson , Agile Pro , I wanted security . I took slighty wider longer screw provided , covered filled install hole epoxy , drilled . It holds incredible , NOT coming sure.2- I use black , white , blue colors . They discolor easily . Through sweat , dirt , cigarette smoke , eventually start look nasty . I would suggest going black reason.3- I put confidence straps 100 % , I would n't start guitar swings . Its plastic clip , anything fail . I 've seen guys tape clips extra support 've able get away swinging guitars around , personally I choose play safe ( I lost best guitar failed straplock spin ) .All DiMarzio products incredible . If want something light comfy looks sleek keep guitar protected , I highly suggest straps . Works better straplocks doesnt fail like regular straplocks . I 'd use lightweight guitars . Using les paul kill shoulder . I always suggest strap `` kids '' spin guitars stage . This strap industry standard save guitar damage Well made product , strong looks good . I love strap , try one , wont dissapointed . Like always , Dimarzio products , simply best . 
29	This really nice product price . When fully extended , becomes little tippy , I n't fully extend legs gives wider , stable base . Otherwise , folds nice small travel . Nice product ! Good quality n't cost much . The price great . Glad I bought . Folds well . Has black finish . I enjoy using helpful wan na use hold sheet music viewable point books ! I recommend ! needed simple music stand hold music notes practicing room . trick fine . light , sort cheap , etc. , needs cost arm leg . I wouldnt recommend using concert stage performances home , practicing , fine . It basic music stand , sturdy enough hold sheet music books , wable play folding elements . You expect pay three times much similar product local music store , great value The price right I got one . Does trick beginner sheets music . Books n't well prove top heavy time , even smaller ones . Strictly practice . great music stand.Very sturdy.Very well wish came bag , could put guitar case , ill find one thanks I surprised good quality little price . It exactly I needed . From reviews I n't sure expect nice stand money . I use granddaughter uses well . It sturdy , easy fold away easy setup . The leg spread adjusted space necessary .

31	yes , white flaking biggie unless black case interior ... easy install strap locks ... use blue strat looks I 'm impressed really thought would pleather 's real leather highly recommend strap came quick The solid white leather strap I could find n't . It average quality price I n't expecting much . It looks nice mostly comfortable black Ibanez . It n't softest strap . But width makes feel better till 's & # 34 ; broken-in & # 34 ; . Good leather last long time . I similer straps lasted 30+ years . Nicely made good value seems bit stiff right single strip leather needs broken color Lake Placid blue strat well.For record , strap actually quite long - even second strap 5 ' 9 '' trim shortest setting I manage , strap long keep effectively I sitting.Update : The strap still rather stiff.I probably pick white cotton strap.Those fit well resized lot , opinion . Strap much better quality expected cost . Clean well packaged . Has adjustment length hole size per good take working get guitar need worry slipping . I still use strap lock . Nice product I suggest . felt needed white strap extra one around . This makes good spare , I would use trust stage . It thin leather n't seem like hold abusive situation . That 's opinion , may see like fear . I would fear . It 's flavors , work fine , looks great new white Gretch . I bought strap new American Deluxe Plus Stratocaster . The & # 34 ; Strat & # 34 ; Ice Blue , maple neck fretboard . With light metallic blue , natural maple neck fretboard , white strap looks great ! I 'm pleased . I question leather part since n't say kind leather I suppose thats fine , still good strap either way .

I guitars mics . awesome sound great durability reliability warranty life ! ! cant go wrong ! This Behringer XM8500 perfect.I like branded planet waves logo connectors rather plain XLR cables Which adds sense quality look gear . This goes directly Focusrite 2i2 interface I 'm planning using cable condenser microphone I yet purchase . I 've using mic cable ten years , come missing event . I looked everywhere I could think , thought I lost good . One day , I happened look ball TV cable wire rehearsal room , . I n't remember I 'd gotten , even manufacturer .

And I know anything goes wrong I return local dealer . Well worth investment ! 
34	In house alone bass player , acoustic guitar player , sax player violinist , counting ( I attempt play mandolin harmonica , usually I fail ) diverse instruments used require different tuners little one clutter tuners history , I set aside music family room mounted music stand everyone tune practice , sax player sneers us tuners still finds use reference notes metronome function built little sure buy theKorg CM-100L Clip On Contact Microphone For want tune instrument others playing . I Korg CA-30 tuner years I really like.I wanted get metronome liked idea combined unit.Initially I bought Boss money , returned response time volume good Korg TM-40 , batteries rattled around I like middle green LED tuning.The price ca n't beat 's well built item works great.I concerned power buttons sticking much , take pressure would seem , delay turns , turned issue.I real hot color , 's nicely made works well , I live it.I especially like little folding stand back , rather find old credit card . I 6 months mostly use practicing metronome . I another tuner , set EADGBE , much easy tune without confusion . Although tuner flexibility tuning differently , 's confusing keeps changing chord going left & right . However , 's bonus using tuner , I n't bring classes . For metronome , initial purpose purchase , 's great enough adjustable calibration , 13 beats , rhythms , tempos practices . I 've owned couple Tuners past , currently three.In past I would use keyboard get bottom E guitar take . These days accurate portable tuners inexpensive I keep around take least one I go guitars . I also use tune violin , works buy new clip sensor even gets cost ca n't go wrong . These used expensive , today 're small accurate portable . Got tuner/metronome replacement tuner-only model . This easy use right package . The tuner function indicates clearly whether sharp flat ( amazingly tune ) . The metronome easy use great subdivisions ( eighth notes , sixteenths , etc ) . For home ensemble use , I personally could n't ask better gadget price . Very happy ! This little box great metronome use . It loud screen easy see . The tuner function little disconcerting sometimes . It seems work ok display might fluctuate G C tuning G Bass guitar . I used set intonation new Bass well worth price I paid . I would buy another one I lost one . I really like product comes complete functions anyone needs . I miss `` '' click metronome . The rest great . 've bought cable allows connect metronome line6 amp result much much better . I quite pleased product . It 's relatively inexpensive , small light weight . It operates two AA batteries ( included ) . I use primarily banjo guitar reference easy use appears quite accurate . The LED large meter allows old eyes see easily . I ordered CM-100 clip-on tuner time ( placed separate order later ) allow tune noisy music ( jam band ) environment . You fine tune tuning calibration settings . There also 12 note sound generator built reference pitches . The metronome pretty loud small size . I hearing loss , I hear , even playing , must pretty good . The speeds . You select two modes STEP ( values , -- , etc ) FULL STEP allows change incrementally one ( 40 , 41 , 42 -- , , , etc ) . Beat tap allows change time signature beats also , triplets , quadruplets triplets quadruplets without center beats . It 1/8 '' mini earphone jack private use . It possible use metronome tuner simultaneously . I bought mine Austin Bazaar . Shipping FREE FAST . I give five stars recommend give serious consideration . This device functions wonderful metronome could little louder pleasant tone ( sounds like 1980 's video game beep ) I picky . I bought son loves . As acoustic guitar player , I think great product.I previously using Korg GA-1 , fine basic tuner . The GA-1 works like many basic guitar tuners , string shows note standard tuning ( one , two , three flats ) . But TM-40 works showing pitch 're currently playing among 12 reference pitches - making alternate tunings open tunings much simpler.Now I use TM-40 home main tuner , GA-1 rides around case . Both great products . Pros : It 's good tuner , 's good metronome , 's great combination package . The stand back makes easier see 's lying flat . The metronome excellent selections different rhythms easy program.Cons : buttons front raised top raised areas , 's easy accidentally turn unit . The tuning sound activated pocket I sitting audience band contest . Also , unlike CA-30 tuner , one higher notes strongly bass makes difficult tune low instruments noisy , quit working suddenly year . Other people I know 've tuner complained lack durability . Works well since I got . I n't change battery 6 months . The tuner perfect . It fits guitar case , mandolin case dulcimer case . Just perfect making play Fair . Always spot frequency . Nice product . This metronome bit big size really nothing like it.. It durable filled options . Very versatile product seriousdedicated musician . Tuner works -- almost little precisely ( 's pretty sensitive ) .The metronome drive crazy . It various beats nice touch , sounds horrible . Think sterile electronic add good measure . There much better sounding metronomes . I bought Korg tuner function 's I 'll use . 
35	Guitar picks . What I say ? I bought along first guitar , like I preference . But come pack 10 plenty spares lose , . Definitely good enough start gain enough experience know difference many kinds picks . I bought guitar case came variety pack ( light heavy ) Planet Waves picks . Since , I 've used nothing else.I 've found light picks , ( .50mm ) perfect . These obviously n't last long thicker picks , ( still last long time ) , suit playing style type music I play better . The picks comfortable hold designed faux style . I 'll definitely continue buy brand future . Trying new types picks different weights . I found pick responsive , flying scales Les Paul . The pick 's weight perfect . It 's durable . It preference . I bought couple cactus picks I like fact stick fingers better . These slick seem harder keep track . What say little chip celluloid ? Well , almost everyone I know plays preference guitar picks . These . I like look , important , I like feel fingers strings . They also seem make good , clean sound . I use Ibanez electric Gibson acoustic favorites seven guitars . Maybe , 's head , feel good using guitars . 
36	I skeptical buy Wuhan china ive bad experiences quality control almost said , china I received amazing nice thick little cymbal great sharp tone fast opinion Wuhan raised quite bit . If looking oriental sound , . Nicely made . Some folks expect something different , I suspect . It cymbal use like crash ride , like splash use particular sound . Highly recommend , And I bought well priced - like half I could find used ( NEW ! ) . Think sounds like trash lid ? No , n't . It sounds like crappy china 's place ( rehersal studio one ... ) . Want really good china ? Spend money . That 's works . Great practicing . Small diameter gives shrill overtone . Poor recordings ( unless 're looking ... 's always application ) . For $ 20 though , c'mon . What want ? Anyone giving less 3 stars pretentious wad . It 's $ 20 . It made remote Wuhan China 've making cymbals sorts years got one $ 20 . Or go buy K quit sniveling . I say get one ! get sizes still spent less actual professional china . . Any size Wuhan china sounds great . This little model , trashy Wuhan sound . I prefer Wuhan , , china . I local music store day noticed huge stack cymbals , examples mounted stands try . While 're rich expensive cymbals , trashy sound look China . And asking price , resist ? wow haha ! ! china ... really packs punch haha ! ! I got china blown away . band loves , crowds love , importantly loud trashy . great hardcore drummers What I say said excellent cymbal ? ... . great choice add trashy color cymbal set ( Wuhans cheap blow away big boy companies ) . One thing surprised BIG sound nice cut right thru cymbals . You beat price quality cymbal . Placed top 18 ' crash looks great ! ! ! 
37	This strap works well , looks good , comfortable wear . The choice colors durable material two strengths . Price good useful accessory . Nice basic guitar strap.. Great price last long enough . I started using padded strap doesnt hurt shoulder like regular strap . This little scratchy This strap value money . I surprised I got - I n't expect something good price ! The material shiny , blue n't look cheap strap generously wide . The ends leather one side golden EB logo . Goes well black Squier Strat . Highly recommended ! No sign wear tear . holes really tight , minimizing likelihood guitar breaking free occasionally ( never came undone months , sth say guitar straps ) This first strap . It looks good , feels pretty strong , difficult strap guitar . By difficult , I mean takes time squeeze buttons , holds tight . This makes feel safe guitar suspended three four feet ground . You ca n't beat price either ! n't cost lot work well . They inexpensive work . I purchased 5 guitars nice 
38	I Epiphone Dot I installed Bigsby V5 . I could find gig bag semi hollow body guitar settled one due price . And previous reviewer said Dot Bigsby fits . Well fits , barely . The guitar fits snugly plush lined case . I turn arm Bigsby around , facing , close case . I think case probably pushes arm little bit even position . I probably would n't store guitar case long periods cuz I 'd worry tension strings . Otherwise I like . The shell lining case perfect : hard outside , soft opened box Epiphone Dot slid right in.The thing worries hinges feel little cheap , lock cold beat bic 'm traveling around guitar much , 's problem , I would worry bit I checking , works perfectly I bought - protecting / basement dings scratches . There seems lot know comes case . One reviewer says 's made Fender . I seriously doubt wonder bases . Show proof . Someone else seems think 's made Epiphone . Sorry disappoint Epiphone n't make cases . They accept case manufacturers build case thier specifications lowest cost . I several Epiphone 335 Dots Gibson ES335 . I bought Epiphone cases . I found Gibson case identical except color lining logo outside case . I could n't see sense paying money Gibson name . My Gibson fits perfectly Epiphone case . Although cases Epiphone logo outside , made TKL . How I know 're wondering ? They TKL tag inside accessory compartment . That 's years ago . The cases get could made different company . The case heavy actually heavier guitar . Regardless actually makes case , meet Epiphone 's manufacturing standards 's got good . This case fit The 335 Dot , Casino , Sheraton Gibson ES335 . Anyone knows anything guitars knows Epiphone Joe Pass Emperor II much thicker body 335 Dot . This case intended Emperor II . It 's great case protect guitar , 's designed thrown rooftop run car . I bought two cases Harmony . One single cutaway reissue vintage double cutaway . Both guitars fit perfectly . Bought Dot . It fits snugly adequately padded . The outer material strong I feel comfortable carrying storing guitar . A must already paying much Guitar go . This Epiphone Hardshell case real bargain ! Well built functional , perfect size Dot , Casino , 335 , case Sheraton II . Finished faux leather , nice scuff resistant vinyl sort , much like old Fender . NICE hardware case . All latches fitted well good looking rock solid . . The handle n't going anywhere ! Inside get nice soft plush interior , obligatory compartment strings things , good solid rattle free fit 2 feet end standing upright , 2 well placed feet side 3 bottom . NO matter way place case ( upside ) guitar case protected . You get total FIVE good quality latches ( one locks , key included ) hinges either end . As I said , hardware case really good . For one hundred dollars case unbelievable immediately struck SOLID case feels . It lightweight either . I feel totally secure keeping transporting Sheraton II case unworried breaking apart popping open , etc . Mine came almost scuff free box , signs handled bit packing . Still , looks super overall visual presentation far price.If I could make two criticisms , would I notice stitching appears single stitched , rather double stitched . Also , strip fabric holds lid open seems overly thin well implemented . It smallish piece colored vinyl attached lid case body looks like first thing wear even break . Also , close case , instead folding tends stick back case , manually pulling case fully closing . I would much preferred nice self folding piece covered material lines case . This minor niggle could easily replaced either handy , music store halfway decent tech reason believe case fall apart anytime soon . Overall , I extremely pleased case Sheraton II happy found long term home . An excellent value , highly recommended ! great case Epiphone Sheraton II ! If dot , sheraton , 335 , buy case ! It comes key lock . As lot Epiphone owners learned , cases designed Gibson ES-335 clones wo n't fit Epiphone guitars , Epiphones slightly larger headstock . This case , however , fits Dot Custom like glove . The padding perfect , top arched precisely fit guitar , build quality better might expect price level . Did n't expect much price top notch case Epiphone - Gibson Guitars - Great Deal protect investment ! ! I got Epi Sheraton II : PROS : It fits perfectly ; 's `` fur '' lined decent sized internal compartment ; 's solid hardware sturdy ; one locking latch ( five ) , nothing would stop real thief ; two knobs bottom allow case stand end without tipping , two knobs side put side , three knobs back allow lay without completely ground ; 's relatively thin.CONS : It 's heavy ; handle positioned oddly angle ; `` Made China '' 've several cases one nicest . On personal level , I 'd prefer n't say `` Epiphone '' outside . But since 's good place hide $ 3000 Gibson 335 . When case arrived I feared small hold Epiphone Dot . But , case fits Dot like glove . The case sturdy enough protect guitar knocks dings plush inside guitar 's finish . The accessory compartment large enough hold picks , tuner , extra strings .

This particular unit one finest products I give credit price point effort . Someone appreciate . It sits drawer end sold online 's defective I want . Cheap , big loss . If want interesting echo repeat , worth minimal investment . I recommend buying multi-plug power supply goes batteries fairly quickly likely buying pedals compliment one . An old school delay works well . Simple use . Adjustments intensity length . Uses 9V power adaptor . Reasonably priced . great little pedal . Has nice set adjustments give wide range delays echo sound . Easy use , low price , classic sounds . I wish I 4 ears I could buy another one . Strictly home studio use , n't tried gigging , though seems pretty sturdy , plastic , pretty solid plastic . I also Danelectro Fab Echo blows away . The Danelectro okay , n't depth adjustment Berhinger pedal . behringer products cheap . good quality make sound . hopefully , behringer make even better next time without compromising price .

Great beginners . I use Dunlops . For number reasons . First , texture plastic gives good sound , easier hold . Second , `` grippy '' texture put makes easier hold .

It n't require great force lot hand strength use capo . The rubber parts replaceable name like shubb know 're getting good product . I recommend capo anyone . Thought buying ( expensive ) G7th capo , I 'm glad I n't . The tried true Shubb works great great price . I n't use much 's nice know I I wo n't mess around detune make sound right . The difference one style ' night day . This great capo ! I using Kyser capos good portion ten years playing limits . For one , intonation n't always right guitar ( especially electric ) would go tune frequently . After trying others , I settled Shubb Kyser every aspect . Its features surprised . It small incredibly light weight , almost ca n't tell 's . The adjustable knob great allows dial capo right pressure n't get annoying buzz . Also tone greatly improved ( awesome bonus ) making acoustic sound much clearer much defined opposed Kyser I noticed muddied sound . Even though make adjustments capo still easy use one best investments I ever made ! This capo n't quite wide enough regular steel string acoustic guitar . If I position work long I n't bump string pop one side . This capo works well ! It applies enough pressure due adjustable design . The rubber seems hold well - 's bit thin seems like could wear extended period time , I 've issues yet.My guitar stays tuned longer periods due capo 's design . I also quick-change Keyser I say I prefer one practice sessions , Keyser performing . This one slow stage . I lot research I finally found right It little bit pricey , get pay ...

49	That guitar sounds magically beautiful guitar level cost . It great pleasure jam around . Sound like 's real big brother . Very suppose , best choise kid ! All hardware Just give days tuners get used ... I 've interested learning play guitar long time , huge problem finding something affordable made smaller hands , I 'm rather petite . Luckily , found one secondhand ( needed minimal repairs ) 's great . I n't know anything purchasing new , I tell great beginner 's instrument someone small hands . I 'll also note 's even affordable 's brand new.The notes surprisingly coming guitar 's low-priced . I 'd definitely recommend guitar anyone interested learning play interested enough pay arm leg instrument . I impressed little guitar . The build quality seemed good toggle pods complaints I E string breaks often , direct result constant tuning strings.I feel tuners strong enough ratio adequate keep tune.Still great guitar 5 10 year old . The build quality could better - ideally nut needs replaced ( cut rush job ) neck needs reset ( 's gap indicates pocket n't completely cleaned put ) - expect price . It however playable instrument right box 're willing invest another $ 50 great starter guitar ( smaller ) player travel instrument . I bought replace son 's previous guitar broken hard use . From initial unboxing clear made much better standard . The wood looks beautiful . All metal parts look sturdy sounds good , although son beginner I judge guitar I happy purchase looks better made I expected . ORIGINAL : My first Mini , purchased decade ago , bad investment . The four neck bolts continually came loose , amount tweaking could get intonation right ( Note : adults probably play `` tuned- '' ... I play mine F - Bb - Eb - G # - C - F ... , large fingers , probably use capo standard tuning heavier strings ) string tension similar full-sized guitars ) , pick-up pole pieces n't align strings , finish uneven . It cost $ 99 I figured I got less I paid . It clearly toy I sold $ 25 without regret.Three four years ago I extensively played `` Hello Kitty '' Mini owned friend . It cost $ 149 , I tweaked intonation string height bit , playable instrument . I figured pretty much got paid . A decent little 3/4-sized traveler.Recently , reading Fender upped build quality oriental Squier guitars , I purchased Mini . I could n't pleased . Right box , everything instrument spot-on . The construction rock solid , neck straight , strings correctly positioned , intonation exact , finish flawless . It , two words , made . I figure I got least $ worth guitar $ 99 . How cool ? The sound current Mini `` classic Fender single-coil '' ... shimmering bell-like overtones . The pickups functional , bit thin sounding compared Seymour Duncans I full-size Strat . The six-in-line enclosed tuners hold light gauge strings without slipping . The neck perfectly finished fast . Because 's 3/4-sized guitar , first second-fret string spacing might tight adult players large fingers . But everyone else , including fortunate children , current Mini sweet ride . And present `` give away '' street value , one fantastic bargains musical ! Bravo Fender ! June , 2014 UPDATE : The mini become preferred , go-to electric . I one jazz single Lace Hot Gold middle position custom pick guard Chandler Music 's Pickguard Heaven ( see attached photo ) versatile one Lace Red , Silver , Blue pickup set . Why ? For reason John Lennon owned 3/4-sized guitar , I suppose . chords finger patterns easier hands fingers span less distance . I believe slight tonal 3/4 scale offset increased accuracy . Try I think 'll like ! I recently bought guitar young daughter based previous reviews . She 's joined jazz band school since smaller average 12 year old , needed smaller sized guitar . It packaged well took get guitar packaging . The thing I found far sort disappointed dark stain blemishes white pick guard . Trying get stains damp paper towel n't work I took special soft , damp sponge made remove stains gently rubbed spots . They came finish plastic pick guard dulled I rubbed stains . That sort . However , n't seem bother daughter nearly much blemish , fits perfectly . I tried tune using clamp-on Snark tuner . That n't work reason went Guitar Center bought electric guitar tuner plug cord guitar . That really worked well tune guitar . The tuning pegs ( gears ) stiff bit hard turn . When I change strings I adjust make easier turn . The strings guitar comes cheap I 'll need change soon much better set , 'll now.I plugged guitar old Crate amp sounded pretty good . The knobs front guitar turn well supposed . It 's easy control tone volume guitar without much amp . My daughter great time getting used . She 's great classical guitarist ( I teach classical guitar ) playing electric guitar new experience . My old Strat big heavy black one looks good ( despite I see ) awesome playing jazz guitar school concert night . Since guitar inexpensive right smaller person , I really ca n't find anything major wrong say . I 'm glad I bought , wish n't come stains . It feels solid , well-constructed , heavy . I like playing ! I 've ordered really good gig bag , new cord , Pignose amp course , bunch new electric guitar strings . She 'll find small stuff stocking Christmas ! I ca n't wait us mother daughter electric guitar duets ! ! I 've playing 30 years got one wants play guitar like . For $ 100 's OK starter guitar kid ( I guess really short people ca n't play regular Fender ) , something I 'd recommend anyone else . And kid thinks looks cool , 'll likely stick though laminated body , headstock unfinished neck decent wood . The frets OK sharp ends , I feel silly investing cash fixed . It 's light easy handle . The hardware n't bad , stable bridge ( good idea put floating trem ) , 5-way blade switch , solid jack strap anchors , smooth knobs . The pickups top notch work well enough ( decent replacement set would cost whole guitar , I 'm complaining ) . It nice red paint side , besides sharp fret ends , required truss rod bridge adjustments bring action close . The fretboard uses cheap rosewood one spot extra glue showing around fret . The nut one I got sunk lower treble side bass side , low E string farther fretboard strings . It one small pit red finish . It paperwork owner 's manual . The tuners kind . And body/neck flexes put much pressure whole thing go tune.It comes strung Fender 9 's , combined short scale makes strings loose easy press , 's good kid starting . I actually enjoy messing around pickups punkish scratchy sound . But soon gets bigger 'll ditch something better . I got guitar 9 year old son , He loves . This guitar good clear sound ( messing knobs ) . I would definatly purchase . Thank Fender really fun instrument fits size ... thanks recommended reason : ) 
50	I really liking size board . I Line6 wireless , Korg , Xotic EP booster Xotic SP compressor fit nicely . The board sturdy steel good welds nice straight angles . The case also really well good zippers stitching . I 'd buy heartbeat . Is life something ? price . basic , tube construction little wire cable guidance clean . I would buy another one prices charge , , I handy enough make I wanted . The carry bag nice , extra pocket cables things holds lot stuff . They show lot pedals I could fit , must smaller pedals ones I find perhaps magical patch cables take space . If look picture appears room 6 pedals 5 get . I Boss double pedal looper , 2 Boss pedal board fit patch cables . I board day , realizing tab narrow pedal setup I wanted create . I say though , Pedaltrain makes rock solid products . Sure , could probably fashion pedalboard , bother ? This thing great finish make pedal array look pro . I 'm tour group . I play church , every couple weeks local home ( musicians willing give time ) plus occasional 'gig ' town activity . I 've got sound effects pedals processors I like using , enough warrant buying typical pedal board holds 6 devices takes lot trunk space car . This ' easily holds four favorite devices , built extreme durability without heavy , etc . The case awesome , ... . heavy duty , ... good stuff . The board came velcro , tie wraps , power head , etc mount use devices . I running minutes , ... makes travel-and-play experiences easy , without looking 'roadie ' get help . The angle mounting surface board relative floor surface perfect . passing wiring device device also perfect . Since I first got , I 've ' already . Talk easy . You 'll glad sound effects mounted , wired , movable unit reduce setup time wear/tear wires handling . I love pedal trains lightweight , come case easy work . If pedaltrain asked opinion I would say needed raise back 1-2 & # 34 ; allow power underneath aid angle use , , pedaltrain ... nuff said ! This pedalboard solid , durable , easy pack soft case - I love especially makes pedalboard extras much easier carry gigs . There space pedalboard cables run velco glue provide keep pedals board reliable . The MINI perfect size overall I 've pleased Pedaltrain general . Let 's ' clear start : The pedal board carrying bag excellent quality . The board solid , bag well made last life-time . As people pointed though , Pedaltrain must decision locate strap D-rings someone never carried anything shoulder . The reason 5-star review D-rings . That said , n't let detract buying . I feed shoulder strap works well enough . I know kind person I - If I buy big pedal board , I 'll spend hundreds dollars fill great effects . Buy smaller board I selective pedals I buy save $ $ trying fill . Hence , purchase Pedaltrain board fit approx 5 pedals power supply . When I initially purchased , I hoping I could fit power supply board , I tried small power units Guitar Center none would fit allow board lay flush . I probably ding one star would great improvement pedaltrain would raise board 1/8 '' allow power mounted board.The unit VERY sturdy ships velcro secure pedals top . The velcro feels like 's military grade great job securing pedals . It 's light , easy carry , I grab case one hand , guitar hand , carry amp hand ( one trip car gig ) .Overall , great board . I currently looper , overdrive , distortion , echo tuner unit . I 've added photo board . I 'm glad I bought instead cheaper , plastic pedalboards . The board made welded metal 's sturdy . The velcro seems decent quality , . Even bag single downside package shoulder strap bag . As reviewers pointed , fact clips onto bag weird places basically makes worthless . My advice ) definitely buy pedal train mini b ) toss shoulder strap drawer somewhere never look again.I 'm using unit bass gear : SansAmp programmable bass driver DI , compressor , tuner..and possibly envelope filter point . What nice product . Rugged well made . The supplied velcro makes easy change pedals various gigs.I able build pedal board tuner , delay , distortion two button amp channel switcher room spare . It looks neat tidy . Using George L 's makes look even better.I buy one . These things rock ! ** EDIT - great little board I found Power Grip Pedal Board Velcro - board new velcro make unstopable unit .

You wont regret ! This update original review I fully tested two capos . I 'm truly surprised good reviews . I 'm sure 's possible . I 've already original review Jim Dunlop capos . I purchased two , I given away student players I use . I tested capos standard acoustic also electric guitar . The E string buzzes capo applied amount adjusting capo would stop buzz . Both capos problem.When I received capos , I noticed right away excellent quality actual Jim Dunlop capos . The craftsmanship visibly lower quality materials used lesser quality official Jim Dunlop capos . The rubber strong odor brand-name printed anywhere product . As professional musician , I need purchase reputable brand-name products I ca n't afford gear failing performances . I idea future performance capos apparent brand , reputation . When I contacted seller , honest . A quality , low-cost capo easy use perfect job guitar strap way use This Capo solid well made . I use seagull acoustic , Fender Stratocaster . No problems .

What great device . This first ' capo I 've owned . I used use old stretchy things . Since I play jams , 's important I change quickly accurately . Move fret fret guitar stays tune . Great capo ! I 've tried lot capos , including pretty expensive brand name capos , still unbeatable keeping right pressure strings . Although touted acoustic guitars , works well Ibanez Electric well dreadnaught acoustic/electric . The spring tough holds securely . On quick process strength operate . I rate 4 stars I received n't chance use much . But , I like far . It delivered quickly . It job . I 'll update I 've awhile . Thought I 'd try 's another brand I prefer . Needed re-shift capo lot get hold strings evenly mute . I owned capos , one simply best . I n't take lot room fret , yet springs strong hold properly long time . I 've used mine electric acoustic guitars easy use , quick reposition , frets strings properly . It cost effective looks good . Nice color option , usual black everyone else seems have.I need wider one 52mm classic guitar 's neck also flat . This capo work it.If I lost , I would definitely get another like .

It also whole lot pressure strings , ca n't good . I ordered Schubb brand capo 's much easier operate n't smash strings like pressure adjustable . The drawback Schubb ca n't clip headstock , convenience 's important lot professional musicians . I 'm keeping , I need convenience clip style I 'll use . When playing home I 'll use gentle Schubb . I always used Kyser capos ( still ) , I liked look Dunlop model . It works great looks better . I 've learning little year capo long . Though playing still n't strong , capo still . I n't use hardly I I usually end playing around quite bit . My point gets tested amount times I use . It 's simply engineered fairly heavy duty design I n't expect issue anytime soon . This well n't change guitar 's pitch . No damages guitars neck . It 's easy use Grips neck well keeps strings even strumming real hard . Feels little awkward trying put capo one hand , I guess 's . Works well acoustic guitars

First , perfectly playable right box - I tune . And stays tune nicely too.I replace strings shortly getting . There nothing wrong original strings - rust sounded fine - I wanted something softer I put Silk Steel light strings , much easier fingers nice mellow sound . I novice transitioning nylon string guitar I needed gentle strings I could get . Now guitar joy play . Problem , I get nothing done I ca n't put ! ! ! And spruce top pure eye candy mahogany back sides . And I like mother pearl Yahama inlay headstock . Very classy ! The quality build finish instrument top notch . It quality feels solid balanced spend lot guitar , would want get something like ? ? ? This nice guitar , finish construction high quality . The hardware would expect Yamaha product .

The full size dreadnought style steel string guitar . I usually like full size guitars fit lap well one perfect I reach full length neck problems . It deep tone good volume . I give 5 stars guitar recommend beginner well seasoned player . I purchased guitar year ago thing 's still kickin , planning replacing anytime soon.Once I got new strings put beauty sounded like singing angel , action fine definitely one best & # 34 ; & # 34 ; acoustic guitars . This one probably closer $ 150 guitar . The fit finish quite nice end day 's like made China guitar . From reviews I really hoping great gem $ 200 , I 'm impressed . One thing bothered guys make everything guitars jet skis - usually means 're jack trades master recently bought Johnson , Johnson , Bristol BD-16 , Jasmine S35 , Yamaha . If I 'd played Yamaha I 'd probably think pretty nice guitar , tried side-by-side I definitely say 's amazing . The Bristol blows thing water , 's $ 50 cheaper , plays sounds better . The Johnson guitars little higher action , lot highs , cheaper fit finish . The Jasmine nice I n't spent enough time playing give true review.The Yamaha definitely neat look , decent mids , n't really great high low end punch . Now , quite bit wider bottom body , , sound range overall n't great . The Bristol great highs plenty deep lows comparison . Also , fretboard felt wee bit thicker Yahama , though putting next guitars looked same.Ca n't help think reviews bit `` mind '' everybody buys hype . Maybe I got dud guitar , I doubt , 're made factory .

For speaker stands , may want 2 compartment Lack impact resistance - bag padding . It would great made one little wider able accomodate music stands.DETAILSIn one 50 '' bags , I able put : - 4 folding mic stands- 1 music stand , top piece shelf ( fit , even bag empty . ) - 2 folding guitar stands- still room I wanted put bag getting kind heavy point.In sconed 50 '' , I able put : - On Stage Stands SS7761B Speaker They fit extra room ends 50 '' There additional room add mic guitar music stands- I considering one 2 section 50 '' bag speaker stands separated , probably keep one.The bag padding - canvas zipper handles . When laying empty 50 '' long x 12 '' wide lays flat . Seems strong enough round everything tote around , But $ 20 , serves basic purpose affordability . decent , holds 2 stands maybe extra poles . bag 's shape side view rectangle -- compare stand bags 's square . Zipper seems good quality , bag NOT padded , material used thin , however water resistant coating interior bag.I think I spend $ 10 extra got on-stage padded stand bag . But going local shows n't need extra padding air travel , bag go . I purchased handling convenience reason . I useOn Stage SS7761B Tripod Speaker Stands , light duty , awkward carry . This case solves problem . When I mentioned light duty title , I truly meant . While I gig twenty times per month , nearly totally acoustic , small powered speaker rooms project grand piano . On rare occasions need full PA , case comes handy . Moving individual speaker stands vehicle performance area awkward . case hold beautifully used three four times per month full PA needed . I sure I would want heavier , metal speaker stands weight would quickly wear case . It reinforced stress points , I still feel adequate heavier stands.You easily fit two stands I mentioned Stage Stands MS7701 Tripod Boom Microphone Stand . The side pocket good like XLR 1/4 inch adapters , patch cables line : case occasional use , even lighter stands . I awarded five stars exactly I need touted anything light weight case . Just needed simple canvas bag hold speaker stands top pile PA equipment cart . Aside two speaker stands , I fit two mic stands bottom music stand . Very simple , sturdy canvas construction , thick zipper , two sturdy handles . I n't expect carry equipment around much get cart , I 'm assuming stitching sufficient . At $ 20 , bag looks like great value . These bags large . I n't realize would hold large tripod stands . My bags lot smaller sometimes tripods would stick top . It would nice two pockets two tripods would n't touch still works great . For price , 50 inch canvas bag great bag toting around couple folded 9 foot light stands etc.I Gator products pleased quality bag padding divider price paid , I still think 's excellent bargain . Excellent bag tripods stands dont need lot protection . You feel multiple microphone stands maybe three speaker tripods . Affordable easy .

55	These acoustic strings used Laguna acoustic guitar . They right weight , right amount flex . We 've tried D'Addario , brighter sound ( D'Addario Acoustic Guitar Strings Set , EXP 80/20 Lite ) , Martin , little stiff ( Martin Strings SP Phosphor Bronze 12.5-55 MSP4150 ) . In end , Elixirs sound feel best said , perfect guitar string everyone . The perfect guitar string one feels sounds right guitar . For combination , outstanding strings.On strings lasting longer , 's hard say . Fresh strings sound better . It 's clear wound strings corrode like non-coated strings . But I 'm certain last much longer . We buy sound good right amount flex - playability . Corrosion crud string n't sole factor changing strings.June 15 , 2010 Update : Elixir wonderful company . On third fourth sets Elixir strings , G string snapped son tuning guitar first time . Elixir outstanding , replace string n't perform standard.The amazing thing - I 've watched tons videos watched lot guys change strings , I 'm still confused . The Elixir website ( 's pretty simple elixirstring dot com ) outstanding . Ther two part video Taylor factory change strings . I swear follow instructions , change strings minutes . It simple reproducible . I love technique.I 'm huge fan strings ! Purchased strings tried Blue Steel strings . My son much prefers Elixir strings . They last lot longer Blue Steel strings says Elixir sound better , . I 've playing guitar twenty years I 've tried every guitar string existance even Elixir coated strings . I 've come realise benefits slightly longer life barely makes sense given much higher price pay . Eventually , strings corrode lose professional playing gigs , change strings often anyway pay much polycoating n't make sense . If kind occasionally takes axe maybe would make difference I I get least expensive ones make sure I wipe clean , even using products like string cleaners Fast Fret reduce finger squeak necessary strings last quite time well except much lower people know guitar stringmakers exist U.S. many retailed actually strings different brand names . Granted Elixir probably n't one try make time left polycoating technology thing pay much strings benefit get really substantial justify price ? I use generic Kyser stings classical acoustic guitars Memphis Electrics electric cheapest I could find web sound affected way . In fact , much likely improve upon sound using better amps guitar cables strings ; least people would able hear difference . Do n't get wrong Elixir strings bad much likely get better sound improving technique ( practice ) , getting better cables , pickups , amps , guitars etc using strings . For better string life , wipe clean strings use . This discipline habit good ! I heard friend , several years back.I teach run mobile recording studio use guitars time mobile music recording worship services.These strings allow keep ' several weeks time , even constant usage.I wipe strings use still sound bright crisp many sessions. [ ... ] There 's NO THING `` best string '' . From experimenting years , I 've found , I `` old standbys '' first thing I try , often string right particular guitar varies guitar strings become rage last years . They 're expensive , last lot longer , especially kind body chemistry causes corrode quickly . Also , minimize amount finger noise get slide strings.Elixir Polywebs first coated string . The coating much heavier strings . This produces much less bright , muted sound . I old guitar bright I ca n't stand standard strings . The Elixir Polywebs tone point 's 're looking darker sound , Elixir Polywebs definitely worth shot . If want coated string prefer brighter sound uncoated strings , definitely n't want 4 stars applies want particular type sound . If n't want sound , could end 1 star . Im huge fan Elixir 's ! ! ! This , however , first go polyweb , disappointment ! ! These best strings buy , IMHO . There hardly noise whilst fingers slide strings change chords . I tried strings I always come back Elixir . great strings , deep rich tones highs lows , good value dollar customer service second none 
56	This saved med least $ 40 instead getting traditional pre-amp . Best invention ever ! ! Also portable . Downside plastic seem fragile I keep condenser mic fragile stuff . Never really intended use professional setting noise issue big deal . Just wanted simple device could fit backpack interface laptop interviews music recordings . For price paid , 's cheap lightweight plastic construction leaves much desired . Overall , I recommend product current price 's sold . 15 20 dollars , sure . Still , 's OK product . I little concerned reader reviews , warranty , Blue 's reputation , Amazon customer service convinced give try . And general , I 'm pretty satisfied . Using one Oktava microphones I get excellent sound , hum , far , excellent reliability . I 'm using Audacity programs , none difficulty recognizing . There issues setting initially , I 'm bit leery plastic construction , I paid I think 's good value . For thinking using field recording- stick inside carrying bag , tape cable prevent stressing USB connector . You n't problems . I use Audio Technica condensor . Works great home recordings hooked garageband macbook pro rough recordings . Its super simple use dial gain . It 's bulky nice . I little doubt Blue Icicle get job done Shure SM-58 , similar `` dynamic '' microphone . But claim convert `` condenser '' mic , even one normally requires XLR connection phantom power , `` plug ' n play '' USB mic taken face value . I say I acquaintance original Audio Technica AT2020 Condenser mic intermittent marginal success tried conversion . In long run , would ahead ( terms conversion saving bucks ) purchasing AT2020 USB mic . As , Blue Icicle probably best converter market ( comparably priced cable convert condenser mics , despite may read ) . So , necessary , give try -- one . But make sure return privileges . This transfers XLR mic USB laptop . Simply plug find right drivers . My issue device would better made durable plastic . It seem like break easily . Thankfully I never move around much desk . All , works I pleased .

59	I tried another mini-amps sounds like toys . This totally different , 's real thing . Made wood , good looking powerfull sound . The thing I n't like 's hard get clean tones , Les Paul 's harder , beside , 's perfect . I tested micro amps , I bought , practice home anywhere without disturbing easy transport , 's portable take . I really like overdrive sound , tuner works really well , I dont like much clean channel breaks fast clean channel , overall great product , need good tone , portable micro amp give one try , 's great . I 've musician life , playing primarily keyboards recently studio bands , saxophone little bass guitar . I 've owned six string guitar 20+ years seen little use . I hands & # 34 ; n't designed play guitar & # 34 ; . But recently life changed little bit . I young boy 's master universe , lot less room leave musical gadgets lying , I live apartment building making lot noise tends upon.I picked Micro Crush I originally looking micro Marshall I saw pop . I knew I already liked sound Orange amps ( better Marshall given musical taste ) $ 69 seemed like much reach try small package value came tiny amp . My son 's mom thought toy & # 34 ; 's small ! & # 34 ; Yes might think plug . The idea sound loud without loud . This amp perfect that.Most time I thing turned 1 , 1 1/2 , rarely 2 beyond . I 've got simple effect chain going : EH Soul ( compressor/sustainer ) - & # 62 ; Analog delay - & # 62 ; Cheap ( pleasant ) Chinese Phaser - & # 62 ; EH Holy Grail - & # 62 ; Amp . I use & # 34 ; clean & # 34 ; sound without overdrive . It beautiful . A little Dick . Then I want little edge I turn phaser delay turn overdrive . Maybe nudge volume little I rock AC/DC licks midnight without raising complaints neighbors . And sounds ... BIG ! No actually BEING loud . For one thing ears wo n't ring . The cops wo n't come knocking serve noise complaint . remain shelves . The dogs wo n't desire rock midnight apartment building amp fits much I , man hands & # 34 ; made guitar & # 34 ; guitar callouses , couple $ $ 2k guitars one soon come home frankly love playing guitar I never life . This I set little rig next couch 's always . Always ready go . So I play I 'm watching baseball . I play I 'm watching news . I play I 'm playing Crazy 8 's son . I play morning , noon night . Not I 'm actually getting playing either . Lots playing/practice seems inevitably make better ( hint : finger exercises , work ) .So I I reiterate headline : little amp changed life ( better ) buy $ 100 I 've made since I bought son balance bike . Which orange ! This Orange Micro Crush amp lives 's name . It 's little , third size Roland Micro Cube , 's plenty loud . Surprisingly loud really , 's amazing much sound comes thing . Of course n't bells whistles Micro Cube , 's basically got clean channel , overdrive channel tuner . Then volume knob tone knob 's . The drive gives good sound I like run pedals anyway . It 's missing reverb , I would like , 's far deal issues build quality , feels solid rock . Of course 's size trademark Orange color make look like toy , 's definitely capable little amp . Definitely keeper ! I surprised sound amp produces . The build quality top notch . Tuner right , overdrive seems fine . I 'm overdrive player.Cons : far none I n't expect . 
60	Good quality one . I like big size type . Would like thinner one . So far good . These little larger traditionally sized , normally see used picks . Thus , . Having said , top quality excellent picks . I use types brands Fender 's always predictably great quality . This shape give strumming hand better grip pick . I sand bit one points give shape like classic Fender pick . The stock rounded point attack string . Good strumming rhythm , hot lead . So glad I found , three sides , much easier hold , thin ! As beginner make much comfortable . Maybe little bigger I 'm comfortable , guy friends huge hands love things . They keep disappearing . 
61	The Rat used everyone David Gilmour Dave give grasp range . It everything light crunch , thick rhythms , harmonics , near infinite sustain , mid-range push cut mix like distortion pedal.This pedal left board since day I bought . The fact 's built like tank ensures 's going around long time playing days . This distortion pedals judged . Adds thick creamy distortion , enhances harmonics , maintains great attack definition . Sounds awesome . True bypass . There hundreds distortion pedals market today . Sure , said best , RAT one . And great price boot . This pedal new . I 've past , RAT 2 great older `` vintage '' models . Goes nice bit drive far better Tube Screamer , near fuzztone , warm , smooth creamy tones . . No distortion pedal well . I 've playing 5 decades share . But RAT delivers . No joke . It , well.The Filter ( tone ) set tone gets deeper going clockwise rather counter clockwise . That might thow folks , 's little thing really . The Filter core 's tone Distortion control increases distortion . By going higher Distortion control , volume goes little . That 's great making changes playing less lean bump bit , volume wo n't go roof.100 % silent switching . No hum . No buzz . And loss increase overall level engage unit . comes mind . Easy set . Strong Tiger tank . And flat gives want without fuss 6 8 knobs mess . And three glow dark like past . Kinda cool ask me.If one wants good distortion pedal perform without issues , get RAT . If want impress friends much money dumped `` '' pedal sits RAT 's shadow , buy high dollar unit least `` Look Good '' play . But tone still stink . Its . Me ? Its brainer . I go RAT ... . I one one 80 's back home , I looking new peddle , I found still best around . I remember searching right peddle back 80 's going dozens settling Rat . And 's exactly ... Simple , sturdy settings perfect crunch blistering distorted sustain . I run manner amps - including Marshalls , Vox , even Crate , tube transistor , quick easy adjustments I get exactly I 'm looking matter 'm old school player - meaning I want sound come guitar amp instead processors . This enhancement sound , basis ... though I expect anyone get want baby . This pedal exactly I looking since three years ago I started performing . The distortion deep , long sustain , nice tone classic Boss DS-1 pedal . It 's perfect great sound , heavy rhythm guitar chugging fat , solos.I love pedal using constantly ever since I got , word fair warning : pedal uses power charge rather typical guitar pedal ( barrel jack . Look power supply Boss pedal see I talking . This ProCo RAT Pedal NOT use ) . If buy pedal , one four things:1 ) Buy power supply made specifically ) use replace ) Find converter barrel jack 3.5mm ) Be electrical engineer rewire yourself.Other , excellent pedal ! After playing digital equipment years I recently got analog ( pun intended ) starting overdrive pedal.I always heard lot RAT I wanted try out.I played Boss DS1 store thought decent distortion found trebly thin.The Rat knobs 12 oclock sounds like great rock amp . Like perfect marshall . It really tone I must add . Fat , thick , smooth saturated . It responds picking well move distortion knob higher , sounds gets animal . Very thick `` furry '' . The tone filter knob also strong influence sound . With lower settngs tone becomes trebly smooth higher settings gets closer fuzz . Very nice pedal sure . I 've owned 3 dozen dirt boxes years , I love Rat . It makes tube halfstack sing , practice amp sound like big great stand alone distortion , running clean amp . It get everything perfect bluesy grit roaring sludge ( max distortion use neck pickup LP sound EXACTLY like King ) everything inbetween.It also used boost overdriven amp better sounding territory . Case point , buddy old Peavy stack 70 's garage . Its solid state head top vertical cab two 14 '' speakers . On , use gain distortion knobs present amp get decent sound , Les Paul still sounded oddly dark . We put Rat front fiddling got perfect AC/DC style overdrive it.I think main reason I love Rat much great tone sheer , filter knob . Normal tone knobs allow focus bass treble , usually boost one , cut . The filter high end roll , darken brighten tone accordingly , DO go brighter , still bottom end . It n't bass . So even treble heavy sound , still fuller rounder tone , n't thin really excellent pedal . I 've heard claim get older one chip really get `` sound '' 's . Look guitar forums youtube plenty tests testimony showing fact new ones indeed sound old ones . A Rat Rat , whether 're coming China . Mine 2010 face still dark . So I dunno guy complaining . As far tried true distortion pedals go , really average . The filter doesnt enough impact pedal provide truly large range fuzz metal distortion . Compared distortion pedals , really fails regard . However , used fuzz pedal instead , truly shines , since really . Does distortion ? Yes . Is valuable ? Not opinion . It isnt condensed enough used strictly . Another gripe I 9 volt slot . Most pedals use universal design allows use almost power supply . Not pedal . You pretty much relegated adapter batteries , sux IMO , especially since I run pedals adapter , fun play , definitely consider sound going . If prefer play grungy 70 's era metal , work . For crisp sound , look elsewhere . IMO I love adding channels amps , exactly pedal . It helped create separate fuzz/distortion channel makes rig extra versatile . It 's built last solid rock . I love different dirt gets combined MXR Carbon Copy across board . ! I love main rig distortion , definitely helps add depth , n't tank tone . Last distortion pedal 'll ever need . Tried , n't like , returned . Just cup tone , 's . I use overdrive . 
62	First , shipping fantastic . It shipped next day came VERY well protected perfect condition . It extremely well made solid product . I think people given Les Paul rep `` Guitar '' . Trust I say , I problem leaving Les Paul Standard home taking one gig . It plays well sound ? ? INCREDIBLE . It even great acoustic sound plugged amp .

Its Gibson , IS LP ! Very happy purchase ! ! ! ! Purchased primarily Rocksmith works well . Still learning play , like feel guitar . Looks great plays great . Was packaged well . Only needed minor setup adjustments . I would recommend getting strap locks . I editing previous review little guitar taking time properly set , dial play . I edited yet someone n't appreciate `` '' guitars I . Sorry made knee jerk review ( ) right I got . But fairness I received Gibson Les Paul day , buying IT local music store professionally set , ready go . I comparing , speak . But , even comparing , really n't far apart.The Gibson best guitar I 've ever owned made previous comparison based . But little baby second review NOT ! ! ! ! ! ! I paid lot Gibson 149 bucks Epiphone . Dollar dollar little steal ! ! ! ! WOW ! ! ! I must honestly admit , edge goes Gibson , much 'd think . This little Epiphone outstanding guitar , regardless price . If I play blindfolded I would never guess one $ 149 guitar , ever ! The tone Epiphone much like Gibson Les Paul . It 's easy play , comfortable sweet sound . I either rock mellow play blues classic rock.To honest , I probably play Epiphone LOT Gibson . After , I ding one I n't broke bank . I think I 'll tend use one lot happy Epiphone Les Paul proudly play OWN . I amazed make thing money charge . I may purchase another one put away I 'm sure price wo n't stay low . PLUS , I 'll get another one different color ! ! You never many guitars.. I going pickguard one . The finish outstanding I 'd like keep way.If I thinking learning play guitar , one no-brainer ...

Sure way tune required height adjustments rule , writing reviews I product least one week ! ! ! ! ! beautiful guitar ... finish amazing ... tone clear ... ca n't afford several hundreds thousand les paul ... fun good guitar money ... 6 strings , , , e e ... know g chord lot 's fun ... volume control goes 11 , want kick notch ... ( kidding ) Epiphone LP Special II Les Paul Electric Guitar , . I written review guitar I purchased 's year I still stand positive review . I 8 guitars guitar one two favorites . My favorite Dean electric 12 string . When I hold play Epiphone Les Paul special 2 guitar feels sounds like something I could take stage n't cost associated Gibson . What 's also amazing 's still around $ 150 . It 's well worth . It stays tune high quality . Well worth money . I purchased electric/acoustic Epiphone ukelele today . I review later . If looking Les Paul guitar one . Not typical style although Amazon sell one $ 250 n't let name fool . It 's still nice guitar though . Very solid construction beautiful polished ebony finish tuners . I highly recommend guitar . Buy ! Thank . I 've playing 40 years . I currently 60 guitars . My problem LP 's feel like boat anchor around neck , I 've bought sold quite . Another problem real LP 's , get one chance drop one , see many used ones repairs . They ARE beautiful guitars comfy play . I deal used guitars , picked Epi Special along several guitars resale shop cheap . I n't mess I ready set resale . I fully expect fret level guitars , even lot higher end guitars need . I found Special frets actually well done ( Chinese version 2011 ) needed slight leveling ( would played fine without I picky ) . It n't take much get set , small truss rod adjustment , new set 10 's strings . little bit adjustment bridge , cut nut bit ... played well way I got , like stuff perfect . Got set-up plugged check electronics 's I started really become impressed guitar . Cheap pickups supposed sound muddy character , sounded pretty good , actually good , nice bright nice tight bottom end . I check sound also cranking backing track stage level playing tracks . It cut really well . I noticed test volume nice sweep n't lose highs turned . The tone knob also usable good sweep , nice . I popped back cover check , full sized pots , maybe best quality much better expected . I normally upgrade electronics personal guitars get controls operate way I like need fix 's broken . Yup , I said `` personal guitars '' I keeping one . The neck fast comfy , 's NOT boat anchor shoulder thank . The tuners lower end trapezoid type turn smoothly backlash keep guitar tune fine , ai n't broke n't fix . Please note tuning problems binding cut nut . I 've set-up hundreds guitars almost need nut work , n't matter price point . This also bolt neck . A lot players say set ( glued ) neck . I feel glue actually deadens sound bit , I prefer good solid bolt transfer sound , IMO . I found quality level low end foreign guitars become good . I know corners cut get price point budget guitars Special good go right box little tweaking . My advice go try one , taste may . There lot good value well made guitars , I found price vs quality ratio Epiphone Special really special . Get one , get set bucks ca n't , good instrument . Oh I mention good looking guitar ? Good overall pick ups terrible - Might better replacing pickups I n't willing spend extra money I got pretty fast . I took box wanted nothing give 5 stars value alone . I 'm still shaking head disbelief I got guitar price . First , ' issues I 've reading . Replace strings ! I stretched stretched things would stay tune . A set D'Addario 10 's cured straight away ( whatever prefer change ) . The tuners n't best blame , 's cheap strings . Now , technically play open chords playable box . The neck angle A string rattled matter high I set bridge . The guitar would intonate due ridiculous angle . Yes I could sent back I suspect I would gotten another like . I spend 6 hours shimming neck AND nut ( Never nut electric , even used guitar . The nut slot cut deep ) , well working leveling nearly every fret make playable . It required 3 business cards shim neck I 've ever use . After I got straight I removed bit paint neck set wood glue pocket screws . In opinion helps great deal bolt ons I bought used none would big deal . But I 'm looking horrid neck angle work I 'm steadily staring passed ' sticker . Must built Friday afternoon something. -- - NOW -- I sweet ! ! . I play Peavey Valveking 100 rocks good Strat w/ Duncans Dimarzios . The quality electronics sub par . After adjusting pickups screws match string height getting horrible wax , I 'd argue good Epi I 've ever played far pups , n't hesitate I n't really care I 'm love . ( I bought sell mainly , ? ? ? ? ) The build quality ; hmm , guitar work go . Otherwise I 'd highly recommend expensive model . The $ 299 models great right box usually . If considering guitar , I assume 're shopping electric guitar lower end , trying decide Gibson Les Paul Custom . It category guitars I rate 5 star instrument.I really could n't find anything `` wrong '' . Yes , shortcomings compared expensive Epiphone Les Pauls , two controls volume tone , rather four , also means slightly different look famous Gibson . But n't planning try fool anyone , ? players would well advised focus developing skills honing technique , rather fussing around tone controls anyway.The sound good , I found appearance finish mine fine . The pickups surprisingly good . The electronics found expensive Epiphone Les Pauls . It great surprise find strings good , although would sure nice n't cut corners inexpensive component also integral sound quality.As fit finish , reading reviews convinced lot variation , luck draw whether get one made Monday long weekend . For several reasons , I , I would buy online ( would I buy GC ) . Better inspect actual guitar 'll buying , n't shy asking bring another one n't like first one see.I discovered late local music shop would sold guitar price , would included full professional setup , including string change . You likely find similar deal live , smaller shops compete Internet , I took guitar local shop paid setup . It intonation problem , action high , others commented , strings guitar need changed immediately . I asked luthier opinion tuners , I 'd read lot people trashing tuners . mind financial incentive steer toward replacing , instead assured fairly decent , advised changing unless problem box , I little unsure purchase . However , 's fully set new strings installed , I quite pleased guitar . I n't believe find better guitar , even close , price lot shopping , considered guitars $ 500 first foray electric . I tempted go something expensive , theory couple years , I 'll want upgrade anyway . Now I 'm glad I chose one . For one thing , guitar I 'll always enjoy around . There nothing cheap toy-like . In 2-3 years , tastes may change . I may want something completely different road , I still option . Had I gone expensive model , I 'd feel locked . No good ! BOTTOM LINE : If 're shopping guitar price range , I think 'll pleased guitar . Buy locally see exact guitar 're buying , negotiate setup included , almost certainly need one . Have set right , install quality strings , 'll happy Epiphone LP Special II . I got one back like I guitars took apart see 's made ply maybe capped real , 's plywood body shocked competitive guitar market epi would go ... Otherwise decent build , basic original lp design bolt , surprisingly good electronics w/ full size pots open back 3 way toggle , good neck bad tuners ... . Note : 45 % mount tuners , meaning mount hole 8 4 o'clock position respectively ... Will fit bottom hole 2 screw junk tuners mine . So add 10 $ get 30 minute tune play here.And fill little holes nail polish like made right begin with.I like style , though 's plywood involved still good fit finish , though many disagree makes real difference electric guitar body woods , looks . Electric guitars n't resonate , 's pickups n't like idea beginners choice simple fact cheap tuning lose interest learning something ca n't hold good tuning . So bugs big player choice like epi would that.It 's likely 'll keep style revise ... hardwood body real tuners I think price point demands . Otherwise decent piece good wiring , decent pickups ... But ... Pretty sweet guitar price . Sounds like plays like Les Paul . I really like vintage sunburst color ( It 's orange picture shows ) . The strings setup nut close fret board way I like already I got . I replaced strings heavier strings personal preference . Overall , sounds looks awesome ! Would recommend anyone budget wants sound Les Paul . My LP Studio deluxe plustopFender Standard Standard playing 20 years.I Squier bullet cheap guitar I n't care I could keep next couch play rocksmith . But got old I wore frets I needed new cheap guitar rocksmith .

You literally find better guitar $ 150 Special 2 ... : passive humbuckers great sound glossy highs , deep lows , put right amount dirt tone clean distorted sound.The pickups wax dipped microphone feedback pickups high output feel like . Not sure much sustain bolt neck . I shocked.Build Quality 1 problem high E tuner . I n't notice store string peg 1/4 '' headstock . When I discovered I loosened string , whacked fret hammer popped right stayed way.Intonation required exactly way I like straight fret buzz excessive finish perfect . No nicks , blemishes , oily black flush gaps seams , professionally shimmed . good bolt typical price job , stays tune well.Back bending headstock orientation mean string trees makes tuning much stable.The bridge similar LP Studio tunamatic setup .

It sounds good enough gig box . IT 's well built , plays well , treat well give years great music . The frets medium jumbo 's little deeper fender meaning last longer needing re-fretting typical Affinity Bullet ( 2 squiers price range ) .I would say guitar suitable styles music . I blues , metal , country , pop . The pickups humbuckers means darker higher output Fender , much nice Fender bell like tones chime makes power thing I like Epiphones Gibsons volume pot close bridge . This makes VERY easy palm mute play high gain . I lay pinky knife edge hand lightly across strings right hit bridge makes nice mute Strats damn volume knob way.As experiment I took pick pole scews bottom pickup see I could get single coil sound . What happened mess wax got . The tone little brighter output little lower , still hum would n't fool anyone thinking single coil . I ended putting screws back in.I likely put LP Studio stock pickups back ( hell yeah coil tapping I come ! ) move EMG 81/85 's LP Special 2 make nice little metal favor , buy guitar even already better guitar . It 's cheap enough wo n't care bang around little , good enough enjoy playing many years . This guitar attractive looking , plays well right box . I beginner guitarist , please take review 's worth .

The volume knob well designed smooth convenient use . The tremble rhythm switch far enough way 're going accidently hit strumming . My gripe high E string gets caught top pickup I 'm playing hard , maybe I 'm novice . I say 's easy adjustable I also like . The BEWARE statement I think : 're going addicted ! I purchased sale Christmas season - I figured asking price time I could go wrong.My expectations frankly low . I heard nothing horrible things Epiphones , main complaint would stay tune . Other complaints included poor overall quality terrible playability . What I received polar opposite : I received instrument strikingly beautiful finish , one stays tune ( amazingly close perfect tune I unboxed . ) I wild strings came stock , I drummer suffer disappointment heads ship new drums . I guess guitarists expect change strings new guitar way drummers comes heads . In near future I intend restring guitar withD'Addario Chromes Flat Wound Electric Guitar Strings , Light , , , thick , make instrument . I realize flatwound strings require new set-up intonation , considering good guitar relatively little cost , new strings work box , though , action reasonably low frets appeared [ novice eyes fingers ] properly .

I could n't get setup , action high I could n't set intonation . Notes 12th fret sharp , I could n't lower saddle adjustments . I missed one vital , bridge needed lowered . Setup finished , I agree reviewers . For price , guitar far better others price range . I know grandson enjoy , least awhile . If ends dust collector , I 'm much purchase price . I 'll add back collection , upgrade electronics . The Epiphone Les Paul guitars n't particularly sound great , stay tune much better cheap squier strat get lower price . If kid serious wanting play guitar , 're completely sure stick , spend another $ 100 get used made fender strat tele . The reason 1 , decide 's something want anymore , resell price bought ( long still decent condition ) little money lost . Second , decide stick playing guitar eventually & # 34 ; better & # 34 ; high end guitar , Mexican made teles strats great back guitars stage use . I couple different high end guitars I get rid Strat sounds great still . I 'll never pick first guitar essentially . I purchased guitar much thoughtful consideration possibilities , nearly universal high marks particular make model finally persuaded go one , I regret , beauty . Initially , I little disappointed little wood grain shows finish . ( My guitar made China , may account darker . ) I thought I wanted lighter color , I look happier I I . Second , instrument light-weight , either heft playability . It solidly constructed , well put together , plays like dream . ( I lowered action I encountered fret buzz , backed adjusting screws bit ; 's basically adjustment I 've made , likely make . ) It 's barely day since guitar arrived , yet , I 've played unplugged . I ca n't wait hear sounds amped . I playing 7 years Tak Jasmine Acoustic Jay Turser Strat knockoff . I really love Les Paul sound pocket book large enough Les Paul price . I 've read everything I Epi 's finally went local Music store try one . My initial impression somewhat mixed . The sound good action seemed `` '' After playing scales couple easy chords I began get feel fro action guitar . Then I switched rear pickup front sound I looking . Classic Gibson Les Paul sound ( fairness amp setup strat ) . After playing around bit I asked try one cherry finish . They unboxed new one WOW guitar looks AMAZING ! I sat plugged played bit . I love . The action perfect ( despite heavier strings I 'm used ) . The sound humbuckers classic playability guitar tried appreciated . Tuning breeze , held well guitar I ( I always retune every session anyway ) . Epiphone really everything capture Les Paul sound economy guitar . Yes I know puriest point bolt neck , cheaper humbuckers , flat top construction , body . I point angled headstock , mahagony neck , rosewood fret board , Gibson electronics . I love simple volume tone controls ( yea little knob spinning switching pickups ) tun-o-matic bridge tail piece gon na make string changes breeze ( much better try thread thru body ) .

63	It 's solidly made stand . Simple assemble . Perfect home studio , holding 88 key midi controller keyboard . I 'm happy purchase price right . I 'm using Alesis MIDI keyboard . Folds easy I tuck away . It may work keyboard smaller 49 keys . As lower support spreads wide . Good quality . Adjustable height dept keyboard . Great stand , holds mid sized keyboard well . Not sure works basic setup fine . This works exactly intended , perfect size . Not really sure going price stands , I 'm happy I paid . No worries synth falling anything like , issue I putting together first . The picture instructions kind hard figure , different sized bars kind difficult . But probably error , even meant I unscrew screw right ones . This keyboard pretty dope . I bought back I bought Samson 49 key midi keyboard . It 's little 2 years I 've used ever since . I recommend anyone buying keyboard future currently . You ca n't go wrong stand . 
64	When I first installed tuners guitar would still go tune . Mainly second last string bottom I later learned wrong tuner string tree blame . Sometimes I n't pay attention obvious ; ) It turned 3 short tuners 3 long ones . The long ones go top 3 strings , short ones bottom 3 strings , get I incorrectly . And even worse , I using string tree part holds 2 bottom strings . The string tree ( google guitar string tree 'll see one ) actually making strings stay tune locking tuners . I know silly I paying reason use short tuners bottom guitar stay tune ! The string trees get way whammy strings go tune . Please take note that.Overall good product . I purchased Fender Squier Affinity Strat . Be aware NOT fit Squier without drilling holes . The stock tuners one peg - two . Despite , installing quite easy . They high build quality work great . I hesitant buy locking tuners first , I 'm glad I . got two sets tunners , jackson fender guitars stay way better tune , love . If never used tuners , treat ! New strings never easier install . Great upgrade Squier Telecasters ! There n't much I add good reviews already I read purchasing 91 American Tele I say I really like tuners I 'm happy I switched . High quality great design . The guitar stays tune , period . Attractive Fender F face locking knobs NOT big bulky look like I thought may I tried . Very easily installed without modification headstock guitar . If thinking might like upgrade locking tuners doubts whether 'll like go different brand ? Go get set ! If experience like mine 'll satisfied . These locking tuners perfect Strat Tele . I American Strat American Tele came fairly decent non-locking tuners . I also Carvin two Paul Reed Smith guitars came locking tuners ... certainly worth . Fenders ( least ones ) easy swap tuners ... holes already , 's need drill holes screws , everything easy . I 've swapped tuners never looked back ... question non-locking Fender tuners I ! I put dual humbucker USA Strat . The neck pre-drilled posts tuners diameter center post fit perfectly . Job took 15 minutes . Excellent build looks great . You ca n't go wrong . I 've installed EVERY Fender I . Even n't use trem often , help maintain proper tuning ( I 'm prone ) . I n't tuning slippage issues I , n't install also , money , give go ... 're solid pricier ones ... 're Fender , go wrong ? These really n't good value . If I , I would probably get Wilkinson locking tuners much less expensive lot easier install . If money object need F trademark tuners , I guess . The locking tuners great add 09 strat . They went easily , I noticed staggeered make sure taller tuners begin low E. After install I stringed played couple hours . look cool functionally course purpose keep tune . I big trem guy I use I `` '' worry tuning . I never really issue tuning stability stock tuners American Standard Strat . What interested easy string changes locking tuners really helped . But I noticed stay tune better . These easy install simple use . All need 10mm socket set . As others pointed , staggered 3 long ones 3 short ones need make sure get right way . It took couple minutes install fit like glove . I 've read people complaining additional weight headstock I n't even notice difference . They work like genuine Fender parts would expected . I ordered tuners Fender Blacktop Stratocaster ( MIM ) . I received tuning machines today ... pegs line , drop right . Remember ... E-A-D tall capstans shorter capstans ... works . I 've also put 5 springs block ( I like stiff tremelo , bridge flush surface ) replaced amplifier knobs conventional Strat knobs ( get CTS split-shaft pots replace solid shaft pots ) . The amp knobs use get way tremelo bar . BUT , back tuners ... made guitar perfect holding tuning . Much easier faster change strings.I ordered another set Strat ... great guitar could certainly use tuners . This tunners turned normal cheap Squier , perfect Squier . My guitar stays tune better PRS Epiphone . Super easy install guitar , look great make changing strings breeze . In minutes I restrung tuned guitar problems . The best replacement Fender tuners , far . I swap couple minutes , Ping model ratio stay tune perfect ! Excellent product righteous price . Helps guitar stay tune.Changed saddles time sustain much better . I set original locking tuners Strat . So I decided try Fender guitar I would n't stay tune . These fixed problem . It stays perfect tune . I replaced original Indiana guitar tuners Fender Locking Tuners , difference ! ! ! I drill holes headstock , accomplished tightening new tuners leaving indentation feet removing prior drilling . Then simple matter drill new holes mount . The locking mechanism great ! It acts like vice woodshop project . And I need put new strings lock , tune , use tremolo bar times stretch strings , retune couple times , n't go tune anymore , regardless many times I bend strings . These highly recommended anybody tired going tune . n't using locking tuners , 're wasting time restring . They faster easier . Overall , really nice convenience upgrade guitars 's expensive . Fender uses American Deluxe , I got one , I rest stratocasters . Because save time restringing , inclined restring frequently , means sound better . ( Fresh strings lot sound ! ) I 've put several guitars I , always appreciate changing strings . At aware staggered height tuners sure put correct holes ( see ) . These drop replacement tuners modern MIA MIM Fender Stratocasters Telecasters use style tuner . Fender makes relatively cheap chrome , although I wish would make affordable available gold finish . I 've seen also seen nickel black , make gold hard find rather expensive ( something like $ 120 set ) think people believe somehow give stable tuning something actually purpose . Proper use traditional non-locking tuner stable . Some folks n't actually understand properly use traditional tuners n't get stable tuning result use many wraps n't string correctly . For folks , resulting `` '' . But intended purpose speed string changes . I believe folks confuse locking tuners locking nut respect . A locking nut quite definitely makes stable tuning , 's always find Floyd Rose tremolos made dive bombing . But locking tuners really purpose.FIT AND fit , 2 little pins backside . If considering replacement , make sure get tuners right size configuration guitar n't drill back neck , tuner bores headstock , use inserts . If want use n't little alignment holes , Stewart makes small drilling jig drilling holes . It 's expensive ( $ 40 ) expensive messing neck breaking tuners tighten ill fitting mounts . It nearly impossible drill alignment pin holes correctly without jig , even jig , easy slightly . These fit newer FENDER stratocasters tele 's , american MIM drop replacement muss fuss one existing tuners look change . If squier knockoff may want measure headstock bore remove tuner look back mount . Maybe buy inspect , knowledge might return . There usually exact fit drop replacement locking tuner replace standard tuner n't , look one brand guitar . Be aware different tuners also slightly different holes bored main peg neck bores tuners ( brand ) shown warmoth site [ ... ] These holes warmoth uses custom necks fitting tuners various brands : - For tuners , two step bore , main portion 25/64 '' rest 11/32 '' .- Vintage style tuners use 11/32 '' - Gotoh Grover use two step 13/32 '' 11/32 '' - uses 25/64 '' - Planet waves uses 13/32 '' Of course , inclined , tools , n't mind potentially drilling additional holes neck , almost fit tuner want guitar . Sometimes means using inserts bushings , drilling hole tiny screw , alignment pins different locations ... best answer use tuner drop-in replacement.When installing , sure look height pegs old new tuners . These length -- staggered heights - 3 long 3 shorter . ( I think I also seen sets . ) Put long ones E-A-D string holes , shorter ones holes . These replaced stock tuners Squier Deluxe Stratocaster NOT drop fit . There two pegs tuners n't line holes stock tuners headstock required drill additional holes . I somewhat expecting thou starts taken make string changes easy I love ratio tuners . Because staggered I able ditch string trees well . 3 long , 3 short . Drop replacement MIM MIA strat . Added mass , easier tune . Good , cheap , easy upgrade . Perfect retrofit American Strat . The locking mechanism strong . No problems . I like stay brand loyal , I honestly think tuners go rest Fender collection . Tuning breeze stable . I put puppy 15 minutes less . They fit perfect American Standard Stratocaster . They work like charm . If play guitar like keep strings tune strat . This , price right , look great stratocaster . These Fender locking tuners top quality . Could n't happier purchase . You definitely n't want go cheap alternative something important tuners , set count . Nearly reviews I read positive , I concur . These nice , solid tuners , especially price.They add little noticable weight headstock , 's problem . Unfortunately , tuners require drilling fit Squier look similar two pins approximately 1/16th inch shaft I 'm going drill new holes headstock use . , holes actually touch edge existing stock holes , I 'm going fill , first.The quality locking tuners looks great ! I wish 'd show diagram specs written I could known n't fit guitar ! These Fender Locking Tuners best Stratocaster guitars , mainly tremolo system , helps lot tuning stability speeds strings change . These replace OEM tuners exactly without requiring modification headstock . They look fine . When I get guitar back together I expect work properly . Delivered time promised Quality tuners overall . I like look feel . The complaint I & # 34 ; locking & # 34 ; strings tuners loosen slightly short later . So I continually check indeed still though good price . I tuners American Strat American Tele . They seem lot smoother stock Fender tuners , honestly , I problem . These purchased whim . I n't find changing strings big bother . These save minutes . I guess 're gigging musician , would value quick string changes onstage guitar . Do n't get wrong . If want set locking tuners American Mexican Fender guitar , excellent . But I 'm sure people would enough benefit warrant replacing good functioning set regular tuners . I like , I n't love . For money great , look nice easy install .you like guitar . Now I install Burswood Strat Copy . I know I 'm gon na drill holes locating pins I may even drill tuner holes also . Look forward getting crappy , loose , un-smooth , original hardware tuners thing.July 20 , 2012 : Just installed Fender locking tuners Strat . Did n't drill tuner holes , perfect size . Placed tuners headstock lined straight edge pressed tuner firmly hole ( locking part screwed tight damage ) lightly carefully tapped small rubber mark drill points . Then small magnifying glass using punch I made center punch mark ( using pressure hand punch since wood soft ) indent tuner made . Set drill depth piece tape drill done less 15 minutes . The tuners arrived today . I shipped business address . It took longer get home work took remove stock tuners & replace . Perfect fit & look great . I trouble strings going tune often . Installed Fender locking tuners , voila ! ! ! ! ! Amazing difference ! ! ! Re-stringing much faster , tuning fast ( long loops around tuning pegs ) , holds much longer , rarely need re-tune , even lots bending vibrato . ( I love Ernie Ball Super Slinky 9-42 strings Fender stainless steel 9-42 strings also ) .My opinion every Strat benefits tuners , standard MIM 's American Strats . I several guitars I love . Nice stable , easy change strings lock tightly . Always check diameter peg holes prior installing . To note two peg placement anchors , headstock single hole tuning peg , drilling . Really nice upgrade standard tuners . I Squire tele replaced tuners . The ' holes n't match , bigger Squire originals problem set new holes tighten . The hold tunings make string changing breeze . Highly recommended . True Fender product . Easy upgrade . Fit problem , direct replacement stock tuners . Make changing strings whole lot easier . Glad I . 
65	I love picks , especially gauge . They bit thinner jazz 3s , master em , theory , play faster ; ) They good grip , nice texture . The tone gives n't bad either . Black Tortex picks silver Jazz picks 25 % smaller standard Tortex picks pronounced point . I 've using Dunlap 's Tortex picks going 10 years , recently switched heavy Jazz picks ( smaller - sharper tip ) . These picks work great . They provide enough surface area wo n't slip easily fingers . They allow high level sensory feedback fingertips get used . Any jazz soloist guitar player would likely find extremely comfortable use . I also prefer high thickness 's flex pick playing makes easy judge pressure 're putting strings . Nice picks , much brighter sounding jazz 3 nylon picks . I prefer jazz 3s since thr jazz 3s warmer sounding wear resistant . pitch bad . They wear quickly dozen last good amount time . This pick jazz picks suppose university 's jazz ensemble three tips useful makes playing difficult jazz chord easy . It feel awkward first never used jazz picks get hang 'll never go back standard picks . If like Jazz Guitar picks like Tortex picks perfect marriage . These best . Enjoy . I 've Jazz III fan since starting red ( buttery rounded sounding ) moving black ( durable bit tubby sounding ) . Eventually I tried 1.0mm Tortex pick good attack somewhat mushy sounding amp sims.But I tried .60mm holy sound change like getting new pick ups . More mids , attack , faster attack , scratchier attack , less lows . Now 'd think would make guitar sound thin , indeed sounds thinner also clearer factor two.Thus recording amp sims , get clearer dynamic sound . When using 1.0mm fundamental bit strong made mushy amp sim sound , .60mm trick . It sounds heavier , tighter , articulate . While wear faster , recording purposes 's current ultimate pick guitar n't sound clear , articulate , aggressive enough first give pack picks shot . But n't take word ... ! 
66	The picks received `` Legacy '' `` Alice '' brand . While pictured , good enough us ( , son , ) learn play guitars . The mix different thicknesses fairly even , able select one felt `` right '' us.The looks good overall happy Wow , teenage son said opened Christmas morning . He loved variety & number picks ! This terrific son loses picks house plays electric acoustic , I decided get mixed batch says great . I 've using picks eight months last forever . I lose wear . I 'll buying recommending long time . These picks come large range sizes , way thick play guitar with.There really funny smell first use gets fingers , goes away seem decent quality . The thin picks torn yet medium gauge picks dont wear quickly.These ok around house play I would recommend live performance . This great purchase . A pretty picks help son new guitar . Good thing many bag seems keep losing . Great price purchase . 
67	tremendous mic ! ! love case shockmount ... great price kick ass addition rather wimpy studio ... recording mom musical friends dig singing quality mic ! ! ! I run art tube preamp make unbelieveable hot signal without distortion clear There doubt mind impressed quality microphone offer home studio voice-over applications . It well minimizing air pressure impact room presents voice great clarity bassy tone . NOTE : use good preamp external EQ I 've broadcasting 3 years professionally I say , researching condenser microphones several months , countless reviews spec research I honestly say , mic compares indeed exceeds many microphones costing hundreds dollars 's another interesting fact . I thought & # 34 ; King Media & # 34 ; , would used gold plated 10 thousand dollar anniversary rig ... well I found uses 990 well . So , think , perfect amateur , perfect professional ... 100 dollars ? Incredible ! You WO N'T disappointed buy . I 'll keep short simple , I alot radio work , saw price mic eBay ( I wanted use ) got . 60 bucks something I 'd easily paid 100+ , included shockmount , 's total steal . This obviously wo n't match top quality condensers , speech atleast , I find wonderful crisp tone warm sound compliment voice . It smooth radio sound hear stations like NPR , I love . It sounds fantastic proper interface , possibly best condenser I 've tested 's 150 bucks . one best mics price range . It sounds incredible , price 's unbeatable . I use three mics , main vocal , drum overhead , acoustic guitar mic ( although I use two mics guitar ) . My mic 's SM57 , incredible crazy expensive , Audio-Technica mic . I love mic would replace ever breaks . Again microphones made studio I use live , good PA System work great . Great microphone want really sound like real singer , top top . Thank Amazon . $ 49 $ 199 microphone Amazon ? May best mic home studios , one marks spot . Get 're budget . I love product . It came fast , included extra shockmount line , shockmount , adapter , mic , instructions , durable protective case easy transporting . The sound quality great Art Tube Preamp ( use mic cables , 1/4 '' cables Phantom Power ) , I could n't happier . It even looks impressive . Although , I say online product looks silver shiny , reality `` '' color . Almost gold , quite . It 's bad anything , different . And frankly , thing could purple I long produces great sound , 's matters . Great product , extremely affordable . No complaints . The MXL 990 sounds every bit good expensive mikes I used . Just like condenser mike 's good idea invest decent pop filter n't want annoying popping P 's recordings . I would recommend mike anyone vocals miking acoustic guitars recording studio portastudio . Also great mike voiceovers . It took figure mic . But right equipment turned nice addition recording studio . I two perfect home studio vocals , step dynamic mics long run one pre ( I use Tube Mic Pre . No matter pre get make sure supply phantom power mic needs it.Also , model XLR . Even get XLR TRS adapter able provide phantom power arrangement , make sure mixer spare XLR input mic , provide phantom power skip recommendation get pre things need know consider first condenser mic : use included shock mount mic picks handling noise . touching show ambient noise mix . A pop filter mic optimal live performances 's delicate lend excess handling . It perfect controlled , stationary environments like home studios . Another reason pick lot nearby stage noise placed spot'.I mentioned perfect vocals . However , best solution micing instruments amps , especially lower registers . One main reasons low end frequency response starts 30Hz . You would better mic goes 20Hz instruments line : great entry level condenser mic , especially folks budget . As long understand limitations operating characteristics pleased . I mine almost four years held still sound great vocals . [ review updated time spent mic ] Well , 's definitely detail missing mids , generally pleasing `` fat '' ( aka muddy ) tone . Makes fair snare drum mic . Needs bit EQ almost practical application . I n't think I 'd use track vocals anything , works . You 'd better similarly-priced small-diaphragm condenser windscreen . man ya 'll yall better quick get mic yo cuz 's good stuff man . like spittin siK like going paint like weezy ya feel yo let 's go . 
68	There ton phaser options - even MXR - makes issue bit confusing . I 'd owned Phase 90 back 80s wanted another one . A years ago I n't budget consider expensive MXR versions , I got one.I think sounds fine . I gigged years without issue . Yes , 's slight volume bump , I think really mostly midrange hump alter tone give distortion , depending amp set . I always use clean tone , I 'm used 's big I shop phaser today I 'd consider MXR models , well versions manufacturers offer mix knob . A phaser specific sound , I love small . For needs one works . Absolutely Obligatory fan rock n roll jamming tastes jazz influenced rock -- 1970 's influences . I would probably buy Phase 100 today though , 4 different positions choose , I assume including original set-up one them.Well , I need correct . This review OLD models . The NEW models FAR high midrange components longer easily modified . I thought I replacing old model NEW one , alas NEW worthy place effects chain ! I probably get EH Small stone , though pedal looks like may changed lately . Sadly appears boutiques bought non-musical business men care ONLY bottom line NOT enough , AT ALL sound/quality products . The become , socialists think worthy tell everyone else live . God help us ! This great effect . Awesome engineering Jim Dunlop 's MXR products always presented . The true bypass feature high-end quality materials make reliable dependable . sensitive delivers . No need EVH red logo version ( unless 're super fan something ) - I actually believe unit exceed expectations . Ships fast . Highly recommended . I returned I wanted script version instead . Very different sound . Watch YouTube compare models . This pedal seems older well . This great pedal price . No 's amazing phase pedal , 's still quality . I know many pedal still board . If n't use lot phaser need song 2 . Buy . Simple clicking old Van Halen solos like & # 34 ; You Really Got & # 34 ; Plus , get swooshing bright sound ca n't get Flange Chorus backing playing old $ 65 bucks expensive true analog phaser n't available amp & # 34 ; You know man working hard ... 's worth ! & # 34 ; I several MXR pedals . Every one superb -- except PHASE 90 ( '' script '' version reviewed ) . This PHASE 90 worthless anyone wants use playing clean , adds tsunami irritating distortion , swoosh sonic dirt . I research discovered people also hate pedal 's distortion suggest modifications . ( Look `` MXR Phase 90 , '' `` 's '' show . ) I made `` , '' `` , '' `` '' modifications . The result : slightly improved phaser , one still plenty distortion . Finally , I tried adjusting internal trim pot . On setting could I get rid ... guessed : distortion . I spent literally hours futile frustrating effort make pedal sound merely acceptable . No luck . BOTTOM LINE : IF YOU WANT A THAT DOES N'T DISTORTION , AVOID THIS OF THE PHASE 90 . The MXR Phase 90 classic stompbox popularized Eddie Van Halen . At present , I MXR Phase 90 , Boss PH-3 Phase Shifter , Line 6 MM4 ( phaser patches ) , I compare three units.The Phase 90 single `` Speed '' control sets rate phase , simple use . If single knob , good indicator manufacturer feels pretty good sound unit . In case , I MXR Phase 90 far cheapest three units . In opinion , also gives best sound within capabilities , actually seems boost volume slightly . The Boss PH-3 gets slight volume drop workable , Line 6 MM4 volume drop hard use guitar pedalboard I usually n't leave modulations entire song , turn on/off different sections ( unless chorus ) three , Phase 90 least versatility . You Phase 90 sound units ( Line 6 MM4 slightly better job ) PH-3 MM4 sonic possibilities . Also , Boss PH-3 give lot spacey extremes Phase 90 stays `` normal '' range . But , three MXR Phase 90 sounds best three Line : ( 1 ) A classic pedal great price ( 2 ) Great sound & slight volume boost ( 3 ) Simple use ( 4 ) Limited sonic possibility , `` safe '' `` normal '' guitar sounds ( crazy extremes ) ( 5 ) Beautiful bright orange color , ca n't miss ( 6 ) Compact size eat pedalboard space 
69	I 've owned every muff . No Triangle . But favorite muff thus far . Way versatile muff . The switches circuit really n't elaborate , n't . I love wicker tone . like . I hate bunch fuzz 's distortions chain , right next Keeley Fuzz Head , Fuzz , TS-9 modded 808 w/ Brown I modded . I love Muff ! I ca n't wait see next . Plus ... These new EHX pedals build tough nails full true bypass . If like muffs , 'll really like one . If n't like muffs , 'll probably like wicker feature , makes far clear pronounced less glob fuzz friendly . I give four stars , five meant meant devices freak half , Keeley Fuzz Head five , I love thing . This pedal awesome . I use pedals , 's pretty much perfect . I get 4 completely different sounds . It 's also true-bypass , effect tone . It 's much smaller big muff , good takes less room pedalboard . Just let know , NOT overdrive distortion pedal . It fuzz pedal . So n't buy expecting overdrive . Also , 's turned hear hum , web says lights , muff pedals hum alot . None makes dislike pedal . It 's one fuzz pedals ever . I use front wah , 's I 'll ever need use . Get pedal ! ! ! ! ! ! ! As disclaimer , I Big Muff connoisseur . I 've never owned one . I also tend like fuzz effect . I 'd characterize box cross distortion fuzz , maintaining enough definition chord work . If 're reading reviews , 've probably already done research features , I 'll cover simple controls , Volume - Tone - Sustain , Sustain control less Gain control . The enclosure smaller , size . The pedal incorporates two ( supposedly ) popular Big Muff mods switches , Tone Wicker . When Tone switched , Tone control tone-shaping circuitry completely disconnected . In mode , distortion applies entire tonal spectrum evenly , also produces significant volume boost . The Tone knob Wicker switched , removes three high-frequency rolloff filters added original Big Muff circuit smooth sound . makes sound bit raspier rougher , high-end frequency use pedal running mild overdrive , Catalinbread Dirty Little Secret , `` conditions '' signal . I play Tone Wicker , even Volume Sustain controls set fairly low , combination results wonderfully thick , massive distorted tone still pretty smooth.If 're looking get Big Muff , 're snob version , switchable mods one really great experimenting find sound . Not mention , price point , much cheaper vintage Muffs . Highly recommended . My Big muff PI Wicker noise , I mean unusable . I noticed would change movement I pulled back immediately found paint grounding spring circuit board meets inside housing . After aggressively scraping paint , pedal operates I would expect to.I really like tone aggressive drive big muff Tone wicker switches nice although I find Wicker opened up/ON noise level gets marginally high ; long 're playing hard loud 's really issue . This pedal n't designed quiet 're playing n't fooled , normal make noise 's guitar . The bypass hand seems clean 'll keeping pedal like lack proudly made America fuzz pedal bit let ; fortunately I found problem fixed avoid return . First things first , fuzz pedal ( heavy side ) mean provides thick ground shaking distortion sustain . This different normal distortion noise expected whether playing , true bypass switch ( like Big Muff ) mechanical switch opposed Boss type pedals color sound even . Mechanical switches make noise louder durable actual sound amazing . This pedal tone versatility lot options pedal reacts dynamically knobs guitar . Since I play Les Paul 57 classics I often turn volume 8 using otherwise bass overwhelming ( awesome ) . Strat Tele players probably wont issue single coils . In addition Wicker Tone features sounds original Big Muff turn get original sound.Great : Black Keys ( use big muff ) , ( think My Name ) , certain songs , basically anything need thick deep fuzz option tone need . 
70	I finally discovered & # 34 ; perfect set & # 34 ; moving target . As arthritis I find playing heavier strings lower action , work respect . Another advantage usiung set treble side without making bass side . ( Telecaster , anyone ? ) I 'm metal player means sometimes I get urge . If gon na play metal need bigger strings . So I got awesome . They big small . Very happy strings . If want GREAT strings get fender strings . They best . But metal ( big strings ) I stick ernie ball . I use earnie ball strings backup strings . They n't nice clear tone d'addario curt mangan strings , life , however cheaper really easy bend . Since I ca n't afford restring pricey strings every single time , I go I 'm practicing . They break alot I play crazy solos , blows , main reason I 'm giving . ( No 's technique , I 've never broken string brand strings I 've tried . ) When I 'm studio recording , I prefer , like I said , D'addario curt mangan strings , however save money , I practice strings I think 's bad method , I go strings like doritos ( I eat doritos alot ) . I read review saying bridge floating & strings hard tune aswell e string popping . I exact experience bought two sets since know uncoated strings dont last long . get play em strings ( except A & E ) popped sets within two weeks knew due bridge made use whammy bar ( came btw ) & tension put tuning pegs really got upset strings damaged tuning pegs harder turn ( use pliers sometimes ) strings sound great & get better guitar might get often im staying w/ medium gauge elixirs . I chose strings based reviews I read website . I definitely disappointed . This string sound great solid body electric hollow body . I Dot Studio resonance great rockabilly . My son loves metal . We continue use Beefy Slinky strings ! This n't review strings much warning caveat playing guitars floating bridges ( usually whammy bar ) using heavier strings wanted little fuller sound 10-46 slinky strings ( aka regular slinky ) idea driving base appealed ordered beefy 's . I strung hard time tuning guitar . Every time I got higher strings tune , lowers would go much half note . It took awhile realize floating bridge coming body I tightened strings . So I pulled back plate strat set tighten tensions screws . I made 5 adjustments time retuning guitar check progress . The final time I tightened , high E string broke . Since beefy 's , day done strings . However , given far I tightened tension screws , I think I would purchase additional tension spring ( expensive difficult install ) get bridge flush I said , n't knock strings . I never really got chance play . Just heads anyone moving heavier strings . It quite shock first time see bridge sticking 45 degree angle guitar n't careful , damage guitar . I particular sound I could n't find lighter strings . This set perfect I able re-create sound looking . I would n't recommend tuning strings E however , intense amount tension takes tune E cause permanent damage neck even truss rod fix . The highest I feel comfortable tuning E flat . If anything Drop C sharp , strings work great . much string beginner fingers seemed real brand decent price.i would reorder 9 's maybe even 10 's next time 
71	These balanced patch cables great . This third set various music cables I 've purchased brand great quality price . Love XLR microphone cables . Ok , 6 TRS patch cables , 6 ' long $ 30.00 ?

73	This proven classic . Using mic Mesa Boogie Mark V 1x12 cabinet . Sounds fantastic solidly built . This # 1 mic get , recording live , instruments voice , always come great sound seems almost forward work future projects , ca n't believe took long get one Although mic considered primarily instrument mic , always case I 've actually preferred basic design live vocal use since 1970 I bought first one known `` Shure Model III . '' That mic got stolen 2 years ago , remarkably still working time got boosted I still using I needed one on/off switch function . I 've owned used countless modern day SM-58 's SM-57 's along dozens mics years manufacturers . I fairly deep baritone bass type voice I n't need get closer 7 8 inches SM-57 . To SM-57 sounds similar $ Shure SM-7 studio vocal mic put windscreen get 2 inches away . I 'd use SM-7 studio environment though slightly fragile four times expensive . By design SM-58 's require get much closer mic get full range sound SM-57 's . I prefer SM-57 's SM-58 's vocal use sound crisper highs sound fuller low end . The SM-57 sounds natural vocals never sounds muddy muffled . The SM-57 one pronounced proximity effects mic I 've ever used . If tend shove mic throat may benefit less dramatic proximity effect SM-58 . If ever going use SM-57 vocals I 'd recommend buying Shure windscreen . That genuine Shure windscreen fits precisely locks securely onto SM-57 . The SM-57 pop like mad without one . The possible drawback SM57 vocal mic model available on/off switch days . I ca n't find modern SM-57 switch anywhere . However , 've ever tried using mic forgot switch position probably became liability . For money , SM-57 best around microphone past two generations stage use recording purposes . For studio vocals I 'd use SM-7 , really n't sound much different SM-57 built-in variable EQ SM-7 set way I like . The SM-57 's predecessors best around microphone since 1970 certainly durable . You go wrong unless get close windscreen . Good around mike . If looking solid mike start studio , I recommend one . Best used guitar mid range instrument recording bad vocals . Best mike price purpose . Seriously ? The Shure SM57 sets standard , instrument microphones kidding . They work great guitar ( REAL acoustic guitar sound , drums , congas , tablas ... You name it.. 's instrument SM57 hear 's good vocals well . When gives speech , SM57 there.In experience vocalist better average pipes use SM57 . The SM58 better suited lack vocal projection ( wannabe 's ) .For instrument sound reinforcement ... ... best . If 's good enough track Tom Petty 's vox albums , good enough rest us . Sounds great amps perc . Dropped one 12 story building years back lot barley dented housing still works 100 % . My drummer still uses kit I never told haha ( hope n't read review ! ) It 's shame new mics coming ( wireless stuff make : IE , PG seies , digital series etc ) flimsy pieces garbage . This last cool Shure . There 's reason every mic cabinet least one ( n't , ) . This great purpose dynamic mic , I use instruments , vocals , even field recording sometimes . The SM58 frequency response supposed tailored towards vocals , n't mean 57 ca n't handle voice . They 're pretty much mic far I 'm concerned , average amateur recording engineer home studio practitioner I think 'll find thing . And 're operating level refuse use , probably already know 're looking . I 'll getting 58 add personal cabinet soon , 're like wanted spend nice condenser filling dynamic mics , ca n't go wrong . I use mic snare drums sometimes guitar cabinets . It works well mics durable . I used studio nothing else available worked fine . As long I run sound living I keep mics . Considering SM57 introduced world 1967 , year Shure SM58LC Shure SM58 Vocal Microphone , I guess 58 gets Batman status , relegating 57 Robin . But 's really fair assessment considering 57 58 developed time , except 58 's acoustic foam lined cage pop screen , two mics identical SM ( Studio Microphone ) 57 designed begin 's life recording studio , dynamic microphone used mic ever increasing volume rock roll amplifiers , drum kits , etc . In capacity , use pop screen 's cousin SM58 , still one sold vocal mics world day . So SM57 slimmed even though 's still fine vocal mic , 'll see used mostly mic'ing instruments , excels 's long time important roles official podium mic White House . A pair SM57 's always seen various White House podiums press even VIP bundled SM57 VIP Dual Microphone buy exact type use.The SM57 extremely rugged mic , built tough standards take lots road abuse . That 's one things makes popular touring bands sound companies . And top , 's great sounding mic price.There Performer Beta Microphonethat looks similar SM57 Beta 57 different mic capsule transformer sounds different . So make sure try line Shure SM57 one tough road mic sounds awesome overly priced . A best value sound companies , home studio recordists touring musicians . I use recording guitars well live vocals . I 've knocked microphone around decent amount , plenty rugged . I could n't happier . This mic well made ( heavy ) . However , I yet try multi-track studio . 
74	I love cables . I ordered two year change ago main cables bass guitar rigs . They still perfect get used many hours day I prefer woven cables looks . They nice stage presence . Hosa reliable brand cables . I n't move around stage 18 feet gives enough length connect mixer . This cable little stiffer I 's OK I 'm sure wear well move around stage . nice cable , could little heavier . I managed pull wires apart straight plug , probably stepped cord I playing guitar standing . I take apart resolder really good since . cable awesome thick cord really high quality jacks highly recommend better plastic coated cable I n't problems tangling like I saw one review Bought years ago . It nice long cable I bought figuring 'd durable n't last . Maybe cable built gig ... If I better wiring I 'm sure 's n't last long I 'd hoped . I needed Jazzmaster front face input . Sounds fine , although guitar notably & # 34 ; & # 34 ; single coils , I n't feel cable added noise line . Looks cool sounds good great price , I actually bought 2 ! ! ! I really like , It great , quality cord durable I think would long time I would need another one . The length long enough need cable obviously around . I 've using HOSA cables quite years find professional quality dependable without overpriced . I particularly like right angle plug . It works well guitars except Strats Strat style guitars . That 's still problem I simply put right angle plug amp straight plug guitar . This cable far flexible plastic coated cables . I 'm pleased recommend . Cable crackles plug jack moved . GLS brand purchased time works flawlessly comparison . Both tweed jackets however Hosa cable uncoil easily GLS cable . I would recommend GLS product Hosa product . I like , got fast right length home personal use . Thanks getting fast , I recommend going vendor I received works great . I 've used Hosa years , never let . All cords quit quality produces . I never Hosa go bad . looks really cool sounds great . buzz unwanted noise cables , velcro strap makes easy store done . like lot . I like tweed jacket cables hard get tangled easier identify bunch standard black cables everywhere . I use right angle side go effects pedal board side go guitar . The right angle nice 's low profile fits perfectly board , even I put 's travel case . Everything seems well built working months without problem . It n't twist like standard black cable , twist bit time . Love angle connection guitar side n't stick right . If really want avoid on-stage kinks , MUST go wireless , ONLY way avoids twisted cables - matter type buy . This cable sends sounds amp perfectly without distortion . It 's worth spending Jackson , IMO . cable hisses , crackles pops right package . save money buy better cable . buy cables locally easily return defective . would definitely buy product recommend anyone else .

77	I bought Mini Tone Master practice amp Dean EVO electric guitar , love -- things know possible purchase:1 . When say `` mini , '' mean . It 's tiny little thing size book ( smaller ) , thick ( 2 '' thick ) .2 . It also runs 9V battery , though adapter , 's plug . also 1/4 jack standard headphones earbuds well.3 . It 's LOUD . Even low volume tones fill room . This major plus tiny , inexpensive amp great ; knob almost good overdrive gain effects pedal hooked full-size amp . It 's strong enough 're playing small gigs wall small bars , wo n't need lug along 10W ( larger ) amp , though may depend tone guitar puts begin . Still , awesome deal ; I paid $ 30 Amazon , need practice amp n't want spend ton cash , snatch one little bad boys . You wo n't sorry . I expected come DC adapter . Nowhere mentioned would n't I could ordered one . The product good , surprisingly loud . The bass much body battery cover sort rattles ( battery popped I played low E ) 's issue . I used 9V battery far noticed continuous noise high gain . I hope n't happen adapter . It 's nice little amp , good carrying around . If long fingers , sort hold thumb middle finger along 's height - 's small ! A guitar strap , backpack 5ft cable could easily walk around house playing . The distortion gives good . Not good palm muting . This nice practising Randy Rhoads , The Doors rock many effects used.Also remember DC adapter polarity outer ring + inner - . Many adapters come reverse polarity make sure check plugging one . It 's easy change polarity , open box adapter exchange ( needs soldering , ) red black wire places ! I like sound amp . As said reviews want clean sound n't loudest world , loud enough practice . If want little distortion , turn gain plenty volume . I 'm using cheapo guitar sixties , ( ) , I believe produces best sound I ever gotten . soi f want turn , u .dig ? always ... like hard rock wayu need tiny gig thingie Sounds ok , loud good quality high volume , plug good headphones , AWESOME ! Great gain , tone , high volume , sounds awesome , perfect use headphone amplifier play effect . Great sound , awesome deal . ! : D I small apartment small populated apartment complex - space noise issue . As beginning guitarist , I contemplated small amp decided Mini Tone Master ( apartment , smaller better ) . Also , I need ample volume variety controls level I ... I wanted something no-frills small , compact enough quality sound help I practice . The Mini Tone Master delivers well.I pretty surprised range sounds little guy produce ( distortion grungy softer bluesy tone ) . It come power adapter already apartments works well battery . Battery life also pretty good . I 've battery several months already , playing several times week sometimes leaving accidentally day two signs battery drain little frustrating sometimes , another reviewer mentioned , remove distortion enough fiddling , I found setting acceptable I n't need volume , little guy loud ! No weakness there.I also plugged acoustic-electric classical guitar mini tone master also worked surprisingly well . Overall dimensions 6 3/4 '' x 6 1/2 '' x 2 1/4 '' . Very nice travel size . Sound would expect . It basically toy . If use 2 ( 10 max ) gain , sounds awful . I turn guitar volume max adjust volume amp desired level . Tone works nicely filter output frequencies . I using Fender Starcaster I travel work ( hotel friendly ) . I think 's priced I think looks good seems durable . In reviews item , seems lot debate Fender Mini Tone Master evaluate . Is toy , meant serious bedroom amplifier ? Do review compared `` mini amps '' , small combos costing $ 100 creep discussion ? Well , I bought one conclusion : It n't best way practice guitar quietly home , 's also also fun little product affordable price sounds slightly better 'd - Actually , aesthetics Mini Tone Master one favorite things . This $ 40 conversation piece I would n't mind work desk reminder one favorite . It happens 's functioning amplifier plug practice also ? The component actually used make amplifier cheap , yet put together convincing way . Take step back 'd swear hard plastic housing actually vinyl leather . The `` grill cloth '' speakers nice hard plastic facing protects speakers . Actually , amp cheap , 's also fairly durable . In fact , I dumped desk reaching write review , seems working fine . ( ! ) It also noted amp powered either 9V battery 9V DC adapter ( BOSS pedal supply adapter work , example ) . While battery option obviously nice portability , red `` ON '' light seemed noticeably dimmer 9V 's , I ca n't say long battery last . If plan one place time , adapter preferred way - The concept amp pretty ridiculous think - one watt output 2 '' speakers . Given speaker smaller `` tweeter '' large stereo speaker , wo n't surprised hear 's virtually bass sound . It sounds like poor 10W solid state amp , shrunk inches . At time , 's kind remarkable feat miniature amplifier , puts fair amount sound . I opted Mini Tone Master options actually fair range tones . Low Volume produces pretty good clean tones , humbuckers gain turned , get bit raunchy . Unfortunately , tone control either nothing , behaves completely . I n't figured yet . I `` 5 '' time , n't seem cut much treble I turned . Actually , got brightest around `` 7 '' , almost became muffled beyond . But , $ 40 mini amp , expectations much begin . I like four knobs , decision make power knob size knobs subtle touch prevents cheaper feel on-off flat toy switch.I expected speaker pushed hard , `` tube-like '' manner . That n't necessarily case , problems . Something internally rattles volume goes `` 4 '' , 's speaker . This common issue cheap amps , I might even pop open see rattling around . And sound quality n't objectively `` good '' means , good enough play amplified electric guitar hear basic characteristics instrument playing style.ALTERNATIVES - The primary reason I rated 4* instead 5* really n't issues ( I happy amp ) , 's limited usefulness compared many alternatives practicing . My favorite , far , Vox , headphone jacks stylized different famous amplifiers . The sound quality things pump headphones far greater quality ( volume/fullness ) anything mini amp could . Also , offered $ 40 $ 50 , 's simply better value . Another alternative plug smartphone practice software . While sound quality volume often problem smartphone apps , possibilities effects , modeling , recording think recent improvements small size Bluetooth speakers , realize sound quality device size could far better Mini Tone Master offers . At time , speakers cost $ 200 , premium sound quality never point amp . Your opinion depend expectations , n't take seriously , 's cool little device . And , book , anything allows practice guitar would otherwise nothing laugh . 
78	got product , n't used ! package looks ok , strings one plastic ca n't wait try one , 've also bought Martin , ghs silk steel , come back results ! wonderful strings acoustic playing . They great sound finger picking even pick still sound good . The strings new Yamaha FG700S hard noisy I ordered difference feel ! Playing went painful pure pleasure ! I notice tone low E string bit dead , especially drop D tuning I put one Yamaha string back got better sounding lows . For , I gave four stars instead five . These strings well packaged , easy unroll string guitar . I 've two guitars couple months hold tone well . No strings I 've tried like , n't strong character work together guitar . My seagull sound mellow brightness ! Also string perfect finger picking , I love ! These D'Addario silk steel strings excellent finger picking . A couple notes , though : ( 1 ) positive side , made U.S.A. materials ( unlike silk steel strings famous American guitar company whose name starts `` M , '' assembled south border ) ; ( 2 ) negative side , cost M -- -- - 's silk steel strings ; ( 3 ) general , silk steel strings squeak position changes straight steel strings , especially flat-wound acoustic strings ; ( 4 ) tone nice mellow , sort cross flat-wound steel strings nylon strings ; ( 5 ) D'Addario folk set easy fingers therefore ideal play lot , primarily play fairly light gauge electric string acoustic occasion ; ( 6 ) really work best finger picking ( whatever , n't use metal finger picks ) , less effective steel strings flat picking . I like strings warm & mellow tone . They easy fingers , I prefer silver-wound basses . I Alvarez acoustic guitar I absolutely love . I wanted , missed warmer tone ( body guitar slightly smaller many I always assumed I would never able get tone I wanted low end ... compared bass enhancing body typical style guitar , example ... ) friend recommended I try strings , , mind , guitar seen nothing short transformation ! Here gorgeous tone I missed ! I second set strings , I thing : I heard strings n't durable strings.However , n't bothered , tend finger-pick soft strum , , possibility n't become issue I would make claim everyone would great experience I , I would wholeheartedly recommend trying strings anyone looking variation tone.The fact easier fingers another reason give try ! Thumbs ! 
79	Kudos Fender making amp like available price point . It 25 watts power , 10 inch speaker , real spring reverb , 's traditional analog circuit without digital processor . It make electric guitar sound pretty much way 's supposed to.The downside I compare amp Fender selling fifteen years ago , Champion 110 , falls little short . The particle board cabinet thinner , speaker less hefty , whole thing feels sounds little less substantial . It 's obvious bean really pushed get thing inexpensive , also moved production Indonesia Mexico . Maybe weight factor shipping across , I still recommend beats crap digital amps gives substantial power 10 '' speaker real Fender tone looks . Fender probably figures players flush cash prefer well-made tube amp amp tons digital modeling , I kind wish still produced solid 25 watt analog practice/light gigging amp . got mine yesterday love , sounds grate , n't know amp get , looked looked , read lot reviews even got YouTube see people say , seems one lot good reviews , , knew fender good name amps , money one one , glad got , gave life electric guitar , bought mine somewhere else , still grate amp , ,i n't want spend lot money amp , n't want get something small 20 30 dollars less would grow music , get better playing guitar , figure amp fine many years come . save money long-run , happy , like five year warranty came , ca n't go wrong , great sound , , big , ,nice size amp , ,and easy pick-up , ,nice looking amp , , I buying pawn shop guitar , paying handed amp stated came guitar . I n't expect actually use heck , I could sell make bit money back . Got home set new pawn shop guitar plugged Frontman 25 see worked . I surprised find work , sounded good . I Deluxe Reverb tube amp little Frontman 25 Fender sound . What really impressive reverb , went nice echo full surf sound . I actually took small gigs well , I normally use Blues Jr small gigs Frontman fine job . On smaller gigs I need little reverb I plug straight amp worked well , plenty volume smooth reverb plus 's small easy back . All impressed decided keep . I would easily pay full retail , nice little amp , might even see I squeeze 12 inch speaker ! I several amps ranging half stacks twins little guy fills definite hole . I mainly play American Standard Tele 25R fits like glove . I love tone reverb $ 100 amazing ! The dirty , clean channel worth price imagine using guy small gig , I mainly use practice jamming night everyone else sleeping . If market sweet little amp rich clean channel classic spring reverb look , really great little amp ! interested DIY amp stand enhance sound amp , check review amp stand plans 25R website ! [ ... ] I actually bought amp pawn shop $ 60 , would paid retail price bought new , complaints . For small combo , amp really packs punch . It plenty loud , fine smaller club gigs . However , could use larger venues also , since generally mic amp anyway , get sound , clean channel would expect Fender amp , good tone crisp reverb . The high gain channel really fat sounding . I still use distortion pedals , generally leave clean channel switch back forth clean distortion ease ( sure foot switch amp , since pawn shop purchase didnt include one ) , without pedal , high gain channel performs price , really upper amp opinion . Kind away need half stack , unless really gigging frequently larger venues outdoors . Plus , far lighter easier transport , lol . I pleased Frontman 25R . I purchased practice amp . The sound quality clear , volume ever need . With gain drive cranked 10 , I set volume 3 . That volume I need practicing home . You could actually use outdoor stage level 10 . I cranked test , sound quality still clear 10 . I would recommend good economical around amp . You get 10 '' speaker separate drive control volume amp ; try two capabilities another amp around $ ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! This far best practice amp I found past 10 years I butt load new amps.I actually upgraded Champion 40 , still use amp much n't even think , one best ( $ 100.00 ) practice amps , unless looking gadget filled amp , case look elsewhere , one going fiddling around digital controls lost practice time.As addendum , I would like add probably try replace speakeras I read reviewers . I amps , heck , I put Celestion G10 ( costs 25R ) disappointed withthe results.This amp carried lot retailers , still new $ 100.00 internet search . I purchased love playing guitar . I like blues style classic rock . This 25 watt amp get job done . It expected high quality amp means . After months playing bass knob blew . So I bass control . Arrived pretty fast issues far tears dings packaging . You mess around knobs get tone want . Took like half hour get right amp settings.This amp rated 75 watts , technically could upgrade speaker say 50 watt ( 8 ohm ) . I would definitely recommend upgrading speaker celestion Jensen . I 'd recommend , n't buy looking really decent tone . It 's practice amp .

81	I bought hoping use intended , angled guitar & straight mixer , wrong , use way around ... sad ! Only . I lot cheaper cables get use/abuse one . Plenty cord move around . Makes less likely I going clip cord stroke . Just guitar doctor ordered . excellent I love cable , look good well made . An & ; guitar cable , really recomended , one . Try one . 
82	I n't believe thing perfect capo , one quite good . For reasonably strong hands pretty easy use . It good job compressing strings frets definitely well built . It capos , important take use `` rubber '' get . This good common sense . If lasts couple years I definitely purchase another . I bought 12 string one . Love simplicity needed I n't keep searching . Got gold remind six strings . I used different capo 's far away favorite . Very easy take , holds strings tight . What ask ? Does sets inexpensive . It says . It Kyser Quick Change capo . This capo great changing keys middle song anytime hurry . Highly recommended . It 's capo ... nice fit ... yet , sometimes I wonder fits tightly , I use , course strings tighter , sometimes I feel playing particular capo makes strings tight ... yet , capo , structured well . I pleased purchase . The strings play clearly zero buzzing position frets . I dramatically hear feel difference I used cheap $ 5 capo . This well worth pay : ) My husband usese capo almost plays guitar . His old one lasted 10 years . Worth cost . Long time Shubb user , decided try something different.I think I 've found lazy I . I ended using Kyser often Shubb fact put Kyser hand always available position guitars ( i.e . peghead ) Kyser turns much convenient reaching something guitar could change according situations , e.g . maybe side sofa living room , maybe table floor places , Shubb . These Capos wonderful . Perfect way around ! long lasting backed company . I three ! Good strong spring good strong materials . The improvement I would make clear protector holds behind neck . The protector needs longer . As protector ages slips end . If surface extended end base pivots would help . I bought Capo myWashburn . It works Orlando classical guitar well . I wanted capo simple operate n't expensive - Kyser Quick Change Guitar Capo fits bill nicely : [ Update 7/25/10 : My Orlando guitar stolen . Hoo ! ! ! ] - Easy On , Easy spring mechanism makes easy put capo take clamps helps prevent Kyser scratching marring neck arched arm weird-looking looking thingy straight arm help firmly grab without slipping easily quickly remove reposition Kyser Kyser made durable aluminum . [ Update 7/25/10 ] I 've capo almost 3 years 's still working like champ ! ( According Amazon 's Instant Order Update moi , I got capo November 22 , 2007 . ) - The Same Capo Colbie Caillat Used music video ! It 's capo Colbie Caillat used ! -- -The Kyser Quick Change Guitar Capo excellent ! I n't think go wrong one ! I owned several years silver colored one presently . The price right , work fine . My real issue sometimes , bunch bend strings setting whatever fret 're going bar , thus producing sound n't looking . Some higher end capo 's counter screws rather spring . However , like say , work fine little care attention placement fretboard , tell , popular model market . Easy use capo . Good strength - holds strings well.. Not sure 's good G7th capo , I still find best holding strings evenly stay tune , Kyser much cheaper good job . Probably best market . Very high quality sleek look . Easy use , could want ? I use capo guitar sounds awesome . I like put capo first fret I play song I made , sounds really really good . The capo easy use well . The description says color gold . It 's . More greenish yellow , intended . I think I would stick black color though . I really like capo , blue looks good light natural finish accoustic , works . However , I feel like deserves 4 stars simply could much robust product . For example , I think bottom part clamp little longer , rounded ( back side guitar neck rounded , ) . The spring could definitely tighter ... I rarely notice buzz quite tight enough . Also , design fairly nice , 's mostly aesthetic ... 's really super comfortable easy move around n't get wrong , rather good product , 's priced right . It n't high end product/5-star perfect . The package arrived time . This best capo around works great . Does supposed . works great . Just clip jam screw type , spend extra bux one . 'll happier , trust . I chose design obvious reasons . It lovely . Clear shard silk screening . The capo really good . It snug strings . got pink cause nobody would steal , know often capos get stolen people pink great This capo awesome , looks feels nice premium , works guitars much ask . 
83	So far , I 'm happy Microphone . Tone quality fine everything I need backup vocals band . Although longer cable would nice , 's great cable included package . It hard get honest review mike n't Shure SM58 . This considered gold standard others measured . Of course least part reputation deserved , perhaps durability SM58 sound . I couple SM58s couple . I considering SM48 , PG58 slightly better specs , almost identical price.The first thing I noticed box PG58 slightly bigger slightly heavier . It also different switch SM58 . The metal screens protecting n't interchangeable . I plugged one microphone cable settings would identical . I tried mikes , one , first speaking singing playing guitar , I changed settings , specifically , effects EQ PA . I repeated experiment , speaking singing changing 's I noticed : The SM58 slightly flatter mid range . The PG58 slightly brighter touch presence . They equal volume . The slight differences tone easily manipulated EQ ordinary tone controls . Neither susceptible much feedback vocal pop.I n't tried side side comparison live situation even practice , 's time consuming interferes playing . It 's difficulty judge situations , least awkward , I used combination two practice one seems able tell difference , except one person actually preference PG58 , could settings.I looked specs two mikes side side . The SM58 little flatter response , especially high end , Hz , picks dB PG 58 , somewhere 50 60 Hz . However , since human vocal range generally around 300 3000 Hz , neither seems likely much effect , although SM58 might tad responsive bass singer.I also tried two different Behringer mikes Radio Shack mike . The Behringer totally Shures , sounding tinny thin little presence volume . I tried Behringer 2000XM impressed similarity . These mikes sound almost identical ( The B 2000 Shure SM ) . The Behringer 2000XM seems discontinued , though , replaced , inferior mike offered bundles three $ plugged Radio Shack mike spare backup , even taken practice . The model number , probably also discontinued . This excellent sounding mike , good volume , presence tone.I n't mikes test side side experiment , I reach conclusions : There quite bit snobbery choosing microphones , Shure SM58 held unreachable standard . They ARE sturdy , good mikes price unreasonable , around $ 100 . However , microphones sound nearly identical also sturdy reliable , lower prices , including Shure PG58 , likely SM48 , though I n't test.I wish people would give unbiased reviews based actual performance instead toward either budget looking alternatives standard . I 'm giving 4 stars I n't enough time give evaluation holds comparison SM58 . This microphone great singing PA electric guitar . I sing worship/praise songs southern gospel smooth mid range get close enhances bass nicely . I n't think SM58 exactly I need . Built last Shure . Just got , used recording rehearsal , works well far I revise review somehow changes next years . Right , though , I 'd say great product . I bought one replace Shure . It 's big step one . I pleased . The old one lot handling noise . This one little good money I paid . My next one SM58 , awhile . I 'm happy : December handling noise definitely something consider . It would keep buying another one . Other mics I n't problem degree . I started Shure PG58 recently acquired Shure SM58 . I 'd probably ready agree argue Neumann mic costing 5 G 's simply n't much better Nady mic costing 10 bucks . But respect Shure , I 'm less sure SM58 n't worth 40 % PG58 . Perhaps sufficiently `` clean '' amplifier tweaked EQ settings favor frequencies human voice , two mics could mistaken one another . It attempts occasionally use instrument amplifier emergency P.A . led realize PG58 sounded somewhat muted dull compared SM58 . Switching common , admittedly expensive mic , gave extra gain I needed along added crispness clarity voice ( least announcements ) . I notice head PG58 larger SM58 . Since rise `` digital audio workstation '' ( n't computer free , included Garage Band ? ) , large , even gold-plated , cheap mics display place . Despite appearances , comes mics , size n't matter -- except appearances ( high school show bands headsets wrap half-way around face , knowing girls think 're cool -- look like ' 's ) . Some best mics tiny , opening size . good mic simple live stuff n't expensive . gets good clear sound switch helps kinds things

85	The MXR CSP202 Dunlop Custom Comp exactly I 'd searching ... For years I played crybaby phase 45 floor everything else rack system . The rack systems amazing studio quality compression big complex delay boards , blah blah blah ... days everything I sits Furman Pedal Board ( Highly recommended ) I 've quietly searching serviceable foot pedal compressor , harder find I previously imagined ... apparently n't easy ? I 've 4 ( cou n't 'em four ) foot pedal compressors n't happy ... engineer mixer buddy said go try pedal MXR CSP202 - I - 's perfect ... ) It 's easy match output gain pedal - step - pedal activates quality compression NOT output volume suppression2 ) It 's easy understand right away - 3 seconds looking pedal 're done - 3 minutes fooling around get it3 ) It 's quiet effective professional sounding4 ) It 's solid works exactly like expensive rack ) It 's expensive considering compression pedals 1/2 price2 ) It 's got 9 volt power supply connector wrong side input quarter inch thing Home Run - work around poorly located 9 volt connection - wait weeks save dollars need , ca n't fix bad compression pedal buy wrong one ... I highly recommend pedal , long process searching disappointed I 'm glad I found pedal Wanted good compressor front signal chain pedalboard setup electric guitar pedal working great purposes good price . Have set little compression smooth add sustain signal going anything else never turn . After trying every comp years , I came across , I Wampler Ego Compressor , quality Ego Script Reissue , noisey . Compression possibly one misunderstood pedal ( rack ) effects guitar players , I say confidently MXR Custom Comp gets right , makes IT DOES - First , quick word compression . The easiest way describe compression smooths sustains level intensity guitar 's pure tone . When play uncompressed guitar signal , experience annoying volume swells strum aggressively . On side problem , may want use strummed chords sequences continuous `` ringing '' effect , find individual notes die soon . A quality compressor pedal takes extremes . It also `` sustain '' notes boosting levels individual chords notes would otherwise fade away , depending settings.BUILD QUALITY - If complaints MXR Custom Comp , n't related durability . MXR pedals , like BOSS pedals , built heavy-duty metal , yet pedal surprisingly light battery removed . Unlike BOSS pedals , switch form metal button `` clicks '' press . My understanding veteran MXR users switch reliable long-lasting . In case , however , I intend thing time , major concern anyway.One gripe pedal accessibility battery internal `` Attack '' control . The pedal knobs Output ( volume ) Sensitivity ( basically , amount compression ) . The `` Attack '' knob , found rival compressors , degree `` pick attack '' sound want first hit note , whether sound comes subtly . But MXR Custom Comp , need remove back plate ( 4 Phillips screws ) adjust Attack know screwdriver . You also need remove back plate get battery , though I 've switched power chain ( OneSpot ) pedals anyway . So , yes , 's inconvenience , type effect , 's like would want adjust Attack way would mess Tone Gain distortion pedal . I consider also QUALITY - The sound quality effect outstanding . It far `` transparent '' pedals I 've tried terms retaining tonal characteristics guitar , leveling everything great `` finishing touch '' . Whereas I used think compression `` effect '' I would turn specific type tone , I could envision always leaving effect MXR Custom Comp . It simply makes underlying clean tone effects manageable better sounding.COMPARISON TO OTHER PEDALS - The toughest question ask MXR Custom Comp whether worth extra money . The top-end professional compressors ( Keeley pedals , rack units , etc . ) usually north $ 200 , n't practical casual player . Boss makes CS-3 Compression Sustainer , pedal I traded Custom Comp . The CS-3 affordable ( $ 50 $ 75 new ) customizable , 4 knobs exterior pedal , adding `` Attack '' `` Sustain '' . It definitely job terms adding sustain , might make sense want play around compression time time . But much like MXR 's entry level compressor ( The Dyna Comp red casing ) , simply n't quality - While compression n't `` color '' guitar tone way distortion pedal , 's arguably important overall tone quality pedal . If 're interested compression want best option affordable price , I recommend Custom Comp $ 100 less Amazon , used eBay , I 've seen go $ 70 $ 85 . It may `` necessary '' everyone , people try come away disappointed . Turn , play settings minute two , leave strum away . When I reviews , I consider well stompbox versus price . I give MXR Custom Comp five stars , sounds nowhere near good easy use Keely , pay substantially less . On hand , sounds better Boss CS-3 versatile MXR Dyna Comp . It also cheaper MXR 76 Vintage Compressor ( LED AC adaptor ) . So , I think MXR Custom Comp worth considering shopping compressor . You watch demos YouTube many stores sell MXR try one . If want inexpensive compressor LED , AC adaptor , versatile sound palette , MXR Custom Comp pretty compression change tone fully explored potential compressor . If would like evidence , consider song like The `` One Thing Another '' created part cranking compressor . The manual gives three settings might try -- '' Chicken Pickin ' , '' `` New Wave Reggae , '' `` '' -- sounds different . The MXR Custom Comp also give volume boost wish use function , I think wayyyyy better Boss CS-3 ( seems apt volume drop , crank way get boost ) .One problem compressor four control knobs , two exterior ( Output & Sensitivity ) two interior ( Attack & Trim ) . In order set manual suggests , open case screwdriver turn two dials inside box . Because , I set `` New Wave Reggae '' ( 80s sounds , funk , etc . ) manipulate external controls needed . If I playing country , I would simply switch `` Chicken Pickin ' '' leave . If playing multiple styles , I would seek different compressor like second problem MXR Custom Comp noise . If crank Output , creates buzz ( rig ) taken care noise gate . The Dyna Comp thing , I hear much Keely Boss find leaving compressor time sharpens tone without taking , time I easily vary Sensitivity get different tone/sustain . It give awful lot bell-like sustain clean sounds works great chorus LINE : ( 1 ) Nice compressor price , especially want versatile sound palette , good volume boost ( 2 ) Hard work due interior controls ( dumb ! ) ( 3 ) noisy signal cranked ( 4 ) Gives sound like MXR 76 Vintage Comp less cost , plus on/off LED & AC adaptor cheaper price ( 5 ) Good compressor price range ( Keely far superior sound pay ! ) ( 6 ) OK paint job , n't really catch eye 
86	I excited discover buy . I huge Dunlop strap locks -- dropped electric guitar bass stage one time another , I installed main performing given I started gigging new bass , I would put strap locks . But I already fancy bass strap lock mechanisms , I really needed buttons . I verge resigning buying whole set throwing extra strap lock parts drawer I found . buttons alone cost less half whole set would , I shuttle one bass strap instruments.I major difficulty getting one two screws way tightened , since I attached strap lock buttons least four times easy pie , I 'm inclined blame instrument that.Great product . I 'm know I get buttons separately . This great already strap locks want gear rest collection . sense spending alot money hardware wont use . price ok . Once install full Dunlop Strap Lock guitar strap , strap becomes unusable guitar n't equipped Dunlop buttons . Since I use 3 straps 3 guitars , n't make much sense buy full strap locks . My concern I ordered buttons might exactly like Dunlops securely keep guitar strap buttons look act exactly like ones come full set strap locks . After testing set , I purchased buttons guitars . The side benefit fully functional used guitar strap equipped Dunlop locks . Looks nice , hardware good , works great extra guitar might without need buy whole set . Now I one strap swap guitars fast worry dropping guitar ! These perfect using Dunlop strap locks guitars straps . These parts , quick USPS shipping . 
87	I ordered tuner I could carry around ukelele gig bag . It 's worked fine . I 've used tune ukelele , bass , guitar , works fine counts . I complaints . This good item served well . However I upgraded Intellitouch PT10 bit money much convenient really easy use . The Korg runs ambient sound gets interference background noise Intellitouch clip uses vibration 'hear ' note . Easy use accurate . Only issue tuning Drop b 5 - String bass ... takes longer find sweet spot tune . It tends fall quickly low notes . Microphone works well acoustic guitars . Works well tuner , I return buy Korg tuner/metronome combo . Thought would easier one machine . However , worked fine plain tuner . I lot guitar tuners house . I 've handheld units , apps phone , Korg Pitch Black , Fender thing , Boss TU-3 , TC Electronic Polytune . I say tuner I prefer one Pitch Black . This little CA1 actually faster better TU-3 hair , absolutely kills Polytune speed accuracy . Korg really knows build tuners , one truly great one . Works great acoustic guitars well electric , also fine job basses , . I n't know 's accurate enough piano , . This nice tuner works great . nice part works ALL stringed instrument . I tell 1st one go belly Korg 's awesome warranty covered 2nd one works great . This tuner want !

89	I tune guitars , ukuleles , , piano various tuners , like Korg Korg CA-40 Korg TM-40 , I pair Korg CM-100 Tuner Clip difference huge . You longer worry background clip headstock tunes quite well . On piano , I clip part picks tuner . It works well most/all clip-on tuners see various guitars ukuleles nowadays , one chromatic tuners n't directly clip ( like Intelli series ) , make work better ( okay , slightly exaggerated ) ambient noise picked tuner 's give accessory high marks , I highly recommend . I Korg tuner found I needed would pick sounds room interfere I tuning Dulcimer . Now I plug tuner thenclip onto headstock Dulcimer . Now I tune instrument anywhere without picking background noise . The Korg CM-100L Clip On Contact Microphone For Tuners great product . I would recommend anyone needing tune instrument . My instructor , playing violin 40 years , brought one private lesson recently . Because pick extraneous room noises , made tuning violin lesson much faster easier . Not good headstock tuner I purchased . I used times . It used tuner pickup acoustic . I would n't buy another one . I teach guitar classes community college spend days room full twangin ' ' n strummin ' guitars . ears tuners external mics , including iPhone app tuners , trouble environment . Why ? The cacophony competing pitches brains tuning machines . So I bring extra Durable Style Chromatic Korg CM-100L mic class students use . And works great : clip headstock isolates guitar delivers clean signal Seiko tuner hit deck many times still looks like new couple years . Unfortunately CM-100L nearly durable : wires thin , delicate prone breaking . If I one using CM-100L , would probably last many years . But students rough ca n't stop tightly wrapping wire around tuner 're finished ( although I ask ) . The wire gets stressed mic clip and/or plug shorts . I burn one two CM-100L per semester . I found big silicon sealant stress points helps extend life wire ( electrical tape useless ) .Great product : easy use makes tuning room full guitars snap . Wish made industrial strength model big beefy cables ... Bought tune hammered dulcimer . The clip bit larger I expected , fits bridges strings . If I paid attention picture site I would known large clip relation 1/4 '' plug.It 's job , picking vibrations instrument rather noise room . Works well things going around . It seems track ' clip internal microphone , meaning n't much . If holds true instruments , I may start using clip everything.I saw one review mention clip received labeled Korg . The one I got labeled , package clip . 
90	Brass Tacks : greatest mic world ? No . But budget mic AMAZING . The lows highs sound great mids sound well . If looking nice rich sound , it.If want upgrade headset , cheap mic , Blue Yeti , ; buy mic audio interface . You wo n't regret . I compared C1 pretty good half price . I also tried two . One . This much better hands even costs 2x much . I noticed difference guitar . On vocal picks fair amount around . But I realized 's normal mike n't pick stuff worse . The MXL v67g sounded warm vocals bad guitar got close gave fake low voice 's like taking AT2035 signal modifying 've recorded . Besides bright green gold little much . I tried CAD M179 . That better treble side seemed miss mids . I heard AT2020 n't good AT2035 I went . And 's switches difference I n't use anyway . I n't like switches CAD M179 either . It 's confusing I gain filter DAW . I considered 80 bucks 2035 seemed like similar . At end I 'm satisfied 2035 . It 's work horse costs fraction popular studio amps subtle difference . I staying away AT products I n't like headphones compared Sony 's . But time I caved I n't see anything competes price range . For works like sm57 microphone costs . I record acoustic electric guitar cab sing . My challenge get record echo room . I 've removed door closet , put shower comforter record . setup I 've save hundreds insulation costs hours . For vocals recording I n't use closet . Just use refir recording tricks remove unwanted noise . So things n't change choice best vocal instrument microphone price range . Nice solid construction vibration mount included . It 's rugged I like . The best deal recording beginners . This mic handle anything vocal , guitar , drum , 's definitely flat natural sounding , I like . Just aware comes plastic shock mount , metal one like AT2020 comes . However , 's usable . I write record music . I use microphone vocals acoustic guitar . I replaced cable came Mogami sounds great . clear n't color recordings . It pick ambient noise front , 's expected . It pretty good job blocking ambient noise back . Be sure get pop filter go . part u dont u use eq wash bit quite good ... CAN BE , beware ... priceHighly recommended ... price ranges..stick known shure , , , etc ... come newbies , models , etc etc ... fun I 've professional broadcast studios n't mics nice one . Good flat response , also click bass roll get little cleaner voice n't like EQ fact . Sounds like million bucks . This great . It first condenser mic , $ 149 steal.I 've always used Shure Heil mics cost $ 250 ... This mic studio application smokes . It obviously clear pure moment try . But really want amazed , A/B mic convinced purchase Audio-Technica . Cant wait get I review also . Enjoyable mic , decent frequency response range , nice pick much ambient room noise . I usually post-processing vocals , genres I work 's exactly rare thing . Either way sounds way better I would expect mic price . Have n't tried drums guitar I 'm impressed 's ability accurately capture vocals . While n't warmth mics relay , I prefer way . It leaves really clean , slightly feeling , warmed post production value sound , complaints shock mount . Though make sure cautious mic placement , get pop filter , room lots ambient noise n't shocked picks . All good deal . 
91	This processor okay home practice need something dry signal . The sound little electronic . I bought sounds much better . This little unit packed great effects . For $ 50 , I 'm impressed . Has everything need entry-level pedal , except pedal control ! ! I like drum machine tuner , I n't like effects , I n't electric guitar , I acoustic electric guitars , I thought maybe I could make sound like electric , sounds distorted , clean , sound electric guitar maybe would work fine , acoustic electric guitar . These types pedals toys . They cheap way beginner effects play . By means buying kid started playing . If , recommend slowly building pedal collection use money get 1 decent pedal whether delay , distortion . Works well good sound . I really enjoy versatility amp sounds . The interface could easier use price point one ca n't really complain . I friend one loves . I got one recommendation I put batteries , started smoking . It work awhile . I pulled batteries tried AC adapter smoked , time work . I one people gives item one try work , holds . I would advise anybody get . This particular brand I 've seen around n't heard much , one I got worked fine couple days . It went I sent hoping rule possibility I MIGHT gotten bad I requested letter I sent send another one exchange , That n't work well , way I COULD never receiving replacement verify got bad one , I 'd rate one bottom ... 
92	Its ok . It says , youre using one pedal get loud white noise background . I got mail today plugged pedal board prior amp . Like reviewers , I 'm sad report 's quite ' . I hoped would hissing type pedal . I 'm using Line 6 Uber Metal , Boss Metal Zone , Ibanez Metal & Boss SKB pedal board . The board noisy pedal cranked BUT I put EQ700 others , 's noticeable hiss though much low volume crank amp ( I 'm using Peavey Special 212 combo ) 4 , definitely hear hiss . Not sure noise gate pedal would reduce I 'm going give Danaelectro Fish & Chips ( recommended another reviewer ) try.I 'm waiting Behringer Orchestra Chorus pedal arrive n't hissy like EQ700 say though I like tone influence pedal . It nice job altering tone & gives rig greater flexibility sounds.Overall I give pedal 3 5 stars . It good pedal . It heavy price good . It good choice beginner . Thank . This little guy needs . Once plugged board yourelf monitor without worrying sound guy . Now I use clean channel amp , pedal , acoustic guitar leaves channel 2 pedals electric guitar . If want eq pedal right away tweak sounds , think GREAT . People trying hate , fine , I expecting worst reviews , still wanted I got anyway . You n't need adapter push ( behringer brand 9v ) , best way work turn bands ALL THE WAY DOWN , go one till get guitar sound like , turn test go back `` sound '' hear difference . It works nicely , price steal . In future I may get expensive one , seems fine . n't let system absorbs ! device others really great money , check everything ! good devices cost 3-4 times . Behringer pedals really cheaply made feel amazingly light , cheap unable take riggors gigging . I n't want spend $ 100 Boss version , get pay ! Another thing I hate 's really hard change battery , unlike Boss pedals . save money steer clear one . I also bought Behringer power amp $ 200 lasted gigs befor crapped . go high boost frequencies , get noise significant quantities . noisy please anything except experimentation . Pay extra money get something quiet . Others complained right . If want experiment equalization , good cheap . Some complained band boosting others . This user problem manufacturing . If want isolate frequency range , boost range cut ones 'll get narrow range . In respect , like MXR 6 band . This pedal works well rig , I two Boss 's advanced EQ 's sometimes complicated due 10 bands , little toy trick , well , I think people writes negative reviews n't know use , require time experience much expensive equipment compare pedal good eq price unbeatable , highly recommended ... go overpriced $ 100+ Boss original unit , end , maybe little quieter essentially know . I n't real praise complaints . I , price , 's pretty good . Like pedals , used 9V plug-in transformer , 's included . Yes , 's made plastic , ca n't expect $ 25 .

95	These strings sound amazing . They also last really long time keep sounding amazing . I get better harmonics strings well . I tend sweat I play , coated strings necessity . These good coated string market , I prefer thinner coating super light strings . Everyone preferences try different gauges manufacturers find favorite string . These provide nice smooth feel providing excellent tone last reasonably well . Of course depends playing style much fingers sweat play ! Oh , favor store guitars cases playing . The guitar strings last longer thank . These last long say last longer strings . I like . sorry noticed difference believe price really good hype put strings I tried knowing expect , pleasantly surprised . I tend sweaty hands , guitar strings get lot crud eventually rust . Although I learned wipe time I play , still deteriorate pretty quickly , 's pain . When I wipe cloth , leave black streaks crud Elixirs bright strings first put -- true . However , strings lose brightness hours playing , I n't see major disadvantage . The advantage strings get little crud . When I wipe , 's nothing cloth ! I 've even stopped wiping strings player like , godsend . I n't detect loss tone . They bit slippery , people reported trouble , 's fine 're worth try . Although 're twice expensive regular strings , 'll last longer , 're worth checking ! Ernie Ball makes titanium coated strings I 'm interested trying , brands , . These strings great tone feel . They seem maintain tone quality long period time . like guage 'd like these.. I tried , try.. I 've confirmed I like heavier gauges . 
96	I unaware I originally purchased threaded mic mount back extension pole . I already couple 13 '' posi-lok boom arms I popped able reclaim two floor mic stands save little bit floor space . They fairly well constructed price fit perfectly small home studio . The mics perfectly positioned dont get kicked around anymore . The reason I stopped using amp stands I could n't find anything collapsible . It works well sturdy ... I use Hot Rod . The box contained bag bottom half stand . The top section mic thread attachment missing . Sent back reorder . I love stand . I really disappointed cheap , , bolt-in hardware used adjust telescoping rear think stand last long time n't adjust much , much better would designed one pressure flip tab , limited holes drilled rear leg ? The hardware n't much better.For $ 50 ( list price ) stand , On Stage took cheap route rather quality route . Well , 's On Stage product , Hercules , K & M ; , , Ultimate Support . Cheap stuff , budget brand , trying pass name idea though , price right $ 25 street . Hopefully better make put something road-worthy . This stand rocks ! Literally ! I n't even play guitar anymore , aside , thing really nice . I added boom stand I run SM57 surround amp 's speaker . I went ahead ordered two another amp , I n't switch . I couple medium sized amps ( 2 x 10 's ) , I would highly recommend stand amplifiers around size . This may great smaller amps . I honestly skeptical actually trying . The specs seemed would support heavy , expensive hand-made 1x12 cabinet matching head . It seemed design would allow tilt back pair absolutely delivered . The upright support back extends quite bit protective foam moveable positioned right location . I truly impressed using weekend weekend gigging band soundly recommend product .

100	I think right splitting light medium gauges . What resulted perfect gauge string . They almost sound good mediums feature playability lights . I also think strings last decent amount time , particularly wipe strings playing ( I need get better ) . Bottom line : I highly recommend ; strings I use using several years . I 've always played light gauge strings really wanted sound guitar I found took gamble set I disappointed . There immediate notice sound difference also playablility guitar became little challenging . They offer warm tone good balance overall throughout strings . I 've always liked Ernie Ball strings great starter set upgrade . Would recommend level guitar player ! I changed strings new Martins I got recently . They bloody awful ! Luckily , I 'd also picked package Ernie Ball strings . First , packaged better Martins , went easily I tuned , sound SO much better ! Thank Ernie Ball , making far superior strings . My guitar thanks well ( grin ) . pretty happy got finally used likely pick need . I always LOVE THESE ! I getting ripped Brick & shoppe tool trade . This set strings fantastic . I 've playing ten years , tried everything Elixirs , D'Addario , Martin , John Pearse ( see I 'm going ? ) many more.I say money , strings class . When I first started playing I loved coated strings . I would n't buy anything Elixirs years ! Then I got married money became tight , $ 15 pop , set Elixirs n't looking good used to.So I tried every set strings sun three years.I finally landed Earthwoods Ernie Ball . Amazing ! They coated , I got used , actually prefer non-coated strings.These really bring `` '' tones dreadnought . And Medium Light set perfect ! Nice size high E string I n't feel like I 'm going snap I pull , good bass response.All fantastic set strings ca n't afford try.And $ 5 , would n't give shot ? Have always liked Ernie ball products , I thought I would like try strings , see work , I pleased ! I 've used GHS medium bronze wound strings Martin D-18 several years . I thought I 'd give Ernie Ball strings shot reading reviews . They lighter I expected . They closer `` light '' medium . I 'm impressed . They sound bright occasionally rattle frets . I think next set I buy medium probably GHS . You never know try.Update : I 've gotten used 'sound ' strings I DO like easier old fingers playing . Pure Bluegrass players like torture fingers heavier strings get mellow BG sound , though . ; ) At age I need help I get , I 'll admit I like like strings . These sound flat comparison Elixir Nanowebs n't feel good either.I guess I prefer coated acoustic strings . I built recently decided go strings suggested several websites . The sound I get AD & G strings sound great wit piezo pickup tube amp . The strings seem hold well . I comment well hold tune anyone knows cigar box guitars knows keeping tone parts like round head bolts nut eye bolt bridge uphill battle . These strings sound great , I thinking stringing electric acoustic guitar also compare two styles playing . I use strings gig guitar light enough I play couple hours without shredding fingers big enough give nice warm sound I n't like feel sound strings . I bought .010 .011 hurt fingers sound like tin foil . I would buy put daughter 's guitar , enjoys . anything would improvement dead strings playing.i 'll take martins , d'addarios guitars though . 
101	These stands I wanted studio . I like much , I five . I like easy access guitars recording sessions , I like able look . The multiple guitar stands probably safer stage economical space , stands perfect I n't gig much anymore . I 'm happy solid build . Good , solid guitar stand . Works perfectly Martin dreadnought Fender Stratocaster . Solid unit , good material construction , though made China apparently -- hey thats bargain ! Sturdy guitar stand works equally well electric acoustic guitars . The stands well padded touch guitar , back support would n't scratch guitar anyway , 's nice lines perfectly strat scratch plate . These stands lot sturdier would think picture - mainly guitar sits low . This low center gravity makes less likely tip knocked . The guitar little angle I used stands , overall excellent - I 've replaced stands . I n't know designed leg feature thing , need go back engineering school . When unlock legs put useable position , 're quite difficult pop open , opened place , see distinct spots paint worn , fit tight inside upper body stand.It 'd truly nice come across good stand like used button locks hold legs place , upright angle guitar . I n't like features stand . I read reviews similar options . I went one reviews competition talked far back guitars lean . Not much complaint . But definitely problem.My guitar quite stable leaning back less third stand causes . So ca n't go several out-of-the-way places I hoped would work . Also , I hoping use two close together compact 2-guitar rack . However , angle makes hope modify work , I 'm super hopeful point . Will probably manufacture something replace it.. These stands truly amazing . They function perfectly acoustic electric guitars take little real estate room . They incredibly stable nice thick cushion top guitar wo n't get scratched . Well built solid stand . It keeps guitar well protected looks nice . Some stands hold guitar little tube bottom , breaks easily weight guitar . This stand holds guitar two solid metal bars , last long time . It hold acoustic electric guitars . Highly recommend . This pretty good stand relatively robust compact size . easily folds fairly small footprint storage/transport , cradles guitar minor ) Personal gripe - git leans back bit I would like . Makes difficult wall ends taking 3D space really ) Product gripe - two footer bars quite level , rocks little bit . However , solid body electric , even little rocking really bad thing.I like OnStage several products . They well constructed good value I doubt I unlucky one . I 've applying little even 's getting better , relatively robust construction n't want give much . Kinda sucks 's level box , 4 stars . Very sturdy stand suitable stage use . This stand even accommodates double neck . Its compact folded I 'm still giving 5 stars . 
102	I using webbed , nylon & sometimes cutting straps years 'cause inexpensive ( cheap ) . Do n't know I waited long . Quality baby ! ... comfortable ! This well made guitar strap , exactly described . Suede course less slippery smooth leather , 2 inches fairly narrow . If want , guitar strap perfect . If prefer strap slip easily , distribute weight heavy guitar , wo n't top notch though . 5-stars . First goods : Sturdy leather construction cant beat . color spot pictures shown.The : It 's bit short , I acoustic guitar forward mount & # 34 ; shoe lace around head stock & # 34 ; method , I max strap make span . I 'm bigger guy , smaller person n't problem . Then 's whole friction suede clothing thing I n't considered . It pulls shirt really bad , making bit pain get guitar positioned want hang . That problem specific strap , material made . It 's high quality , I n't consider trying pull shirt . If , I 'd pass . Sweet suede . The feel suede hard beat . This strap fits right , feels good , looks handsome . Levy 's dependable , reliable . What ? Thank . I bought strap Luna 12 string . The strap comfortable durable exactly I needed . The width nice , wide enough distribute weight , wide . Attaching snap . The suede gives nice ' shoulder guitar n't slide around . 
103	These replaced nylon tapewounds I tried . I n't realize much low end I missing I put . Very nice . My gone 50 years , ... time I 've tried lots strings many bass guitars . I know experience quality construction strings improved set D'Addario chromes remarkable . It 's flat wound string smoothness quiet character found string type . In set , I especially like 4th string .100 & # 34 ; . This set , design , gives strong powerful signal amp , ... therefore makes even Schecter Diamond Series 4-string sound largely like early P-bass bottom spare . There 's ' ... . , ... .this string NOT muddy sounding like many flat wounds . Clean , bold , full smooth overtones work well . I really like . The price fair , 'll see kind life exhibit , I n't want spending lots cash new strings frequency P . Well , 's little , several people told I would n't like strings bass . I wanted try get closer earlier electric bass sound , smoother mellow . I considered RWs way bright guitar . So I put MusicMan bass . I little Peavey practice amp , may account bright still sound . But I love . I dial active EQ treble control way , bright-sounding bass ! But I wanted stand-up bass sound , like early basses . I Hofner violin bass , also ( shipped RWs , thinking ? ? ? ) , I loves MusicMan . And I love sound strings . Oddly , smidgen wrap extends nut , n't seem affect sound . As soon I get REAL amp , I expect completely satisfy . And WILL pop , , awesome bass , made Leo 's time MM . But want real `` vintage '' sound , pretty damn good . Lack good amp , knowing long 'll last I gave 4 stars . Otherwise , 5 star way . Yeah , bought friend ' band sound really impressive . Great durability tone . Maybe 's I cut musical teeth Motown 60s rock , I 've always preferred sound flatwound strings round wound , even ground wound strings . It might also something fact I play upright well . Flatwounds easier fingers hands , natural damping makes sound upright-like ears . It n't hurt good set flat wounds last practically forever , . I use D'Daddarios electric guitars basses I 've found consistent set set , sealed plastic packaging means I buy set today , put case , 's good new year later.I used use flats fretless , switched Jazz . Then friend told 'd switched Thomastiks . He found much consistent quality , smoother well . I 'm convert , . I recently picked . As guitar , factory strings left much desired . With fretted basses , I 'd always liked strings little . But round-wounds n't feel ( sound ) right fretless . Small vibrato hard achieve string friction . And round-wounds n't acoustic sound . There quite choices fretless strings , I 've always liked D'Addarios 6-string guitars . These flat-wounds perfect choice . They 've got plenty bottom , midrange pronounced strings . The bass sounds like 'real ' bass . And action smooth . I use small vibrato I like -- longer restricted wide sorts bassists look different sorts sounds . But 's something fretless attracts particular sort player -- player wants bit upright bass sound . As soon I put , I felt like I home . 
104	A friend showed monthly guitar club meeting I loved on/off switch right fingertips . Genius ! I bought 2 immediately . The shorter one goes guitar pedal board longer one pedal board amp . Works like charm excuse damaging amps issues consider . The right angle plug mm 2 short able stick Tele Takamine . It would seat properly would slide . I turn cord around use right angle pedal board side , worked , switch & # 34 ; & # 34 ; . I n't think Planet Waves first connector I problem I dont blame , maybe stick straight jack sure . Second issue simply little fussy . You make sure right position looking - feel wont . ( If see white edge & # 34 ; quiet & # 34 ; ) This third circuit breaker cable . I play church one wants `` POP '' I leave sanctuary . Why three : , , depending setup group - I hate cable jump rope . I really like right angle connector makes fit matter guitar stand I use . I love cable . It perfect making guitar changes without noise . The cable seem quite good quality Planet Waves cables still better others . The switch easy use . So far I satisfied customer cable . For worth , I used cables , first one I ever owned , I expert . A nice concept actually works , The cable nice , adequate gauge . Try ! Update : The right angle switched end started developing crackling issues intermittently cutting . I 've month , Amazon wo n't help . Despite lifetime warranty , Amazon offered let pay shipping give partial refund . Despite `` authorized retailer '' Planet Waves , AMAZON DOES NOT EXCHANGE THE PLANET WAVES beyond standard Amazon 30 day return policy . Amazon support referred manufacturer . I 've emailed Planet Waves , instructions warranty return dealer exchange . I n't dealer within 100 miles home , unless manufacturer comes , one quickly becoming unusable looks like might cost resolve it.I frequently switch instruments makes easy quietly . I 've used cables G & H ; quiet plug ( also works well ) , switched connector advantage G & ; use mute tune head stock tuner without unplugging instrument . The cable bit stiffer I 'm used , makes coiling storage easy , quickly become twisted mess stage length really need . The little elastic cord keeper strap works better I could ever imagined . I 've never given sound cable thought , bass player n't use much effects plays mostly passive instruments . But using Genz Benz fEARful 15/6/1 cab , I really notice pronounced difference clarity dynamics . The sound much alive cables I variety manufacturers ( Hosa , Proco , Whirlwind , etc ) . I 've never warranty exchange PW cable , others tout easy swap PW dealer great reason buy . I like knowing . ** EDIT : AS , YOU WILL NOT BE TO EXCHANGE IT THROUGH AMAZON 30 DAYS ** Wow , cables made really sturdy . And noiseless feature priceless . Definitely real good value money . 30 feet cable I paid 10 footer local guitar shop.I highly recommend ! A long time Planet Waves user I trusted circuit breaker cable would usual high standards ... IMHO not.The plugs great seem good cable grip . I like old cables long cable protector extending plug allowing cable flow guitar ( amp end ) . The actual cable horrible ... . hard plastic outer shell lie flex well like good cable ( e.g . like old Planet Waves cables ) . They claim shielding excellent I find mediocre . Very disappointing purchase . I 'd chose cable cause I older one angle plug needed another longer cable straight end . I like idea cut power remove cable instrument mute amp mixer . I recommend product anyone likes ability disconnect without anything else .

106	I 've using roughly year , works fine . It feels bit cheap , IS cheap . It 's easy move spring-loaded capo , 's also much lower profile . Overall , I like 's certainly worth ( minimal ) price . This pretty good deal look price capos , get free shipping.Yeah , 's quick use spring loaded ones , still bad ; better elastic strap type.It also great creating short cut drop D capos . With sharp razor could sorts crazy stuff.Do screw bottom arm thin . You add pad sort , take care over-tighten it.I 'm type person would glue small piece material broke . So , far n't look like though . This works equal ease across six strings , bottom three . Have n't run across need try top three yet . But judging performance bottom three , fierce grip , 'll fine . It 'll setup work , price right . I would n't recommend live use anyone changes keys every song , adjust get firmly set . I also would n't recommend anyone starting . A spring clamp type capo would serve better . This one probably best somebody rarely needs use , wants one one hand keep case back . works like suppose , good quality.I able produce music proper sound needed song.Thank You Kyser Capos I bought capo guys facility I work . It gets abused , I n't look last long . Would buy guitar . Works great , little annoying tighten loosen screw use every time.Some responses comments I 've seen reviews : -- I 've mine 5 years , used moderately , wear metal bottom screw negligible . Have n't put pad -- The manual screw functionality , I feel , give added level control ... make tight ensure -- However , range motion wide side . To get properly capo first fret acoustic , I put right edge 1st string , screw way , sometimes leave price nice though , I would recommend perfectly fine capo . I prefer spring loaded capo , one works ok guitars . I 'm surprised I n't broken yet . 
107	This second condenser microphone I say I love . I previously owned Audio Technica 2020 condenser mic sounded thin natural . I noticed mic really boost frequencies like mics price range . With microphone , hear ears basically get . Of course , room acoustics microphone positioning play large part final sound.I use Alesis mic preamp Focusrite 2i2 interface recordings sound clean . Another thing mention , variable pattern condenser mic . However , even polar patterns mic offer , I usually leave cardioid since I mainly use M179 vocals . Although I usually record vocals , I also record electric guitar , acoustic guitar , drums , experience microphone pretty great . I think price , hard find another microphone perform level . I sent back , probably due ignorance . Has multiple patterns collect sound . Was clear mike I n't detect body sound . Maybe preamp would helped . I checked many mikes ended Rode probably similar character . My goal record voice without color came close . I wonder could zillion ratings five stars ? ratings . Now I experience I would curious check . But since I found good solution I n't think 's worth effort . Ok 's deal ... I 'm small home studio type guy , honestly I n't expecting much I shelled $ 120 mic . I always seen around I thought would solid choice first multi-pattern mic ! The first time I recorded , I omni mode played acoustic ... .it sounded amazing ! I ca n't believe mic good . Crisp , clean sound ( cares 's made China like one guy says ? ) , flexible usage . I 've since used toms , acoustic , room mic amps , even background vocals , shined every time ! So 're like looking low-price LDC multiple patterns , GET THIS . You wo n't disappointed ! : ) mic gives great range recording purposes ! Seems well built rugged , complaint I face plate front fell month light use , must use cheap adhesive , I clean surfaces give dab gorilla glue get plate back I bought mic hearing good things , I never tried . It impressed quite bit since . I use small home studio set-up , along Presonus Firebox Logic Pro price , mic good deal . It sounds much better Audio Technica I ( ended selling shortly getting mic ) . I also got Oktava much expensive mic , sent Michael Joly ( therefore cost even ) I 'd say two mics similar . I end using CAD M179 lot 's less valuable , sounds else ? It low noise combines crispness want condenser without unpleasant . It sounds particularly great male vocals , opinion , although I used room drum-mic . I would highly recommend mic , especially price point . Got mine 130 , 's great Mic . I use vocal tracks , recording webcasts kind thing , recording studio guitar sounds etc . Awesome mic . I 've done good bit recording years . This microphone low self noise , low distortion continuously adjustable variable 've listened recorded mic compared many high priced options . This mic outstanding , sound mic simply disappears . . . records anything presented naturally great detail , without hype applaud CAD keeping price low provides great mic drum mixing would possible price point expensive functional competition . 
108	I collecting unique guitar picks putting pick display cases . This great pick ! I using 5 play well ! Really cool looking nice picks $ $ . The eye holes really make better gripping pick standard pick . Great deal amazon - - thanks ! ! I definitely buy future ! ! little small hands , kids take lessons loved . idea . Would like different holiday designs like . These picks pretty cool , fairly stiff despite thinness . They also bit pointier regular picks , eye holes give interesting tactile quality . Nice try something new , although bit slippery . I rarely play one , I prefer thin pick along lines medium , I pull one pocket play , always gets attention . 
109	I bought mistake cause I n't play bass works well ! ! good quality ! This convenient way keep picks close case drop one need chance different pick weight . I n't bass , however , fits great acoustical electric guitar . Good idea . Tends slip strings however . pick end neck . If 're bass player use pick , need one . If bass player use pick , *really* need one ! I bought one every bass spare.Wedgies work better bass guitar , strings thicker usually parallel . I guitar wedgie gibson , bit loose angled headstock spreading strings -- bass ones stay put.Really , things great . I usually keep pick mouth I n't use sometimes I drop , show time bend grab , nice option spare one , use bass picks , get , bigger guitar version , much like picks . 
110	Hundreds sounds choose , bands , specific songs , sounds.Built tunerManually adjust Tone , drive , bass mid treble , gain pitch , chorus phaser tremolo , Tape echo sweep echo delay , reverb master volumeMp3 / line recordingVery versatile Slayer flip preset . This amp non stop fun . Has many I head 90s sounds like sounds great low volume amazing models sounds like real thing . I got amp recently , local store , far im loving , also MKII Foot Controller perfect combination . Tons sounds 100 % edited fit demands . Nice volume coming also , 75 watts seems I 've playing rock blues 40 years . I 've owned number amps years including Ampeg 40 Watt combo , pre-CBS 100 watt Fender Showman , latest , Crate 50 Watt tube amp I bought 10 years ago . I also small Peavy 50 Watt solid state combo . The Crate always sounded great , 's I use exclusively basement studio , weighs ton clean channel always habit fading ( despite numerous repair attempts ) , I 've using Peavy I play . The last time I , I really unsatisfied sound decided look something else . I Line6 pocket Pod love I looked Line6 I found I could get 75 Watt modeling amp looper presets I could go lifetime less $ 300 , I ordered one Amazon , sight unseen unheard . Out box I amazed everything . The clean amp models crisp clear , dirty ones thick rich . The effects I played around far amazing , I detect difference digital delay , phaser overdrive pedals cost whole Spider IV 75 . And thing loud ! Very loud . As I get experience amp , I 'm sure I 'm going want tweak built presets taste , even right box sound pretty awesome.I 'm sure lot pro purists would laugh idea 75 Watt solid state combo 1 12 '' speaker main amp , 've got $ 1800 spend roadie , I guess 'd right . But money , sound , size light weight ( lbs ) alone make fabulous deal . Add modeling effects ( high quality individual floor pedals rack devices replicate effects could cost thousands dollars ) , compared $ 750 Crate VC5212 , $ 300 Spider IV 75 seems like almost large gain overall function . I doubt I use Crate ( except guests come jam ) .And less good ... It n't come foot switch . You buy one want able use looping realistic way and/or take advantage 4 channels fly , upload new firmware amp . And course really want ( ) , foot controller essential . I opted FBV Express Mk II , smallest least expensive model pedal . It lets access 4 channels well looper acts volume/wah controller . It another $ 100 . It really essential , mind price Spider IV 75 really $ n't come manuals speak . All manuals available online free , course download print . And manuals essential access basic functions amp . If access computer printer ( I guess people somewhere world ) , I guess 're . The `` Advanced Guide '' essential one using amp , 3 pages long . That 's short explain everything need know enough detail , 's particularly well-written . There ' another manual using free downloadable software lets edit presets low level another 21 pages long . I explored much yet , I suspect written similarly . Once , computer internet connection , bunch stuff possible Spider IV 75 able guess would probably added $ 150 list price amp Line6 included pedal hard copies manual , $ 450 , amp would seem less attractive many , Line6 opted handle things way . Bottom line still still unbeatable Tepper I n't gig . It unlikely I ever play front crowd . But 're like , play hobby like around various sounds genres , amp blast . It likely I play Johnny song Tuesday Metallica song . Pretty much make sure guitar tune dial sound . No pedals , hours minor tweaks , punch learn song . Virtually every genre represented . I also mention although I like metal , I rarely play . I prefer traditional R ' n ' R sounds Spider IV recreates tons favorites addition high gain ultra noisey sounds . Even best modeling world , Les Paul sound like Strat played 65 ' Fender . It sounds digital . No getting around else weighed purchase durability . Although I play fun , I still play 2-3 hours day . My 9 year old also learning play , gets lot use moves game room garage bedroom daily . The one thing common virtually reviews Line 6 amps long lasting durable . I family member professional musician one band members gig larger 120 becuase take I decided price ( $ 300 time ) , I could n't beat Line 6 . There comparing tube amp effect pedals solid state modeling amp . They sound better , prefessional . They also designed played loud get tubes . Although Line 6 sounds tinny max volume , home play , sounds terrific . There reviews compare Line 6 Vox , Marshall Fender . They ALL better Line6 , every one . But prepared pay 10 times price effects pedals , head units , cabinets , cables , etc . get flawless professional sounds . Good amp , great value . I looking amp home practice live playing . Ultimately , search narrowed Spider Fender Mustang . After reading many Amazon reviews , I ultimately chose Spider Fender ( ) I read Fender amps gave hissing noise , particularly clean channels , ( ii ) Spider better rock/metal tones , one genre I play , among others . Regarding sound , unbelievable ! And , quite honest , I 've using presets ! The cleans ultra clear , rock tones amazing . And , thing LOUD . In conducting internet research , amp necessary , fact , recommended . I discovered reason `` sweet spot '' volume going amp three-quarters way . In home practice , unless n't married live , wo n't get . With live play , could hold 's sweet spot . As another reviewer mentioned , need something louder 're larger venue , amp mic 'd anyway.One note ... Line 6 somewhat force purchase one pedals need pedal update amp . I purchased theLine 6 FBV Express Foot Controller , I 'm happy . I like larger foot pedal switches switch , rather small buttons model ( 6 button pedal board ) , I chose Spider IV Spider IV 120 amp version , part , Spider larger speaker ( 12 '' ) Spider IV 120 watt model two 10 '' speakers . I feel larger speaker provides better lower tones . I started two years ago 15 watt Spider III , along amps , bought Spider Jam . I thought great . Now come Spider IV , difference sound dramatic . They getting , close tube sound . So much lousy $ 299 , compared say $ 1000+ 75 watts tube , real steal.Loaded features , hundreds presets , something everyone . The Pitch Shifter 18 available manual settings add fun . And work either generation FBV pedalboard . Says right manual . The difference I see generation II pedal get USB port.Does sound creamy smooth Peavey Delta Blues Crate Palomino tube units ? No , still little digital overlay around . But people looking great home based amp , maybe church small gig amp , price nuts . Forget Peavy Vyper , hands much better n't sink another couple hundred pedal get presets like Vyper . Wow ! This little amp packs tons tone & sound . Hundreds presets going take time explore fully . The clean channels really clean & dirty channels plain nasty . 75 watts enough power blow socks . Lots bang buck . A modeling amp literally model existing Amps , Artists , Songs different years.This amp board song drum loops like Spider Jam.If trying get specific sound band musician place time , isyour amp.If need practice amp , go Jam.I amps far I concerned , Jam far better modeling amp Spider 4 plus drum song tracks play along plus whole lot , even based Spider 3 technology JM4 Looper engine.While Spider 4 ( I 150 ) nice amp , VERY SPECIFIC user needs isnot flexible.I agree amps worthless without foot pedals , I used Jam longtime without , acquired Express pedal I ordered Spider 4.Also aware Line 6 documentation amps , lacking , put mildly , so-called line videos user groups lacking documentation . I several tube amp combo half-stack . However , I wanted smaller , lighter combo would easy transport would n't need pedals , would also loud enough practice drummer . The line 6 spider IV combo perfect solution . Up point I n't impressed solid-state technology . Sure , cleans glassy , sound ok gain cranked mids scooped super low volume , soon turn volume bit try dial smooth , bluesy overdrive , sound turns crap . Not spider IV . I 've extremely impressed different amp models . ALL . The different amp models unique sound characteristics , means tonal options literally limitless . I play mostly metal hard rock , thougn I use less gain mids typical among players 'd describe hard rock tone vintage edge . And I able get tone less minute fiddling . The tone general surprisingly warm tube-like , comparison I n't make lightly . Additionally , highs n't artificial `` tinny '' sound often occurs solid-state . Solos leads natural , smooth quality tube amps valued for.The effects fun play , though I 've never used many effects playing . I really like multiple user pre-sets , I dial tones I use switch press button . The artist pre-sets cool ; 's interesting see Line 6 's take sound many popular bands songs . Some surprisingly good , like , Master Puppets , Your Love , others n't really sound like artist , like 'm also impressed quality celestion speaker comes amp ; holds pretty well even higher volumes . The tone continually improved I 've broken speaker.Just conclusion , 's basically nothing amp ca n't least fairly well . All amp models actually sound good ( ca n't say roland cube ) , combine effects , tuner , mp3 connection , user song & artist presets , 's winning combination . This never main stage amp , practice purposes I could n't pleased spider IV . : A months later I bought FBV express pedal board . It 's simple , affordable way get amp making channel switching easy adding volume/wah pedal . Especially main amp , I recommend getting FBV pedal go . 
111	I found perfect strings them.I use lower end stuff I probably sell anyway . We preferences I 'm Ernie Ball fan . They 're cheap though . Ernie Ball Acoustic strings bring tired guitar life . My playing sucks - sounds better strings . Bright warm time . Great tone . Easy fingers I installed Silvertone SD10 , dreadnought acoustic guitar . They much nicer strings guitar factory . If looking regular/medium string , real nice . Great product . No matter weight selections , I 've found Ernie Ball Slinky series worthy pairing acoustics . 're responsive twangy . I cedar topped acoustic strings brought life without losing cedar smoothness . No mud , clear mids highs . Mounted brass tone pins guitar rings like bell . Love . 
112	So good I bought another one . Love heavy cord gold connectors . Bass sounds great . I learned last night coil . I guess I read instructions carefully . But harm done , still works great ! I used monster cables years , good reason . The lifetime warranty worth price alone . Simple fact : cables break , getting replace cost 's . I use cable run output pedal chain input Fender Amp . After I bought Monster Cable hook pedal board I thought I would try another one update guitar . I using high end Planet Waves cable I bought 1980 's ... Once I found input jacks new Monster cable n't fit Fender Strat jack I little disappointed ... I n't return stated I use output pedal board . Save money ... I went back Planet Waves Cable ... I payed $ 30.00 back Planet Waves comes around $ . What I 'm getting get pay . I thought Waves lot money back day ... I n't bought guitar cable since one ... 20 plus years still working ... Planet Waves wins . Perfect Epiphone Sheraton II . Monster cables well constructed . I several never problems years . Got one I wanted 90 degree plug . Monster makes best cables lifetime warranty doesnt hurt either . This isnt top line series works great bass guitar rig time . You cant go wrong Monster Cables . Monster makes wide array cables , including high end . I initially purchased pair Rock Instrument Cable - 21 Feet - Straight 1/4-Inch plugto use keyboards , came time purchase cables bass guitar I thought I 'd pinch . I glad I did.I compared cable model expensive models I previously purchased , aside looks , could detect difference sound . I back forth guitars keyboards , ensuring model used instrument - still expensive model going looks . I sure ( higher priced model ) even sturdy molded stress relief ends model seem make reliable pricier sibling.Bottom line : carefully compare cables using instrument amp - possible - making purchase decision . You may find , I , higher price necessarily equal higher value , even manufacturer .

114	I owned Boss graphic eq many years ago never really took . Ah , youth . First , pedal dirt cheap , build quality actually seems solid . The sliders nice feel , on/off switch . If tonal issues amp graphic eq easy solution . No , wo n't make love amp hate , 're ALMOST THERE , even want add sonic variety , wo n't really realize useful vital graphic eq rig right strat jazzmaster Pro Jr . I love amp , volume goes treble gets bit piercing . I 've able tame issue pedal . It 's subtle thing . It takes time play around sliders figure really hit amp 's sweet spot - least application , I 'm leaving time . This pedal would also good solo boost , plenty output make leads punch through.Overall , price , ca n't go wrong . This one pedals million applications always use setup . I 'm thinking getting second one building pedalboard specific acoustic rig ( comp , eq , chorus , reverb ) . Seriously , great pedal . I ca n't improve upon others said , I mention points.1 . I use preamp dirt boxes lead tone , add crunch Fender Frontman 212 inserted effects loop . It 's run time based effects ( delay , phaser , etc ) me.2 . I sometimes use distortion clean booster , focusing one sliders boost . If gets noisy `` self '' , change battery fresh one . Better yet , use AC found last issue reading Harmony reviews . Otherwise , 's setup seven years . I take care stuff . Well , got one messin couple hours ... I still think takes bit brightness bypass 's 's great ! I 've thinking using mainly boost leads sounds much better ca n't seem turn ! 's light , small looks well built time tell resistent hey 30 bucks 's great deal ! This good EQ excelent price , excelent EQ give 4 5 look forward testing others danelectro pedals . For money I ca n't recommend EQ enough . It 's cheap , works well , small enough clutter pedalboard . Originally I purchased Behringer EQ700 equalizer pedal rig . It cheap around $ 20+ change like reviewers noted , 's noisy hiss . So I took advice another reviewer & bought Fish & Chips model Danaelectro 's terrific.I plugged directly line SKB pedal board , turned , turned amp , put clean distortion channels cranking volume max & discernible hiss hum . Mind boutique pedal tiny bit noise full volume point pedal cool 1950 's style & appearance . It great punch raise Level tone selections great help model various guitar & amp sounds . For modifying pedal , go wrong $ 30 price tag . If 're market great 7 band EQ pedal , 'll hard pressed find one price one.This product rates 5 5 possible stars . I playing guitar years . I play lead rhythm . I needed good EQ sometimes scoop sound bit since I variety guitars sound different ( much low others much high ) . I n't like interfering mixer amp settings decided get pedal EQ instead . A boss EQ solid yes cost ALOT . This EQ achieves almost results I paid less ! It 's level BTW . I 've useing pedal several years job . Yes , could metal , I wish button gave satisfying 'click ' I step . For thirty clams I look past things . I issues noise ( crackling oscillation ) . I really complaints 's performance I glad I n't shell money I feel secure I unlatch pedal board front . I n't think I need run pedal every amp I great job sound ' boxy dark sounding amps . When I run effects loop Palomino V8 ( great little practice amp btw ) little amp sounds HUGE . Also great front Blues Jr . If amp single tone knob ( Pro Jr , Valve Jr etc ) find tone stack lacking responsiveness owe buy one . Even satisfied responsiveness amp 's controls , pedal double volume boost playing lead . Once sound dialed , I leave typically leave forget . It 's also pretty shaping sound amplified acoustic guitar- I n't expecting much pedal pleasant surprise . I use zero tone Alvarez acoustic live shows . The pedal quiet solidly built . The price great . This basic EQ pedal , bit noisy testing . Even running battery power , bit hiss enough annoying rig probably enought annoying higher gain rigs . For cheap EQ great . Sometimes though I hit switch light turns second signal comes back . If would 5 star rating . I worried pedal + loop pedal still cheaper MXR Boss Eq 's I needed EQ pedal since current amp way adjusting 's EQ . Most distortion pedals I plugged ended sounding way & # 34 ; bassy & # 34 ; , I bought hopes would help clear little . I really n't expect much since pedal cheap ; brand new one ; I completely surprised worked also helped improve overall sound fiddling band adding nice richness overall mids . If 're looking cheap way dial tone guitar , I 'd recommend . I bought EQ pedal use 70 's amp project . I replaced speaker needed mids I bought pedal use clean channel . The EQ boost works great plastic box . I seen F & C ; called gold plastic box ' Telecaster forum read reviews net saying thing.The EQ works wonders tone priced less 's MXR Boss counterparts . I going rehash reviews , I use bass/guitar amp works surprisingly well old amp passive bass . The boost combined 2 low bass EQ 's works wonders low end.I use Boss GE-7 EQ pedal different amp , F & C ; works well Boss long n't mind cheap construction Danelectro . I gig pedal plastic n't matter . I wondering long switch last though , price , Danelectro pedals sorted novelty realm , one actually functional open new sounds . I also tried EQ Telecaster pedal gave alot bass low end . I hope lasts long old plastic FAB distortion I bought used $ 5 . These Danelectro pedals great quality money . I use pedal behind dirt pedals added flexibility bringing `` brilliance '' tone . The case plastic , attractive , perhaps sturdy . Also button push effect leaves bit desired -- n't feel solid . But I intend use recording live use , I 'm worried . Anyway , n't many EQ 's market , price , ca n't beat . I would recommend . Had 3 years - works great , 30 dollars , heck bargain.The construction ok - 's plastic metal + rubber bottom , seems sturdy . Battery easy get , comes one ( shipped connected terminals ) wise , , adds tiny amount hiss static , raises noise floor hair . The noise n't noticeable unless paying attention turning . Besides , boosting high end , going get great front clean unclean boost , I tend use fx loop - 's supposed . I think 's must getting existing amp setup , especially amp 's EQ n't , cab speaker choice less optimal - thing fixes ! I would definitely choose expensive EQs , I tend take good care stuff . This pedal , fish chips , find taste nothing like , works pretty 've heard flimsiness plastic seems pretty thick/durable.The switch seem poor quality , break im sure either send get new one put nicer switch yourself.As noise , It n't seem add much , unless gain switch end turned high , distortion you.I n't gotten blast ( play bedroom level , technically ) since 've gotten , sounds good headphones.I 'm using squire strat , sas distortion , fish chips , boss running , , vox vt20+ , outputting headphones . soooo ... Its sounding nicer way.I cant wait get amps.I 've also heard short battery life . I 've got standard 9v think planet waves 's powering right , 's real test , hours least 
115	If want little & # 34 ; meaty & # 34 ; sound feel les similar guitars , set ticket.Just slightly heavier feel much tone.As usual , switching heavier strings may tighten truss rod bit compensate greater string tension . Good strings . They work sound good . I n't notice much difference run-of-the-mill D'Addario strings . If want inexpensive `` pure nickel '' string get theDR Strings Pure Blues Pure Nickel Wrap Round feel nice , nicer frets , sound smooth mellow blues genre . They sustain well.I know guitar strings personal thing , expensive pure nickels , price point try set well . You may surprised.I rated set ' 4 ' stars 16 hours practice ' string windingbroke second third fret Gibson Standard . No damage frets string sounded dull , almost dead . recently went ' 20+ years . So electric guitar strings basically new . That said , I never acoustic wound string winding come loose playing.I put another set electric problems . I heard anyone else . Maybe big deal , one remarks ... UPDATE : I still using DR Blues guitars problems withthem..UPDATE : I D string windings break new set . Different guitar broke onthe frets reported . I little research find best strings reviews aimed . I got done stringing sound great . I think I play . I n't know Pure nickel different nickel wraps . I disappointed sound . 
116	I got I needed . I found n't really need often rarely use . If I really good I see need . But keyboard organ . If use using large sustaining pedal playing piano , may appear little awkward . I love , I used Yamaha ypt-230 works great , I would recommend anyone I bought use home studio control midi keyboard . It I wanted . I bought use keyboard . I n't really aware options keyboard pedals . It n't work smoothly pedals acoustic piano , I 'd always used . Does n't feel either . Nowhere opinion , sustain pedal like M-Audio SP-2 Sustain Pedal Piano Style Action similar pedal much better choice . The price difference dollars feel action much better . The thing I 've found Yamaha Sustain Pedal good taking space drawer I keep electric guitar pedals .

118	2 15 & # 34 ; speakers horn built cabinet . These hold great year round . I likely take speakers make sure n't fall onto baby grand ... problem ... came today like computer said would ... box mint ... surprise n't even tape ... I opened ... pulled plastic sleeve set minute holding speaker cab ... thanks Amazon ... .and would I shop else ? It lighter , fast easy set bulky strong sturdy enough support heavy 15 & # 34 ; speakers.The material paint quality greatest price good last long enough worth money especially gigging 4-6 times week . I needed one , I n't use , I 'm sure 's going work well . This going use piano amp help sound amp put top.ffsalsa Okay go said roduct except works us supposed It 's cheap speaker stand . Heavier , terms weight , I thought would . Cheaply made , safety pin kind joke . Overall though , 'll job . I would use highest height setting , one two notches lower , else starts leaning . knobs seem easy tighten , I n't done yet I 'm planning treating stand utmost care surprises I put expensive PA speaker If really large heavy speakers , might want consider professional grade stands , work fine speakers 35 lbs . ( maybe , keep lower ) . They look nice , easily worth selling price.They include additional hardware mounting speakers , 'll figure need , buy things separately . I mobile DJ company 4 ultimate stands 'm really happy . This product simple job well priced . They little heavy 9 lbs per stand like look operation . I 've happy far . 
119	Sounded good . sounding stock tubes . I rocked night loved sound . Next day turned , amp crackling wiping signal checked tubes one making violent purple flashes signal burnt . I noticed one fuses blew well . I changed fuse checked tube still thing swapped tubes back . Id like see real set , im sure one dud . Replaced stock tubes ( Groove Tubes ) Blues Junior matched pair JJs . Much better tone IMHO . The sound exactly want EL84 tubes held well . I coming needing complete retube Palomino V32 I also using JJs . My first amp EL84 's totally scratch built older single channel AC15 , based Lightning . Initially installed JJ EL84 's reading many good reviews . They sound great ( personal opinion course ) , priced right . Thought New Mullard 's Sovtek 's . Glad I went JJ 's , looking back . I 'm running plates screens . First set , one red plated slightly . Bought second set Doug 's Tubes , Ruby 's ( select matched JJ 's ) . Performing nicely stock MIM Strat . Also using Sovtek PI spot post-PI master volume , like . tubes come two three places anymore ... definate issue places seller ( JJ Tubes ) specify specs make particular tube stand . JJ seems smoother sound . I 've recently replaced tubes little mini two Epiphone Valve Jr 's came Sovtek EL84 's 12AX7 's really impressed difference tone . There real small change , pre-amp tubes made rest difference . You n't need spend big money tubes ... JJ 's work really great . Purchased replace failing power tubes Vox , I say great . After little break brought new life back amp . improved tone stock originally . Great product great price . Bought couple replacement tubes bass amp , I think improved sound original EH ones . These considered `` boutique tubes '' , I think 're popular reason . Had year , n't failed . Vox amp , never leaves house , never turned volume level , I ca n't elaborate sound , comment reliability usage . JJ Tubes best sounding vacume tubes & tubes go vintage & boutique amps , 
120	Sounds . Very bright clear highs , nothing beautiful mids totally muddy lows . Do n't hope take chords . Only first 4 strings may ... Try fender 's mini amp 're searching little thing , bigger one . I bought I going trip needed amp I could pack suitcase would work similar amp died . The Honeytone compact , looks cool simple operate , three controls , volume , tone gain ( distortion ) . I found level distortion necessary volume . If try playing clean , distortion , 'll underpowered . The trick balance gain volume instrument situation . I tried regular electric guitar , lap steel guitar , slide guitar , acoustic-electric guitar , acoustic-electric mandolin silent banjo . I thought acoustic guitar would overwhelm little amp , I surprised added projection n't bad tone . It handy belt clip useless little leather handle ( looks ) . I using play electric instrument jamming situations everyone else playing acoustic , I adjust volume blend . I think mike unbalanced output ( 1/4 & # 34 ; phone jack ) would also work , street corner singing , instance , though I n't tried yet mikes use XLR jacks would issue mike stand lapel headphone mike phone jack output , might hard , I 'm pleased amp seems sturdy reliable far , $ 20 , bargain . I bought go Epiphone ukulele , grandson . It 's good starter amp see inexpensive ukulele guitar sounds like amp . For price , 's good . If acoustic/electric uke , ideal companion take uke friends , beach , road trip , camping , etc . It 's quite small , easy pack backpack bag . It 's great electric amp , surprisingly good job amplifying uke . Use 9-volt need , buy 9v AC adapter plug outlet . You ca n't find better option budget , fun convenience important sound . I rather skeptical little box amp , works great . My acoustic gets pretty hefty electric sound tone overdrive adjustments ! Not sure long 9V battery last , advantage small box , sound worth couple batteries . I playing past three hours fine ! Well worth money spent ! And small enough fit right pocket guitar bag ... one less thing tote ! Looks really cool ! I say little guy packs punch 20 bucks . I needed something I could plug super portable cheap . Also works well iPhone set want use larger effects little guy n't come . Also little guy n't 9volt batteries like guitar gear tends . The minor flaw 's made plastic need something durable maybe get solid state amp plugs wall outlet ... buy two , 20 bucks . like stars say ... great around house playing , lately noticed cut ... strum shuts somrtimes , sure battery like song playing ... turn back usally works fine ... people made discovery also ... $ 20 ... 'm going live , belt clip want look really silly playing ... glued pelvis ! ! ! Fun little rig . Needed something play electric headphones , offered plus mini amp needed . The sound quality surprisingly hot . This portable 9volt amp pretty loud without sacrificing tone . It 's way louder 9volt Fender mini Twin ( actually incorporate two speakers ) , however dial gain way get crunch rather full distortion . It comes included 9volt compatible negative tip power adapters ( make sure 300mA like adapter $ 9.00 ) . At $ 20.00 amp deal ! A cute little monster 's surprisingly loud versatile . I bought primarily travel I 'm pleased purchase . Do n't expect much $ 20 ( 's plastic ) satisfied . The amp comes helpful instructions showing different tone settings ( fuzz , twang , etc. ) . I also purchased AC adaptor since things typically eat batteries . In opinion ... This best amp category . I know people Marshall Fender . I plugged little HoneyTone I best sounding micro amp hands . They amazed sound . They said `` well mine $ 45 `` mine $ 40 . '' Too bad sad . I told mine $ 20 . Since n't say Marshall Fender , I pay 1/2 better sounding amp . If looking amp 1 2 watts , know expect micro , amp disappoint The HoneyTone named . It long reputation excellent sound size . That reputation earned . It double volume portable amp I 's twice size . The tone range generous ( mellow high treble ) . From I 've seen heard , & # 34 ; overdrive & # 34 ; function fairly useless amp size . It tends go distortion point . My guess specific guitars may work well overdrive , I use I prefer clear tones . It possible amp ( amp ) n't max , portable practice amp , works well . I 've bought three plan buy . I n't know I 'd pay $ 40 $ 60 , Amazon price ( currently around $ 20 ) makes great value . I hope 's around price level long time 's great hobbyist projects box guitar amping .

122	like playing home , means replacement 15 & # 34 ; tnt peavey works says shipping quick This good product . The construction pretty good . It give variety bass tones . You buy 1/8 trs 1/4 ts adaptor line amp sound system . This little jewel small hide hand , delivers decent tone decent volume headphones practicing indoors outdoors traffic sounds even . Its 1/4 '' TS plug goes directly bass 's instrument cable jack , one 1/8 '' TRS output jack headphone plug . But also second 1/8 '' TRS input jack allows connect computer mp3 player cell phone hear playing music source , directly on-off switch third position overdrive distortion , I never use . It gain volume output controls work . It also tone control I discern anything . Could I defective sample , I n't care tone fine described little headphone amp seeming somewhat fragile , I n't argue -- feel bit thinly made battery door seem weak . But I take little extra care drop bang around gig bag . If battery door eventually falls , I 'll use duct tape , little thing completely wears , I 'll buy another . It 's handy easy travel -- , I said , : Still working fine . In house , I n't play quietly rehearsing ... . I really want play along song put ' , I without even concern dogs , neighbors , wife . This device , product description tells , allows plug bass , plug earbuds headphones , set volume gain controls suit , play away complete quiet rest world . In addition , best part , 's 1/8 & # 34 ; jack device allows plug mp3 player play along music choice . I rehearse often thing . You might think negatively device considering fact ca n't control tone parameters like rehearsing bass amp . That 's true . But , big thing able use designed ways makes rehearsing simpler ( less ) quiet necessary ( lots need quiet n't always blend well rehearsal schedule , etc ) . I paid $ 50 , works great , ... worth money certain . Liked sound , adjustability , wish I could read numbers dials ears still ringing turning dial wrong way ! I find unit surprisingly sturdy feels solid . I n't care disturbing , handy portable solution traveling , Rumble 75 bit big take everywhere . I made sure match good bass headphones reviewers said must . This device blessing bass guitar practices . set headphones , I play anywhere house time also jamming MP3s ( mp3 player plugged ! ) small price far construction , battery door hangs . I 'm sure I drop , even low height , door 's flying along battery . Sounds like amp headphones ! Gain , Tone FX switch make broad range sound since wo n't able use pedals . This great little piece kit fun money spend . 1 star , nothing fell , plugs bass headphone side loose feeling . 
123	My problem I used playing Hohner Golden Special 20 harps . I guess I paid attention 1 2 star ratings . These harps volume . Do n't waste money . I guess thing worth case , case handles carry strap.5/25/14 - I said case handle , well I take back . There little strap inside prevents case opening flat . I able fold little strap outwards zip two zippers . With one finger I carry case quality harps inside . expectations quality price . When I saw deal Amazon , I thought would low quality harmonicas , good quality . I 'm total beginner I n't really know review useful . I nothing compare except Lee Oskar . They sound good ... 's 's important right ? These kind nasty & # 34 ; new car smell & # 34 ; , I 'm leaving box open see airing helps . It 's big deal , 's negative I find . Rock ! I purchase set , first , case worth 10 dollars . It quality heavy cloth case lining . The harmonicas almost unbearable play soon arrive reek like plastic oil , leaving case open 2 days , barely smell , still airing . I love light due plastic cases , even n't super loud . They great buy money , I simply wanted cheap set mess around try different keys . The notes slightly difficult bend , reeds still loosening . All notes play higher ones needed little encouragement lightly breaking little , harps sound great 5 mins break . I quite happy product , honestly could much worse price . The blues set 10 dollars metal casings probably better components , good . I would recommend anyone decent harmonica C wants experiment keys ... Good buy All harmonicas one case sound great . You get use plastic easy get ready play away . Nice tone fun . The C numbered base plate top bottom , numbers totally opposite side . I see people mean taste , 's hardly problem I knew I purchasing . Overall , reasonably satisfied , give good try later . Disappointing ; looking receiving these.But ; mostly unplayable . air badly . Easier learning bagpipes things.Save money get harps actually work.Decent case though . Hohner Marine Band , Hohner Special 20 Lee Oskar Major harps fit well case . Hohner 's Big River Harp NOT fit properly case - longer others , n't snug . I 'll either return case order two Lee replace two Big River models . Or , I deal fact n't fit quite properly , probably `` good enough '' . , n't played toy harps yet , first things first . I bought case case , included harps . I n't play , I bought daughter . They look kinda flimsy price , ok beginners play . Im beginner . Good harps . Good solid sound.I cant bend idea , 's loads videos . I harmonica 's thought I 'd like set blues harps . I thought 's made Hohner , must fairly good . Wow , I wrong . Too hard push notes . I would n't recommend anyone . 
124	I use Hofner Gibson ES-135 . They sound amazing feel fantastic . These strings go Jazz guitars . Purchased new Heritage arch top . A months later , high E string unwound ball end . Overall good strings , good sound -- set simply n't last long . I replace 12s however . For 11s felt little loose . The 12s likely improve sound jazz box . I 12s Epiphone Joe Pass model . I 'll curious hear 12s sound 11s . I bought first set strings two years ago havent looked back since . Awesome feel , sound price . Just right thickness playing classic rock acoustic stuff I . I know electric strings sound nice playing acoustically written songs Strat . One thing I notice seem sound new lot longer others I tried . Thats nice . These strings tonal quality change life , you'eve ever wondered greats Wes Montgomery , George , Larry able get awesome , mellow tones . I 'd recommend even metal players change pace , may get something 've never considered . Obviously , takes someone willing give change accustomed style playing try . Trust - I 've playing professionally decades , I say 's way I 'd turn back jazz enthusiast . Also , 're interested saving skin fingers , product help , I n't even come close normal amount skin shedding experienced previously roundwounds . I put , wife picked guitar play , take time getting used . They n't rip hand much , keep fingers strings shift , less friction . This good , takes getting used . I used friction let know I fretboard . With , I found high like , sound nice , bought round wounds replace time comes . ? wound ? It 's , squeak , slick , mellow tone . It 's sound many would like . But round wounds ? Round wounds give bit grip , round wounds also surface area louder . Okay , I pickup , want mellower tone , sans finger noise . It 's important playing finger noise.I Les Paul harder edged music , archtop pleads mellower tone , hence couple friends really great Jazz guitar stylists , use D'Addario Chromes - nickel , I thought I would try . Nice , buttery smooth I could n't really recognized difference nickel flats , except price , wear seemed bit tear really factor , I change strings every 3 6 weeks depending much I 'm playing.Not ready take plunge ? It different feel , , try half rounds . They 're hybrid , less finger noise , bit surface area , hence output . Output problem . I use medium gauge , 13 high E , G wound also . Finger style heavy Dunlap tortex pick , attack noise also reduced flats . I like alot . I 'm bassist , familiar debate ( I prefer flats ) . Anyway , son wanted Epiphone Casino heard John Lennon used ( different brand ) flat-wounds . They sound AMAZING ! They make Casino ring like , yet get & # 34 ; & dirty & # 34 ; called . A VERY & # 34 ; different & # 34 ; sound range round wounds . In fact , 's time order another set three ... . flatwound strings I 've tried sound significantly better Thomastiks , cost twice much , 're twice good . Maybe I working pro I 'd buy Thomastiks , , D'Addarios sound good , last long time.If 've never played flatwounds , might surprised discover far outlast round wound strings . That 's kills sound strings gunk fingers air getting windings damping vibration . Back guitar strings lot expensive , n't unusual remove strings , boil , put back . Some electric bassists still . ) With flats , gunk n't get wraps , n't break string play set months.I different guitars set different strings ranging .010s ( Fenders ) .013 ( archtop . ) Rockers playing .010s might intimidated .013s , 're much harder play , little practice 's easy . seldom ever play six-string bar chords bend strings , means n't need much muscle anyway . Flatwounds also generally set fairly low action . They n't vibrate widely roundwounds , n't need much 're looking classic electric jazz guitar sound , flats way go , D'Addarios good need . ( Rockers looking 60s sound might try D'Addario flatwound .010s . Almost sound Pyramids , lot cheaper . ) I like mellow sound smooth feel . These strings I needed Chromes Flat Wound Electric Guitar No lie , perfect strings electric dull sounding . Will defiantly buying . Have Tele , interesting play around . I bought regular gauge first usually use pink slinkeys electrics , regular chromes like telephone wires compared regular gauge I bought instead . These lot easier play like slinkeys . They still heavier really feel bending add completely different feel playing guitar tone . When playing I tend play sixties inspired , flats help capture surf guitar tone really cool . I really like completely different I would n't recommend everyone . As far goes great , problems , feel great , sound great . 
125	These picks sound great , durable grip best I used . My main complaint small size , I n't got enough room vary finger position get different tones pick . I find Dava master control liking things , I still use jazz III 's time time I want simple clean pick tone . I started flimsy . A couple years ago I switched yellows . Recently I 've learning art sweeps pick ( ) ! For tone probs pick , consider . Your used using big picks , strum hard easily . With I noticed I strum tighter , stronger pattern get tones . Anyway , attack pick ! It flows sweeps like ... . YES ! I never switch pick . Oh ya , grip perfect . Have n't popped one fingers yet . Just two cents . nice grip , , , , great excellent quantity box musician lost constantly guitar picks I problems picking hand , ca n't seem hold onto picks . I really like Max Grips lot , found excellent soloing . Great tone well . For tastes , bit stiff strumming , perfect everything else . I love size would n't want anything larger . The advantage Dava jazz picks move grip , still pick . The Davas rubber coating grip part used sharp side . I would say Davas slightly flexible ( literally , figuratively ) . I use Dava jazz rhythm oriented playing . Can recall picks acoustic , I 've electric fan regular Jazz IIIs find n't slip much Dunlop Tortex picks . I think due materials pick raised lettering . Still , terms grip , n't hold candle Max Grips . Both picks unique tonal 've tried variety picks I think get used smaller picks , find larger styles feel clumsy awkward . These jazz picks also great pinch harmonics . They bit difficult adjust hand fly , picks choice , style , . Surprised reviews.EDIT : The strumming issue overcome playing around pick angle . It 's getting easier . I also since found fantastic picks , I actually prefer theDunlop Jazz III Pick Pack , Red lack Max-Grip raised lettering . They wonderful picks I 've used . I plan try 2mm picks , however , I suspect I 'm going prefer thicker pick ; III nylons feels slightly thicker Max-Grips , I believe I prefer . I 'm bass player I n't deal cut picks much . These picks really hard last forever . I notice additional string wear damage . These would probably better suited guitarists . exactly I looking . A Jazz sized pick ( smaller guitar pick ) works better grip make easier keep proper I tried many picks years guitar playing one far best . I using Dunlop recent years , best . The Carbon Fiber Dunlop Jazz III make long lasting want - playing rock ( slides picking ) better material , still comfortable softer rythms styles like blues jazz . Their grip excellent feel awesome . Got ta try ! Highly recommended . Cheers ! They tiny . About half size regular pick . My fingers keep hitting strings . Nice grip area . Will last forever , sound great . A bit thick . With grips comfortable prone falling hand gets moist sweat I reference point judge size picks perhaps compare pick quarter shot sizing picks though . These wear amazing great qualities jazz III 's . problem I dirt get grip pretty easily makes slip clean well problem . I bought number first one I used I fell love . They fuller sound picks grip fool proof . However n't pinch harmonics well , scrapes Low strings . Two disasters Classic rock music . I never seen picks would n't things , however I really struggled things seem easy picks . However minus two quirks , fantastic picks . Unless know 're , things small . If feel comfortable picking skills , size stiffness ( along built grip ) pretty good . These lead , rhythm . The picture wo n't show , size dime . I think jazz picks awesome , nice light gripped texture n't worry flying solo ! I wish came single pack . These picks good change pace . They easy grip slide slip fingers . Good investment price . I buy son . He loves grip help stop slipping hands . He also likes small size . They last forever n't break . I ordered carbon fiber , love I DO N'T loose picks anymore ! I used lose pick every day . Bought six , still six week later . : ) Here 's I keep : midway fretboard , slide E , B , G strings ( three smallest strings ) slide towards headstock . It little protrusions grip E string . Stays place CAN NOT slip . Wonderful ! These correct thickness texture I want , smaller typical pick . So sure try first buying . One tell size picture Amazon . I wish put reference picture side pick ( may dim ref image little people wo n't get confused ) . Some people swear , I find fingers get little numb playing hour two . May need get pick fully use effectively long duration . I wo n't buying . These picks fantastic , smaller picks I 've used past , easy hold onto due shape texture , durable , believe smaller Jazz use . If like thick/heavy gauge picks , find wear fast , pick . They solid grip stiff , also wear ( n't wear ) like nothing else . These nice find ! I got using Dunlop Standard Tortex Picks , 12 Pack , Purple , 1.14mm time.i would choose Jazz III better ME personally used hold picks wrong.Due smaller size Jazz III im forced better picker player . One day I getting ready play show stuck hand pocket ... pick gone . I checked case ... picks . So 3 minutes I start I 'm scrambling trying find pick . Luckily friend mine spare handed one . As soon I touched I though , feel weird . I went played set using one I absolutely loved . The pick feels great hand plays really well . And first time I 've played pick I knew n't going come flying fingers . After I got home show I jumped Amazon ordered pack . Like I said , I love things . This pick windmilling guitarists . This pick precision player . It 's really small -- noticeably smaller red Jazz III picks . With large fingers like mine , almost disappears . But aggressive grip pattern keeps pick right want . It 's stiff pick , enough give keep sawing strings off.The picks first-rate . Based previous experience Dunlop picks , last years . I 'm inclined lose along way , I give Dunlop repeat business . I 've always used jazz picks electric guitar work . , I would n't way . These absolute best picks I 've ever used . They n't wear easily delrin , tortex , materials . And , really , really nice textured surface keeps slipping fingers . I think I 'm going order massive bulk quantities stash away case ever decide stop manufacturing ... These picks nice small . My regret I taken time research size . They work well need little bigger . The Dunlop Max Grip Jazz III carbon fiber picks really helped improve accuracy , doubt large part due relative stiffness profile . I tend drop picks tried numerous brands types picks , ease grip hard beat . I relatively inexperienced player , experienced players address technical subtleties better I , I come depend helped hugely improve picking accuracy relatively short time . As far durability goes , reigning . I bought pack six , I 've using ca n't tell apart : three I 've used look like three still bag eye . I doubt seriously I need buy months ( knows , maybe years ) n't seem wear even hours hours use . I recommend picks without reservation . I like picks . It bit different sound obtained I use one . Will keep . To , pick pick notes leads . It seem like chord strumming pick much . I use light medium regular size picks strumming . I really like fit/feel plucking pick . , stays fingers glides fast strings . You might price I regret least . Some nice picking pick . I n't play lot I figured 6 ought last quite . I old thick stone pick interesting experience , . But Dunlop better . I n't use alot , I play jazz style music ballads , work better without playing heavy attack give mellow tone solo 's . These picks smaller regular guitar pick thick . I use playing bass . They work well . I used regular guitar . I prefer standard pick . A nice pick , feel texture . Only complaint 's fairly small - size Canadian US five cent piece , typical guitar pick bigger - size 25 cent piece . But 's okay . I got time I got set Jim Dunlop 427P3 Dun Ultex Jazz III , yellowish ones , Dava Jazz Grip 9024 red picks , I think I like Dava picks best . All three & # 34 ; tight grip & # 34 ; picks , size , 're good . These picks great grip , though , feel dry gritty even 're clean bone . Nice ! I probably got wrong gauge , things give due thickness I like small size . They half size standard pick , easy control .

127	behringer perfect play musical band real professional pedalboard rica I recommend ... behringer I bought I mess cables board I 'm happy say works perfectly . It everything could ask works Behringer , I Suhr , Boss , Fender , Marshall , Dunlop TC pedals fit well . It comes cables configuration diagram ideas , mention 's great advantage taking road without everything . Now gear always ready . Our son loves pedal board comes cover use transportation , plenty connection cords . He fully loaded pedals routinely uses . It looks stylish functional well . Very good product . Bought two years ago along fender mustang 1 . It comes Daisy Chain power cord eliminates need separate power supplies . Foam inserts easily fit Boss Behringer pedals easily cut house pedals . If using Electro-Harmonix , Red Witch , Voodoo Labs larger MXR pedals , wo n't fit styrofoam cutouts . You , though , take styrofoam pad velcro effects also Morley wah big , take good initial chunk room board . If Cry Baby , though , everything fit little comfortably . Right , I Morley sitting outside board due number pedals I four little ( MXR ten band EQ , EHX Electric , Seymour Duncan Tweak Fuzz ) .There hum , n't pronounced interferes much sound.So get fact cuts almost totally need adapters ( except DOD preamp overdrive ) , great deal . Of course , durability still question point . I purchased even though I use mostly Boss effects , I also use Behringer Wah . Some reviews mentioned Boss effects fit perfectly ' wah type effect . I must say thanks reviewers ! The issue I I 'm kinda slow , took realize I unscrew part actual board order wah sit comfortably . I also little bit apprehensive using supplied adapter pedals case sort conflict , far perfect experience ! This sturdy board . I must say though , I idea would huge ! This perfect addition serious rig . UPDATE : I 've finally filled available slots addition Boss Phase Shifter . So far board performed superbly ! Yes , noise ( always using overdrive/distortion pedals ) , expected . I use Boss Noise Suppressor ( Sorry beginning look like Boss ad ) works perfectly ! 
128	I bought compression pedal give leads little extra oomph . When playing pull-offs , sometimes difficult get sound loud rest picking , using pedal . It amplifies quieter sounds levels louder ones give smoothe sound . Works great used correctly . Not used dynamic picking sounds lose sound.I use Gibson Les Paul , Washburn Hollowbody Fender Super Champ amp along pedals . It cause major feedback using heavy distortion . This great pedal setup , times want clean sound cut mix , yet sound loud undefined . I used Boss compression pedal many years , Dyna Comp definitely refreshing step right direction . It sounds organic , less sterile Boss Pedal . I also think case , less , far controls concerned . I n't know , cant get clean sound pedal , use booster , really sounds good ! use want get feedback comes anti slip sticker put underneath recomend one . I like MXR products however I always metal button pedals possibility pop factor . The comp still equal sound clean overdrive . A must pedal boards . This compressor must bass guitar rig used often musicians ' electric guitar rigs . It 's basic - two controls one toggle - gives quite bit punch allows much stronger signal . Both jazz bass Precision Bass sound great pedal . I bought pedal local shop use guitar Bass . I usually put distortion pedal original Phase 90 , use standalone old amplifier even signal . I notice effective guitar bass , typical . I usually turn compression knob past 12 o'clock , using chain pedals , compressor helps even lows highs . The pedal seems interact wah good ways also . For price , seems like best economical choice compressor pedal MXR pedals built like tanks . I one Bass model years hold great showing age well . Its OK , adjust ability would like uses built like tank . got free girlfriend given old guy told broken distortion pedal ca n't complain worth paid . currently pedal board along Digitech less expensive , adjustable versatile . would buy , yes n't try anything else first . nuff said . 
129	These sound good electrics . The best sound I got LP . Good sustain strings staying tune well . good fitting requirement , extremely recommend beginners easy play reggae rhythm guitar good warm enough one point G string specially want lead solo whenever start bending notice annoying hard keep tune bending used medium G size This first time using hybrid mix ti take getting used I enjoy heavier bass sounds provides maintain easy bend higher strings . Installed problems , plays pretty well far . It stays tune pretty well , 's still first day pitch holding well . After using D'Addario strings I 've try Ernie Ball strings . I ten years ago Ernie Ball strings let tell 's best strings . In comparison Regular Slinky , strings little heavy powerfull sound funk , rock indie sound . I Stratocaster let tell sound balance hybrid gives much versatility play different genres . strings different really quite nice . high strings thinner thus much easier play bend . lower strings retain depth sound usual strings . I really like . possible difficulty high E etc might tend break little quicker due thinner string . I bunch hand strat Epiphone well standard Earnie Balls I 'll try review strings instrument 's kinda hard . I 've playing guitar since Dad bought $ 7.00 , unknown acoustic years ago . That make 58 . He put brand new duty Black Diamond strings pulled neck strings sat around 6 '' fretboard . Well , n't close anyway . The neck way adjust imagine learning play using heavy gauge Black Diamond strings ways fretboard . I n't know better I thought normal blood dripping bent crooked I 've multitude guitars strings . I always wanted Les Paul playing never improved enough justify $ 2000.00 - $ . I started reading reviews Epiphone Les Paul 100 $ running 4.5 - 5 stars . I finally , much self convincing , bought ebony Amazon . I 've owned Strats , Telecasters , cheapies , Alvarez I think . I unpacked box , little tuning absolutely , beautiful , sweetest thing I 've ever held life , ( except little lady course ) . No kidding , I recommend guitar anyone even cost couple : The ones came sounded great . I n't put couple weeks . Sounds great bathroom , good acoustics . I finally got best set strings . I always use Ernie Ball everything . They 've got wrench fit every nut house . I saw Hybrids Amazon never heard . I bought pack along Super Slinkys , Regular Slinkys , Earthwood Silk & Steels . I put Hybrids new Les Paul . They made sound even better . , The , Clapton , set LP Fender amp right sound good . The lower strings wonderful rich tone , 're fairly heavy easy fingers . The high strings talk . I bend easier Super Slinky . This guitar I 've used sound great . I imagine I 'll stick machine . Of course Amazon always 5 stars book . I strings much . They bend quite bit easy use . However , tend come untuned 're susceptible temperature humidity . Alright strings . Nothing spectacular . I 'm fan beefier lows thinner highs end day 're still slinks . I bought beef bottom end Telecaster came factory set Fender 9 's topped low E , small good twangy bass . I 've using months n't broken one even though I bend high E touch D string . I use D'Addarios guitars tried Ernie Balls hybrid mix n't whole lot difference . D'Addario sells similar set called maybe I 'll try next good . I 've always used Ernie Ball strings . I 've tried others & always go back Ernie Balls . They sound & feel great . Bend 'em ! strings I get Ernie Ball strings . Really reliable , great sound , got complaints really . Ernie Ball knows strings

Does says whining whatsoever , really quiet producing absolutely audible hum . Very small footprint , ! Would I recommend ? Yes . I would . 
133	First things first . If one many expensive guitars BUY THESE . They keep guitar safe falling . To take hold button side strap lock pop . It 's handy . Very easy install protects . Be warned bigger look well must big . I ones came strat I believe Schaller 's . I like security Schaller 's better even pin pulled n't going let guitar loose . However , problem Schaller would always unscrew neck screw . I tighten every use let tell , little loose , lot Ernie Balls , redrilling needed Strap Lock EB 's screw good long . You also n't put together like Strap Lock , bit stayed tight cause concern . I 'd rated 5 stars plastic push together insert release . That would make easier grab use . These default locks . The quality nickel good , . Earnie Ball 's guitar strap locks great . opinion , best way brands like Dunlop , Schaller many others . I installed Les Paul Jackson secure rehearsing gigging . You definetely trust job . They also look great . Highly recommended . My Les Paul The strap would constantly fall . So I decided get set strap locks . These installed minutes , really dont change look guitar . You need nut driver screw lock strap . If dont locks guitars , cant straps easily , I recommend getting guitars . The added benefit I found hollow body strap actually scratching back . With locks strap sits away guitar , fixes problem well . When I buy new guitar , I get new locks . Are better locks ? I 'm sure , Im committed I wanted locks guitars.. Has never failed yet . I 've found strap locks much better alternatives Schaller Dunlop . These look best strap locks great feel locking unlocking strap.I use PRS SE 245 I need additional drilling . The screws came product went perfectly secure.Highly Recommended . These work great ! It 's hard write review strap locks without thinking wasting time . You strap . You guitar . This locks together . But , work really well . Compared brands , I find easier use great couple beers . Downside strap guitar generally considered ( ) aesthetically pleasing . But , true strap lock systems . So , I say go ! I looked around strap locks Dean Dime Razorback , happy see locking mechanisms designed button top release . My guitar straps attach rear underside guitar would easy accidentally press guitar hits waist causing unknown horrible I saw knew perfect situation . I installed last night could happier . They solid lock ' feel click set . I sure work well guitar straps mount traditional spots well . This great product good price.Note : If installing Dean Razorback ML , stock front strap mount screw goes plate , body neck ... NOT USE mount , pull old strap mount return screw ... long likely split neck . Just drill hole right next install locking mount right next ( touch even still function properly ) . Enjoy ! I really happy guitar much secure n't worry I hurt favorite guitar . 
134	I tried 2008 sound bit bright . The heavier bass strings n't really add bassy sound I hoping thud . YMMV . Clean clear sound . Great strumming using pick little soft finger picking . I prefer string little volume . They tune well hold tune well . I usually use `` '' fingers wimps , I like bottom E go small .010 . I heard though , get oomph , bass , better recording use heavier gauge strings ; I decided try start using lights mediums instead . Also , I finally bought first Martin ( Hoo ! ) researched strings , I read comment one person said lights would slight buzz , mediums put much pressure neck said `` Mediums '' happy medium good I got Martin M , I cleaned , restrung set `` Light '' . At first fingertips protested got real sore real fast ; I adding .025 width E string ( .010 ) ouch ! I build callouses , take weeks torture , ugh . But , sound AWESOME . Part Martin guitar course , strings , I hit G chord , ring deep , warm bass thump . You feel chest hit bass strings , 6th , 5th 4th . The treble strings bend pretty easily . No buzzing . They coating , like hell . ( TIP : I put 2 hand lotion fingertips 15 minutes prior playing helps keep squeak ) These strings great , I recommend . I try update review 3 months let know longevity , etc . Tried Laguna acoustic guitar . They basic standard traditional strings . They sound good , light weight . On guitar sound bit bright . My preference use Elixirs , prefer feel sound guitar ( Elixir PolyWeb Acoustic Guitar Strings ( Light ) ) .These strings last less time Elixirs . Mostly fresh strings sound good guitar . Some people like brand new set every gig , others go weeks months changing . If every gig person , well Martin set probably perfect - much less expensive others . strings extended period - Elixirs coated strings probably better thing perfect guitar string every guitar . The choice personal preference guitar play . I think Martins good value standard traditional style . So price , excellent value . , begin . Firstly , I hated fact package two strings paper packet . Secondly , one packets , appeared I two & # 34 ; D & # 34 ; strings , instead two & # 34 ; E & # 34 ; strings . Lastly , certainly least favorably , tuned , strings sounded terrible ! They tinny sounding . I 've never heard worse strings . Fortunately , I bought package Ernie Ball Earthwood med . light , well . I replaced godawful Martins Ernie Ball 's far , far better ! Martin piss poor product . I 'll never buy strings . I would definitely buy strings . They high quality , great great price . The Martin name synonymous quality . I like even better Martin Custom Lights . They give warm tone , holding well . After reading great reviews , I moved strings light gauge . They sound much better better tone light gauge . However , I noticed one thing driven crazy . Finger slides much harder strings . The lower strings ( E , A G ) n't slide easily buildup . As result fingers get position n't hit clear notes I 've slid areas couple times . That 's probably due oil build strings getting used . The packaging also bit confusing . Since two strings envelope , seems I easily get strings reversed set . Other string makers I tried , color coded strings made much easier string . Overall good strings I 'll probably buy . By definition , medium size . But comes guitar strings , range goes extra light medium . On scale , strings would literal medium . For , guitar everyday instrument . I n't typically spend five hours day one , sometimes go weeks without picking one . But I periods I spend many hours day playing n't want something kill guitar string sense word much . Light custom light easier play , make higher end Martin guitar sound like one closer bottom line . For , light-medium exactly I want strings like Martin 's medium , find bit much times , find give much play much lighter ones , may find great choice . I n't feel I missing anything compared Medium . If I two identical guitars new strings type , I would probably find differences side side comparison . But without , I n't think I 'd notice difference normal listening . With lighter varieties , would far true.If Martin extra light light skim milk 1 % milk strings , light-medium would 2 % came along people wanted something lighter still came close whole milk taste . love strings , I always still fan Ernie Ball , sound better , bend easier longer life span , Martin good , I prefer Ernie Ball , sold I needed strings fast . 
135	I keep capo instrument nothing wore showing without one . I using Martin 12-string . The spring holds tight easily adjusted one hand . Best 12-string capo I ever used -- 's decades . Works easily flawlessly . Very well made . Five Stars This 6th Kyser capo . This one new Ovation 12 String CC245 I needed . I always recommend Kyser last forever lose strong holds . designed easy use seems sturdy serve well years come ... expensive good quality If play 12 acoustic got ta get one . Just hair longer padded area need . You tell 6 string version ridges much closer together one . This capo exactly . It clamps strings tight buzz change tune guitar used . I 4 Kyser capos , one guitars never buy another brand . 
136	I normally use nylon picks songs flatpicking intros nylons . These picks keep nice bright tone , little friction strings - low string noise . Enough grip stay put hands well . I 've buying Dunlop pick least 15 years , I love feel grip . The picks last really long time , I would recommend getting several thickness ' different applications . But sitting room playing around , acoustics electric guitars decent round pick I tried ended going back Tortex . I like satin finish Tortex better way bends . The Ultex little brighter attack though wears less quickly . Ultex sounds like Fender celluloid . Sounds great . I 5 different gauges . I like gripping surface . .90 favorite gauge rounded tip super fast . Guitar picks make huge part tone . Especially acoustic . These best acoustic picks market today opinion . They long life brighten tone . picks easy rubbing carpet carpet scrap bring back original shape . These nice , I like 1.14 rigidity fine ... wear acoustics though aggressive player I . Once worn , picks , sound considerably different . Much grainy tin-y may plus ? I also like side edges real mellow / speeding picking style . They stay fingers well . The grip excellent . But I prefer 1.14 . These sturdy look like I wo n't needing another set quite time We different tastes guitar picks , I know , As I wrote elsewhere , Dunlop Tortex awful acoustic , opinion . These Ultex much better . Not noisy , better feel . Still favorites . I 'll spares . I bought wrong gauge . I read review said get size less really want wrong . I bought .90 gauge Guitar Center love . These made Dave muted crunch sound . I n't know I use forever right I love . Just hard enough speed picking light enough stay hand without moving around like 1 Ultex sound awesome far still look like em ! ! ! ! I love pick attack . I used almost everything 20 years playing settled pick go-to choice acoustic guitar . Did n't think I 'd compelled review something like guitar pick , Dunlop Ultex really impressed thus far . I use .60 thickness , equivalent orange plastic Dunlop pick . The orange pick favorite acoustic electric playing , wear fray edges , little friction I 'd like.This Ultex seems resistant wear surprisingly little drag string . I find matte finish easy grip hold . It gives enough use smooth strumming , rigid enough individual reviewers noted crack use . If turns problem , I might reconsider review . But box , perform well pick I used ! Grabbed impulse I needed new ones . Normally I used old Fender Medium Heavy picks , I got ta say great . flexible enough maneuver plus glide nicely . Not sure could said prove , feel great . I 've used Tortex picks , really happy . This pick however , takes next level . Very strong great bite relatively thin pick . I use .73 acoustic holds true . Great product .

139	I replaced nasty , crooked , chipping plastic pins , work well keeping strings . I 'm convinced change sound D-28 much better worse . I replaced one pin time compared strings really could n't tell much difference , still better handle remove nasty plastic ones , I consider upgrade . I bought replace plastic bridge pins came Fender acoustic . These easy install using instructions ( without ) . These also sturdy look good . I installed pins Silvertone SD10 . They fit great lot better cheap plastic ones . If lower end guitar , I highly recommend pins . The saddle make bigger difference sound pins , every little bit helps . For cost , ca n't beat . Sound quality improve plastic pegs . Next line tweak bridge replacing plastic saddle Tusq . This improve sustain tone even . If 're looking budget increase tone ... way go . I ordered Gibson Songwriter Deluxe Custom Vintage seem little bit thinner slightly smaller heads longer stock pins pins measure : 1 1/4 '' inches length.I going return figured I would try Gibson Blues King parlor sized guitar.It result , little thin , smaller heads slightly longer I went ahead tried them.GLAD I n't think using Tusq bridge came stock Gibson would make detectable difference I wrong . I CAN tell slight difference . I remove strings , loosened compared set , fresh yesterday.A small amount improvement sustain high end frequencies ringing also provide graph packaging info , I think test using BOTH TUSQ pins AND replacement saddle . If n't changed saddle ... get rid soft plastic one.I must admit , I order 75 % `` '' guitar mind , amount tonal improvement would gladly appreciated expected . I got Dot inlay looks nice provides eye candy I seeking , although care taken `` match dots '' consistency , vary TUSQ Pins wee bit smaller seem slide way ... right away need pushed way slot stringing guitar . The heads set flush bridge mount compared Gibson stock plastic pins stick little higher , I wish TUSQ pins size.I see well Blues King likely order new pins Songwriter Deluxe pass test time playing month two . I n't expect cause problems provide extra sustain ringing much appreciated small amount fashion ! If doubt , consider changing strings brand might suited `` tone '' mind , darker , brighter , softer , louder , etc . Strings make big difference I find using D'Addario phosphor bronze strings bright & ringy , last long , affordable , seem noticeably louder GHS Ernie Ball . ( steel strings - apply nylon gut strings . ) Once , plastic saddle and/or nut pins might make much noticeable difference ... , might make difference world ! You try see.They inexpensive pretty ... well worth risk ! These slightly larger diameter original pins . This exactly I wanted since 1973 acoustic guitar restrung many times bridge pin holes getting loose enough original plastic pins low difficult grab pull . These new pins fit holes perfectly make stringing guitar pleasure , ! And also noticeable improvement sound , produced plastic pins . 
140	It 's great strap . It 's comfortable wear hours . It looks good . I got earlier expected I love . I would definitely recommend anyone beginner pro . work everyone ... prefer walker williams brand ... work fine easy get strap locks ... keep side next guitar ... shouild happy . enjoy I impressed quality strap little I paid . Nice soft flexible leather , adjustable . I lengthen slit one end fit oversize strap attach fitting Fender acoustic electric , fit perfect . I using nylon strap I got one . I love feel fact little wider older strap . The leather feels high quality end pieces fit snug acoustic guitar I n't worry coming loose . I bought five blown like $ 3 , even normal price bargain . They comfortable used extended period time- even heavy Les Paul . If play SG , help counter dreaded dive ' get using nylon strap guitars . Incidentally , Amazon selling straps 1/3 price would pay GC . Highly recommended ! I use strap either smooth suede side shoulder.Actually I like smooth side shoulder easy adjust position without pulling shirt . Over past couple months I 've replacing guitar straps . This one seemed ideal everyday all-around strap . And , would , holes tight . Really major chore get strap button . I slits force strap . I 've probably bought dozens straps past years , I never problem latest straps I 've purchased -- strap n't one I 've issue . A tight-fitting strap n't problem , except one needs take ! Yikes ! Otherwise , nice strap . Oh , I tried strap three guitars , sure first n't anomaly . Its little stiff I 'm sure soften upon use . Cant beat price ! I used acoustic bass plenty long . My go strap , brown black , Just plain tool leather , ca n't beat sweat breaks great , always well made . When need no-nonsense leather strap long , consider . If need something fancy , want sling guitar low , tall person , probably want skip this.I 'm 5ft 8 '' I 'm already using longest setting acoustic strap button heel neck well end pin , 's like I 'm trying hold guitar particularly low . If tall person , want Jimmy Page 's posture something , you.Apart , I say cost performance thing really impressive ( 's I believe `` made Canada '' sticker ) . Hard beat far leather straps go . At 2.5 inches wide , 's comfortable , leather reasonably pliable yet seems thick enough , looks bad either . Sure , product , buy 12 complaint I sticker left sticky residue back side strap . Though big deal remove residue using rubbing alcohol elbow grease , would nice I able use without extra work without worrying gummy sticky thing rubbed guitar . great leather strap nice color well made strong feels comfortable smooth , wont dig Ur shoulder like straps , , , u adjust , , adjust cut unnecessary material , , tall gut need extra strap n't like play low like knees , looks trashy cant shred cuz angle ur wrist , use strap waist height looks cool proportional gives A great angle wrist , able play fast move n neck , , , say great buy , , give 5 stars . My guitar strap I like alot . cut shoulder back . Will get one 2nd guitar . I thought I would problem length strap low behold little short . I like guitar hanging low strap n't cut department . Still , price I give four stars . You get lot high quality leather good price , wish went little longer . Adjustments easy make fit/feel fine . No fancy designs , great value price . If 're looking inexpensive leather strap , one nicely . Leather supple , hard , looks great natural finish guitars . My complaint difficult attach first ( holes smaller usual , probably anomaly ) . So price polypropylene cotton , upgrade leather . It 's frills . It n't feel like quality leather . The construction pretty basic . It good value though . It seem like deal wear tear . 
141	Bought project Telecaster . Delivered promptly excellent shape . Case fits well finished nice , Hard find better case low price ! . I know budget guitars n't come cases , even gig bag anymore . That 's trade-off I guess internet age order keep costs . Even Fender Standard Telecaster came sans-case I coax salesperson throw gig-bag incentive even back day . I looked guitar gear long I n't think guitar cases I got itch get new six-string came across . They look great , seem well built ( I professional touring musician ) apparently exterior covered black tolex , like pricey case , gold stitching plush interior really make case seem worth much asking price . The storage compartment adequately sized 's simple lock would functional safety measure ensure stays latched . There brass feet bottom along edge keep level prevent damage case . It fits Tele Fender Deluxe Stratocaster Maple Neck , Pearl White I suspect fine job protecting them.I picking tweed version Telecaster match style , lovely Fender amp . Like I stated , 's longer excuse good guitar case . This better gig bag , sure , looks like could hold pretty much standard sized solid body electric . Now , 's padded really well n't look like 'll hold years , cheap . It seems slightly hinges requires get lid closed properly , I drop star . I bought use squire strat . It also fit tele . A real good quality case protect axe damage carrying gig gig . This inexpensive money , well built case . I n't complaints . My Fender Strat fits snugly lined case n't durable case ( I would n't use ship guitar ) strong enough hauling guitar one place next . I 've bought three - awesome , well made case fits superstrat guitar easily . The recent something rather unique ( fret , compound scale eight string ) guitar also fit perfectly plenty room spare.There expensive options , `` '' case , best bang buck hands . I comfortable using carry guitars , inexpensive ones high end customs . Great case , great price . 
142	theres snark , blackout boss tu-2 pedals , rack option . pre-amp unit tuner love tuning stage something . got least 3 around , use bass guitar ( tune low drop f even picks bass ) The tuner great - seems accurate senses notes ease . complaint little back , n't hold angle find usable . otherwise ? fine product expect last years . korg makes great tuners . also pitchblack pitchblack plus . three ever lost stolen , 'd replace heartbeat exactly models .

Do n't get wrong tuner works great makes tuning E flat much easier non Chromatic tuner 's ALL I use . I prefer older tuners light , This screen really dim 's back light . My guitar room n't super bright 's difficult read.Guess 's price cheap . I sent grown daughter birthday pleased product . I three tuners I find Korg portable , easy use easy read . Battery life appears adequate . Oh , forget ... accurate . Shipping faster advertised . A `` thumbs one '' . Amazon comes price product . My criticism size screen readout reallysmall bit hard old blind man like see . I 've owned several inexpensive Korg tuners years . Like others , one excellent , reliable durable . I keep one bass guitar gig bag tune gigs . This tuner works fine flute clarinet however things use input jack n't really work . As soon I insert cord jack goes low B flat stays ... Even guitar bass end . At first I thought cord however four cords , I also tried tuners cords worked fine . So works good sound input poorly cord input . 
143	I use tube amp vocal . For price , I drive 2 mics , fit space . The tube sound good enough live performance long I n't crank much , also helps gain SM58 's much lower Line6 mic . I used multiple Studio Projects ART Tube tubes seem died due old age , I mainly cared tube feature , stepping MIC2200 fine me.If want get warmer vocal sound , n't want invest much , MIC2200 way go , imo . However , buying Behringer products always require crossing fingers ( hope last ) . So I 'll update I encounter problems . This wonderful product price ! Ive used tube preamps cause terrible humming low input gain . A little difficult set properly , running eq separate , adjust input output . I dont care much tube display led lights behind , n't bother either . Behringer makes great products prices . I use microphone preamp AKG Perception 220 microphone . There 2 ins 2 outs , 1 unbalanced channel . I expert studio equipment review personal position . I run direct digital recorder . I get good clean sound vocals . Still early give reliabilty flexability unit . The unit 2 channels , rack mounts sturdy , sure tube yet . New Behringer product line , far I like explore potential . 5 stars price , quality , features , amazon . I like preamp . I use one channel microphone electric guitar good results.Is sadly spendthrift useful life duration tube , another concept producci & oacute ; n nothing considered consumer planet . Do n't like 's difficult change tube . Sound quality I expected , maybe I n't familiar settings . No power cord included mine manual . Manual include sure cord . Dials small . My much better . I ca n't say 's bad . Just better choices opinion . I operate alternative broadcast studio , create music related content broadcast internet . We needed stand-alone microphone preamps searching internet I decided give Behringer unit try.This single rack space unit provides two independent microphone preamps , equipped single band sweepable parametric equalization adjust timbre final output . Before I even tried piece preamp I opened look NOT TO THE tube mounted way probably impossible change different preamps sound good stock tube . There schematic provided 's really impossible say tube implemented circuit much actually contributes tone unit.HOW DOES IT preamps sound good , full , rich , crisp highs , deep lows , 's function microphone connect far I tell . For comparison I compared preamp expensive API preamp unit paid $ 500 per preamp-channel , price per channel Behringer unit . I 'm going say Behringer beat API dead heat listening tests . My female partner technical ( great ears ) thought Behringer good API . We also Grace another $ preamp , definitely liked Behringer sound better Grace ( personally I think EQ Behringer affected choice comparing Grace ) .If API Grace preamps go toast I definitely repaired . If Behringer dies , 's going trash I 'll buy another one . It 's simple $ 100 two preamps sound good really nice . They sound good . They industry standard packaging . The input output connectors excellent . It even line input mode add little tube distortion signal ( I tried n't need ) broadcast three ten , live shows per week using preamp vocals . listening audience ever complained none know switched high-end pieces inexpensive preamp . Now expensive preamps back production studio used recording tracks play behind live performances shows.RELIABILITYWe problems unit . It warmed hour broadcast , I 've never heard noise bad stuff come . We A LOT Behringer gear studio , lives right along side gear , API , Allen Heath , , , Lexicon Apogee . Out 103 pieces Behringer equipment I 've bought 've two pieces problems occurred right box . I much worse reliability Crown amplifiers Behringer products I really like Crown amps , regardless problems , sound good . In experience Behringer products provided professional results amazing low price . That 's win-win book . 
144	I 've never much effect pedal guy ; lots batteries cables I get good tone direct Fender tweed . I 've recently using effects gone , quite frankly , hog wild new gear . This best pedal purchases I made far , 's quite MXR sound I going 's definitely something . The boost works well lead work really ups sustain two controls , one volume , one compression . My concern knobs feel like could much sturdy , I n't pulled yet I would guess pots plastic posts opposed metal ones . Well 's made nicely , output strong , sensitivity brings notes together , bright side 's little sustain , 'm going work , 's compressor 's . I purchased compressor pedal kind whim . I looking nicer ones , decided give go $ 20 . It came mail today , surprised packaging . Very little instructions DOES NOT ship 9 volt battery , putting one kind pain change , get philips screwdriver unscrew 4 corner screws back . ( wish plastic back , thumb screw option ) This pedal really quiet , good way.Do n't expect boost signal level , knob way sensitivity way , volume original signal , little seem tone sucker noise . Most compressors add little noise hiss , due nature raising noise also treble cut going . even sensitivity knob way , kills low end . It quite bright sounding.With said , works wonders single string/double stop stuff already trebley stuff played G , B , E strings , makes sound tight seem quite durable , The case n't made cheap plastic , good thing.Though rugged pedals I would own.The switch inputs seem little cheap though , granted $ 20 pedal.I feel using pedal tour might bad idea , however could see lasting while.The LED really bright . Almost bright , 're looking adjust controls , makes somewhat hard see 're , 're looking cheap compressor boost treble strings give em extra punch , may pedal , especially $ 're looking warm full bodied compressor , choice . You really wait get MXR Dyna Comp bucks . This EXACTLY I needed 3rd compressor I bought . I use vocals drops bass little super quiet mid range bump . So happy I got ( I got used one perfect condition bonus ) Behringer rules ! I use several Behringer components set-up ( e.g. , mixer , PA Speakers , effects , accessories , etc . ) including pedal . I confidence Behringer name always feel like I 'm getting good solid piece equipment I rely . This pedal exception - 's sturdily built effects pedal give exactly looking compressor pedal . I n't like depend battery power critical components I n't I also purchased Behringer Power Supply General DC 9V Power Adaptor available Amazon along . Great price , sturdily built , great compressor effect ! ! ! For years I lugging around large rack case Mackie board host rack effects ( reverb , delay , compressors etc. ) . While using rack I line programmable guitar effects pedal ( Boss ) went rack compressor little Vox amp ( internal compressor Boss pedal terrible ) . I happy set 10 years year ago I stopped using rack ( smaller clubs places many stairs ) . Since I went smaller PA ( Soundcraft active Mackie speakers ) started using terrible compressor otherwise decent Boss pedal . A months ago I took old box effects pedals built small pedal board . This worked great I could n't locate old Ibanez compressor years ago I know gave away MXR . I needed compressor pedal new pedal board worked well like I found winner . This MXR clone Behringer seems work well better MXR much quieter . Some people mentioned slight bump upper mids compressed signal ( I agree ) 's hiss added noise I like sound . My main guitar mid 90 's Epiphone sounds great Behringer DC9 . I ca n't comment durability I n't long case metal everything feels solid . I n't crank compression much I leave pedal 90 % time control overall signal pedal board ( My pedals order : Ibanez TS9 , Ibanez Super Tube ( pedal made TS9 ) cheap chorus pedal , Ibanez DE7 delay Behringer DR600 Reverb . ) For $ compressor 's supposed . It 's two knob `` sqeezer '' like old MXR works . ( No need worry compression ratios , thresholds , release points attack settings ) . Two knobs : one set overall compression one adjust output volume . Great simple pedal clean sound.Update : I pedal 1 1/2 years . I notice one reviewer said bass sound dropped guitar signal pedal . I admit true . It 's huge drop bottom end tone noticeable . This pedal something I would use heavily , nice job compressing peaks overall range gives nice smooth sound . If looking guitar pedal `` sustain '' sound may want look pedals . This basic compressor true `` sustainer '' high levels probably make sound `` thin '' compression ratio gets higher . On hand stomp pedal compressors $ pretty much thing . My Alesis rack compressor knock punch signal high levels also . The sound clean 's best used little compression , huge amounts needed call `` sustainer '' . Try Behringer CS400 sustain . I Behringer pedals many good sounding price range , pedal stay 've spent $ 200+ pedals , I order try many pedals within effects range , I believe costly get , sound quality usually far would put pedal category . This 1st compressor pedal I think I really needed type pedal , price I thought I would give try ... WOW ! The Behringer DC9 Dynamics Compressor Pedal greatly enhances sounds every pedal pedal-board , plus I get volume control knob allows drop amp output level amp set . So I go quiet apartment late hours , 100 watt amp , 's I would say majority people absolutely love pedal . Not MXR n't get hopes . It however great compressor money useful many applications , I find using bass guitar great either . Let 's face , I 'm sure better compressors 3 4 times price brought amp light . Bright , crisp , clean , balanced sound reproduction . Got Danelectro wall wart . Worked great . The free shipping lighting fast I got I bargain . Get one ! 
145	After reading poor reviews goosenecks 19 & # 34 ; , I decided play safe couple 13 & # 34 ; gooseneck way , longer unit needed , I screw 2 together . This excellent piece hardware , stiff sturdy sag . Even I put 2 together come top guitar amp I could mic front , using SM 57 , gooseneck holds mic absolutely still.Great buy . I purchased 2 items use band guitarists . I disapointed I mounted Shure sm 58 mic found goose neck would stay erect . These made far loose flexible professional mics . They may work small light weight units needs totally unuseable . It would helpful include suggested weight goose neck would support sales description . I wasted money . Do n't waste . Perhaps viagra would helpful ; - ) excellent product super strong works great arrived excellent condition . This strong hard I use gooseneck position pop filter microphone . It also sturdy enough use microphone holder hold microphone place . So stiff . Nothing short five pound weight cause extension buckle . If sing use effects pedals instrument , ca n't rely good boom microphone stand every venue , get one throw gear . I glad I bought . It exactly described good price . Get . I got install podium . It perfect . The construction sturdy , always stays place . Get , need one . We added extension PA system . It 's nice quality range easily adjustable stops provided excellent ability short tall speakers I use myOn Stage Microphone 13-inch Gooseneck , long I want . Sometimes - rare occasions - I used extend length 13 '' model.The mic I mainly use aNady DM70 Drum Instrument Microphone , small , relatively light , works saxophones well drums cymbals . When I using mic alto tenor sax , I use anOn Stage MY550 Microphone Extension Attachment clamp pole regular microphone stand , attach gooseneck DM70 without using separate mic stand.Because bigger sibling versatile I keep size around , plus supply extra extension attachment bars . In situations savior set . I , though , anything larger DM70 DM80 ( slightly larger heavier ) , may hold mic place . Nice looking gooseneck , threads clean , fits well . However , gooseneck flexible hold mic ( Shure SM58 ) without collapsing . Better try another brand , spend buck two get better product . This arrived I tried use , turned male threads oddball metric size NOT fit standard , theads stripped fitting mike clip , I go somewhere else buy new gooseneck AND standard item , excuse making non-standard threads , NO excuse advertising standard ...

147	It great option , simply best . Monster knows quality . monster These cables sturdy sound clean . Using cheaply made cables could affect sound - loose top end . I use Monster mics ( XLR ) instrument cables ( 1/4 ) issues . Great product ... Highly recommended . Quality construction signal passing . We never problems Monster gold cables . , cables crap us periodically . These cables give pure sound unhindered uncut . I several `` good '' cables compared cut highs even level . I grown musician point I Know 's worth pay little quality cables . Yes get many cables way cheaper ( I 'm getting things good price - publishers clearing house Not visited yet ! ) case get pay ! For thia best cables mean give original natural tone ur instrument , doesnt lose signal strenth important thing , help avoid : ) Hands best cables electric guitar . Ive tried brands cost almost , similar none match quality prolink presents . These best delivering tone 're durable . I bought mine back 2004 're still working well day I got today September 2012 . I bought cables $ 40 n't even last 2 years . I would def recommend anyone electric . If going playing acoustic I would get specific acoustic cable . This heavy guage . Sounds great ! My review par others concerning quality cable compared cheaper ones . I bought locally happy using bass guitars . The cable solid definately seems hold weeks heavy usage.One complaint I right angle lock jack bass securely , works others flawlessly . I use jazz bass time issues.I also use Spectraflex fatso flex cables Mogami think one worth 's price . To , warranty worth price . I reead web opinions monster 's marketing techniques written musicians see points price build quality , expensive cables made Mogami countless others better one opinion . This definitely high quality cable . However , experience model less Standard 100 Instrument Cable 21 ft. - straight 1/4 plugs shown difference one `` prettier '' gold colored , fittings . I found - ears anyway.As see tag review Amazon verified I purchased cable ( well Amazon verifying purchase less pricey model review product page . ) I initially purchased pair cables keyboards I invested significant sum instruments wanted nothing best cables . I purchased standard cables low end instruments including old Squier Jazz Bass new , LP Special II Les Paul Electric Guitar , Vintage Sunburst , neither mind warranted top line surprise , I started testing cable instrument ( amp keep things equal ) , I could discern sonic difference Monster cable models . Same manufacturer , different models . To sure , expensive model looked `` cooler '' , came sound - discernible difference ( I could detect anyway . ) More perplexing molded stress relief ends less expensive model seem make one reliable ! My recommendation test one standard model side-by-side plunking extra money added value beyond looks ( , I admit , may selling point stage folks - shame long know paying extra . ) Very well made . No problems . Should able stand use abuse . Really nice cable ! I 've mine year . And worked flawlessly . No problems distortion noise . Build quality solid come . Nice gold tips polished finish great connectivity ! Keep professional . And become Monster ! I ! I n't issue cable yet , guage wire connecting plugs thick high quality , takes stop coiling . Like title says , timeless combo Neutrik & Mogami better . If 're wondering get cables cheap , make . It saves much money !

151	This thing simple set nice warm tone I like clean delays . I also got TC electronics repeater options , tap tempo stereo , I use one distorted delays . They great pedals I use time . Ok I replaced Boss DD3 pedal boss digital pedal I left board I wanted complete analog board . This pedal subtle Boss want delay fatten lead tones retain sound amp look . MXR far better Boss IMHO I love DD3 . This excellent choice 're looking nice analog delay small looks great , 's easy use , 's fantastic size delay pedal.The analog delay nice warm -- much satisfying digital delay ears . Also , modulation button enables add chorusing effect internal adjustment I n't think I need use anyway.I highly recommend ! This hands best delay pedal I ever used . I owned Boss DD-3 many years I tried various brands , little beauty takes cake . The delay pure analog produces smooth creamy sound . It easy ears clean distorted settings , adds exponentially tone . When turned true bypass , means color guitar 's natural tone way . I recognized notable difference I unhooked DD-3 plugged Carbon pedal slightly smaller pedals built like tank . The price point little expensive , instance , get pay . If 're looking creamy , true bypass , analog pedal look . The Carbon Copy best ! This super warm get trippy . I like depth adds everything subtle , extreme whatever else , mod switch great flutter effect , nice extra . 600 milliseconds really enough I tape type unit something like 2.5 seconds , enough . I like retro , I used show day I got noticed . I say MXR really stepped stuff , musical pedal . Again , Youtube homework listen around 'll come conclusion . Amazon great deal . I LOT pedals ... . including many delays echos ... The MXR little organic warm tone response Aqua Puss , EH Memory Boy , Ibanez , Boss , lets even get Behringer stuff ... : ) I like chorus-like mod button . Very lush sweet listen . Not feature rich delays , tad appealing ear others . Simple use , compact well built . I like using clean ... even 's ability take distortion pretty good.This simliar favorite echo ( 70 's ) real warm surrounding sound . right word.Hope helps . The reverb broke amp I tried Boss FRV-1 replace n't really like much . Then I read darker analog delay sort sound reverby . This exactly I wanted . It fills sound yet n't add artificial high end . Sounds gorgeous I , playing alone basement . For songs 's always , really excels vintagy-sounding stuff like Surf . The mod button nice add-on I n't really bonded yet.If I buy I might consider Aqua Puss I n't use high delay times much Aqua Puss easy access battery door . While I 've never big delay guy , I 've always felt pedal board missing particular effect . I 'm definitely fan digital delay , I lot R & D ; analog delays hopes find right one basically three options delays $ 200 : MXR Carbon Copy , EHX Memory Boy , Malekko Ekko . I realize pedals , according research best three price.The Memory Boy seemed good concern lot exaggerated modulation , something I interesting . Crazy effects EHX trademark 're looking sort thing Memory Boy might alley . I read nothing good things Malekko Ekko tossed back forth Carbon Copy ultimately went Carbon Copy I able find first-hand reviews it.I n't regret decision , pedal sounds great . The repeats long sound artificial . Some people complain repeats dark I n't think people understand difference analog digital delay . If 're looking recreate The Edge sound , analog delay you.I 'm able create types sounds pedal thickening rhythm track , slapstick , repeats solos . I love . Sometimes I leave pedal mix knob dialed subtle ambience tone.One minor criticism modulation effect subtile , least . There internal trimpots make effect pronounced I yet mess . I would rather controls knobs pedal . Love pedal . The Mod button makes sound like tremolo I great classic Fender tremolo amp I use I n't use option much . I use I want little slap-back works great provides real nice analog tone . This great effect . I happy . Awesome engineering Jim Dunlop 's MXR products always presented . The true bypass feature high-end quality materials make reliable dependable . This delay device ( humble opinion ) probably best delay . It sensitive delivers , delay rate 0 600 miliseconds . Most units offer max around 400 mark normally quite large size take lot space pedal boards . This pedal another little pedal board deliver . I actually sure exceed expectations . Ships fast . Highly recommended . One great surprises last couple years MXR Carbon Copy delay pedal . Designed Way Huge , great analog delay $ . Using bucket circuitry , true bypass simple 3 knob interface , Carbon Copy flexible unit . `` modulation '' switch , achieve slight chorusing sound ( like flutter old tape echoes ) adjusted via internal trim pot.The unit small footprint ( like MXR pedals ) pedal board truly great sounding delay try one What I say ? First 's MXR ... enough said . This company ( Dunlop ) gets right MXR line . I Boss guy never really happy delay chorus . I n't hate Boss use chain . I already MXR Dyna Comp & Phaser 90 pedal I took leap bought delay . Wow ! It 's much warmer Boss . Side side MXR hands ... well least . It goes slap-back space shot easily ... It 's great pedal may well replace much reverb use ... I 'm really happy would replace god forbid ... This pedal really hits spot ! Warm vintage analog slap-back delay optional modulation ability self ( , fan Johnny Greenwood , love ! ) . I also use give guitar sort ambient sound , modulation short delay time , sounds almost like phaser . This great analog delay , analog meaning 're gon na get lot crazy sounds delays last forever . If 're looking get creative lots weird sounds , get Boss Digital Delay . This pedal intended color tone little bit spectacular way . I 'm pleased . Warm analog delay natural sound , sterile ez use , harsh digital BS , I like way better BOSS . Plus MXR built like tank last lifetime I alot MXR pedals one one favorites . This one top delay pedals pro 's use . It super simple use , many repeats want , Delay long want delay Mix basically loud want delay mix . You get great delays one pedal . From n't ' Love , Randy Rhoads solos 80 's . There also little MOD button seems add depth pedal , really makes seem bit fuller . I like feature alot . pedal worked well , I sent back thru marshall lot line noise I like , cool ! ! ! ! This warm analog delay great deal range . Its warm modulation sounds great . This digital delay echos exactly play , get analog delay , hear part little left . Get , tank tough endless hours fun . I n't problems pedal , price I would go Way Huge Aqua Puss analog delay . It 's Tube Screamer delay pedals . I use mine primarily thicken tone , definitely would miss board . I used situations call deep delay , love mod function get pretty spacey ... I fall back EHX Memory Man chained sick ping pong 2 delays experimentation sequences , playing blues thrash , I use tone beef . Low settings , like bass 'd reverb.There literally million different ways use pedal , testament 's versatility pops many pedal boards many different - stop reading order ! Now ! ! ! ! The MXR Carbon Copy Analog Delay relative pedal scene , become instantly beloved professional , semi-professional , amateur guitarists alike ( I would latter category ) . As longtime user Boss DD-3 Digital Delay , bit jarring trying Carbon Copy . But playing controls bit appreciating pure quality tone produces , quickly n't great way explain difference digital analog delay say former precise percussive , latter provides warmth ambience . The `` Mod '' button suppose add additional modulation tone , though I n't hear dramatic difference . But matter setting use , something undeniably `` real '' delay effect Carbon Copy versus delays I used . Rather repeat notes verbatim , almost sounds like middle ground reverb/echo effect large hall digital range delay , fortunately , quite wide . I believe goes 20 600 milliseconds . To give perspective , slapback delays ( rockabilly `` Cats '' echo ) short , probably 150 milliseconds . `` U2 '' delays usually around ms. Then 's even longer delays lot repeats , la Pink Floyd 's David Gilmour . This pedal capable ( though `` U2 '' style delay better achieved digital ) . One note though - whereas DD-3 uses three different knob range settings cover delay time , everything ms covered one sweep Carbon Copy 's knob . This makes convenient , also bit touchy.To summarize , Carbon Copy outstanding alternative digital delay attractive price point . It covers sounds delay pedals twice large ( expensive ) , belongs delay aficionado 's pedalboard . This great pedal , well made fairly compact fit pretty well small pedal board . I also like tone lot . Bear mind I like vintage tones , 's crisp , crystal clear tone like 'd get digital delay , 's got warmth.There 's great video YT proguitarshop.com demos well . It 's got great short long delay , smooth feel mod switch adds right amount modulation tone make tad fuller . This bright sounding delay , tad dark times 're careful.I use long delay sounds use another delay short , slap back echo sounds , 's Mooer . They work well together get huge , fuller , ambient type sound going . I put Mooer MXR chain . I use pedals right front amp 's effects hope helps decision . If like warm , old school tones 'll dig pedal . I already pedal , needed add little delay two separate channels ( stereo ) . I liked delay much , rather buy stereo delay , I bought another MXR Carbon Copy ! Just recently months back got first tube amp , wanted good analog delay pedal go I found digital delay pedals left something desired least lot research reading reviews I decided give Pedal try.All I say wow ! It excellent sound quality , low noise transparent petal chain.The settings outstanding , disappointed well-made . This unit produce warm vintage sound analog delay . It 's & # 34 ; digital bright & # 34 ; delay like Boss DD3 . Mod switch adds perfect & # 34 ; chorus & # 34 ; effect 80 's Metal sound . 
152	This came today I must say surpassed expectations greatly . My Takamine acoustic/electric fits perfectly VERY stand . I 100 % confidence NEVER tip . You 'd total klutz knock thing . Anyone less 4 5 stars must paid shill.This built like tank last lifetime . It adjustable ( neck ) fully padded , two-arm base piece swivels custom fit . The stand takes 30 seconds assemble folds easy transport . It 's stand , 's supposed ? That said , I try use stands extremely unreliable . I use put instrument short time . These far better made ones I 've found without contraption & # 34 ; lock & # 34 ; instrument give false sense security . These made near used 20 years ago , negative way , piping gotten better old stuff used scuff deteriorate really quickly . I 'd prefer better stand , however , I question 's . This OnStage `` Heavy Duty Guitar Stand '' exactly looking hold son 's acoustic guitar . Here observations : + Easy Setup ; takes seconds+ Sturdy ; free standing design works well+ Neck ; adds degree protection great basic stand works exactly like hoped ! Highly Recommended ! CFH Excellent value money although heavy duty stands I . Nice stable classical guitar . This good stand . I 've stands tubular construction price range , one definitely much sturdier . It fits every guitar I 've put fine , holds rather steady even without fastening clumsy band across neck . If ever tempted lean guitar something , owe instrument pick one . Using PRS electric guitar satisfactory results . Easy set . Sturdy enough repeated use . No worries using expensive instrument . Simply put , 's well made works great . This stand inexpensive I thought I could save bit money give try use Epi Sheraton II . Unfortunately I comfortable trusting guitar stand . It seems built well enough , seems quite unbalanced always verge tipping backwards . Also , left/right stability need set guitar bottom support piece seems construction ' . The rubber tips feet seem fine , front legs seem overly long rear foot overly short . The body cradle nicely padded n't firmly seated inside center tube even though rudimentary locking design , n't solid . You adjust height inserting top piece bottom caused deep scratches black paint top tube piece . It ships unsightly white UPC sticker must tediously removed want look good , Sheraton II large heavy guitar OnStage `` Heavy Duty '' means SOLID , stand n't , least larger guitars basses . When use guitar stand ca n't afford dealing something least bit temperamental risk damaging instrument possibly even line , get pay . For smaller , lighter guitars , Strats , may ok , Dots , , 335 's larger Gretch 's , I would n't trust goes basses well.I need look something else . I gone lot stands one money Great . As matter fact , I ordered 2 . Get one No ... ... .. This stand purchased replace older bass guitar stand - weak falling apart . I heavy duty stand one perfect . 
153	These cables work perfect connecting mixer amp . Not long , short . Just I needed . works , got time . I happy It connected well nady smps-x1 phantom power unit I bought ! I 'll update I hook ! Check ! I use cables go balanced outputs digital piano ( I pro model XLR outs ) inputs studio monitors audio interfaces . Works every time . Balanced signal much better ... issues ground loops problems . Just clear cheap build quality fine . What makes good cable ? One works . I 've XLR cables fail pins get loose , I hope n't happen one .

Nice cord , sturdy build , good sound . go n't leak 's perfect guess . It 's working ok , hard useI use PC table karaoke phantom mic 's well done . I originally bought several cables use light . The day arrived I happened need six foot cord live mic stand I tried one . The cable soft flexible I could tell difference sound custom cable I using ( 's good thing , cable expensive ) .The connectors gold plated 's inexpensive cable , 's pretending anything decent low-cost XLR two-conductor shielded cable . It 's working , I 'll buying studio . Good quality , well made . Its simple cable , said . It good deal , job . I use home recording great needs . I recommend anyone records home . Often , get pay . After researching various pieces sound equipment weeks weeks , I chose solid items reasonable prices.I 've known better skimp critical piece puzzle - quality cable . This item simply n't ever work - arrived bent pen one end , even attempted straighten , n't connect well onto mixer board . The microphone end VERY shaky connection intermittent power n't buy item - spend relatively small extra amount get reliable brand . These cables seem quality-made . I purchased go two microphones ( also Amazon order ) .I yet try microphone . Got I thought length would enough . It , I wanted mobility went longer length . Had problems cable though . Works great !

154	I 've playing bands since 1969 used every wireless ever invented beats , hands ! So heres thing one else wants say . The thing built like piece s*** . It rattles parts always moving around . I used 3 times shorted . The lights started flashing got hot . I called line 6 determined bad opened `` ticket '' . FYI want deal worst customer service industry call line 6 . Not know talking I could hear joking like big party going . I wish I would never bought hopefully I get new one soon . Well see helpful really . I always loved line 6 . This product sounded great hour total gave . It went dead . I changed channels worked like minute went dead . I sorry say I returned . My AKG wireless guitar bug lasted years drop really disappointed . I love freedom G30 gives . I 'm real klutz cords ... especially ML designed guitars . So I figured product would actually end saving money . The sound lot , . Between & Bill humbuckers sound unforgiving mistakes come real clear ... making work technique become better player.I took star I n't like prospect slave Duracell .

157	I tried many types steel strings . My Taylor came delivered - though I tried several others , I returned . Their ease play ( smoothness fret finger ) light rich tonality makes good choice 12-string . Have n't tried 'em yet ? Pick set - ARE different , many ways , better standard Phosphor Bronze strings best came along . I Guitars Jumbo 12 String Acoustic Electric came strings . 12 string guitars generally hard play long periods time , might get much use regular 6 string . The tone strings bright clear 8 months later , still hold tuning like first 2 days . Elixir strings general expensive major brands - extra bucks worth sounds stays clear consistent extensive use . They great strings guitar . Changing strings 12 string less often ? Fantastic ! ! And sound good . I n't expect much volume light strings . The tone strings lasts 4 months , experience , depend much playing get . WOW , putting mildly quality sound strings produce 12 string.Endless beauty tones produced Elixer . Elixer strings expensive strings well worth higher price tag . You go go set two Elixers . These strings great 12 string . I started using coated strings guitars last year gotten use smooth feel . A 12 string little harder fingers coating nice . They sound bright clean uncoated string I used guitar . And I think last longer . Which nice guitar really much fun restring !

When 's opened way , relatively stable , suitable servicing guitar . As others say , fold nicely , takes minimal space toolbox . I would n't use I made living servicing guitars , I n't think would last long due quality materials ( feel pretty cheap . ) But work well enough individual work guitars while.I imagine one could make something bit sturdy less wood felt .

162	Works buy Just got week . Looks nice works intended . For 22 bucks , ca n't really go wrong . I use Behringer C1 trouble getting fit . It 's bit snug , I would prefer snug fit loose fit . I really wanted great product . The screws strip easily . Basically , put microphone , ever use microphone , going strip . I two hoping first one lemon . Nope . Even pop filter fell . I LOVE design , need make strong enough handle weight microphone strong enough handle regular studio usage ... : adjusting position mic , picking mic stand moving , etc . Otherwise , n't adjustable tilt option . Just make one solid piece . I 'm tempted try fix Gorilla Glue I love design . It 's strong enough . Not 's surprise though . Not much anything worth money days . It 's damn chore return every friggin ' purchase days n't really care actually testing products . Why ? They already money . I feel like I get paid testing products time spent un-boxing packing things back . Besides , going ? Replace another broke $ $ product ? Better yet , refund money product I paid - minus shipping ? ? ? ? That n't include time I spent trying prevent buying one testing damn product first place . I want refund , plus wage . Whatever , n't buy one . Companies n't test products n't deserve business . What would make happy , one companies make products answer question ( ) : Did test product ? How test ? What results ? Is ready sold public confidence ? Nope Great mount price . Filter attached mount great idea , saves space simplifies mic stand setup . Quality good , especially given fairly low price . I 'm loving pop filter ! It looks professional design , feels sturdy mic stand . The built shock mount definitely plus . I like beginners try grab mic studio recording vocals . This immediately let 's know speak microphone . Also offers option removing pop screen want . Amazon great conjunction seller ! My item arrived lightning fast ! Amazon like music ears , 's products studio . Simply THE BOMB ! ! ! ! ! I got build Pop Screen . However I found attached one place . This ok using full boom & # 8217 ; facing singer .

164	In opinion , best guitar volume pedal available . It affordable exactly 's supposed , , well I might add . I 've tried numerous volume pedals , Morley Line 6 Dunlop DVP1 , none fluid feel good Ernie Ball owned Dunlop DVP1 several months , okay job cutting volume I simply like feel low volume levels . It felt way bulky foot went 0 3 barely applying volume . This unacceptable 're trying clean distortion channel trying accomplish slow volume swell . But soon I laid Ernie Ball plugged I fell love . Not feel great foot provide precise control , complete volume sweep . Add delay give swell . Absolutely perfect ! I 've heard people complain Ernie Ball Jr flimsy pedal I n't see . Of course , 's tank like Dunlop Morley , still feels solid . It 's also lighter others mentioned , plus traveling musicians.I would HIGHLY recommend pedal . It one favorites board I could n't imagine playing without ! Works smoothly , built like tank looks good well . I 've tried passive volume pedals n't work ... one works . Worth every penny . If want swells instrument , make notes & # 34 ; cry & # 34 ; , ' trick . Smooth , reliable action noise . I needed volume pedal smaller stature pedal case one fits bill ... AND ... 's heavy duty , accurate real smooth fall . If plan use pedal traditional volume pedal Guitar > Volume Pedal > Amp configuration ( inserting effects pedals anywhere like ) , engineered pedal . It ca n't `` true bypass '' long signal travels potentiometer use pots virtual short adjusted properly pedal , difference plugging guitar directly amp placing pedal chain amp immediately noticeable . The tone becomes duller , output drops . I would expect Asian knock-off , gear maker . I might Ernie Ball 's reputation , though make fine guitars I got ta say , I 've used strings many years.If plan use pedal digital effects fine . This digital device take two measurements pure resistance either end rocker . The signal processing takes place unit , pedal . ( Those units tone problems 's another review . ) It occur pedal buffer ( NOT `` true bypass '' words ) may fix problem , likely related impedance , like tuner pedal , guitar volume pedal . I need try , excuse Ernie Ball responsibility . Major stars generous EB fails simple `` first harm '' principle . It tone . How dumb ? The pedal attractive , appears indestructible , though I doubts `` string '' mechanism time . The rocker feels smooth weight gives pedal stability floor.I recommendations volume pedal . Because feel , , I plan keep digital device use , wish able promises , fails miserably , deliver . There way kind rig complete without least one . I several . Came perfect working condition . Great Buy . I recommend pedal anyone considering volume pedal . It super sturdy , transparent I fully expect long time . The tuner nice feature , serious selling point quality . Go volume pedal needs . 
165	Most comfortable picks - complaint I would like four pack . If use four fingers buy two sets ... I 'm used conventional steel finger picks . These actually work really well long n't play hard , like I sometimes picks . Playing hard really hurts exposed finger pads ordinarily covered regular picks . However , allow better touch expression playing softly . Sounds like great concept seem well made . I n't care . I know others love I guess 's personal thing.It took weeks receive US . Do n't rush . I love open feel picks . It 's almost like picking fingers , except volume . I decided try open metal finger picks I could longer find ProPicks , I really like . open metal pick users probably think look familiar . Compared ProPicks manufacturer heavier , stiffer metal . They offer user advantage conventional plastic metal finger picks actually feel string fleshy part finger . I find ( ProPicks , matter ) much natural conventional picks . These actually advantages old ProPicks : ( 1 ) get three finger picks , rather two ; ( 2 ) metal heavy gauge , seem less likely bend playing fall fingers . It would nice see packaged little plastic container 're protected guitar case ; however , heavy duty probably survive quite well around case . Highly recommended fingerpicking acoustic guitar resonator guitar . Do n't know delay took forever get . The picks look like work although little hard bend , see 's I looking , thanks ! Bought normal finger picks working . I grew playing without picks playing transition wearing picks going well . I wear either outside inside nail . These working lot better . I play fingernails ca n't control standard metal fingerpicks I ca n't feel strings . I used picks years , good . These better . They give control nails , yet tone protection metal - I feel strings ! , harmonics , everything ... If play nails want finger picks , . 
166	I actually replaced BOSS pedal . Does everything supposed without `` perceived '' ( 's say ) volume loss typical many tremolo pedals . If 's perceived , explain good sounds ? I since pedal rehoused metal enclosure better switch I scared breaking plastic housing switching . Let start saying I huge fan Dano stomp boxes . I probably close dozen various lines make . This pedal decent job covering tremolo needs , IMHO tremolo Dano 's Cool Cat line much durable pedal $ 4 ( time review ) . The switches knobs pedal weak link . I n't think 's true bypass either . The Cool Cat metal enclosure , true bypass , sturdier inputs knobs , much better on/off switch . The features sound . Spend extra $ 4 much bullet-proof pedal Cool Cat trem . Hey , gets job done 's I ask . I tried several `` cheapo '' pedals , one favorite . While better casings ( metal instead plastic ) , end day I 'm looking good sound , pretty pedal board . The pedal seems solid enough , n't take much space , sounds great , versatile range sounds far tremolo pedals , like typical musician , looking something 's going break bank . When I first started setting little studio , I wanted something n't break budget . I tried couple different combo pedal boards , ( Digitech 500 , Boss ME-70 ) , quickly realized I n't getting sound money quickly drying . With much left , I tried Tuna Melt example Danelectro . Who would think ? This thing stunning ability manufacture vintage tremolo sounds , line pedals . I types , never dissapointed save 's hard chain without lot noise.Then I got guitar building , got put away . Lately , I trying make time improve playing skills , joy ! I rediscovering pedals I absolutely love them.Forget FAB series , hot . Buy old style Tuna Melt , big metal ones like Dan Echo . You NOT sorry ! Hello Musicfriends - This built cheap sounds great . Good controls . For studio/songwriting perfect I would exactly go tour ... .. There something knobs I still love , even digital units tremolo hidden ... may age thing ... sounds great . nice warm lush . one better trems 've pleasure use . however , hate plastic housing , input/output jacks located . I n't heavy feet , probably last good long board , really would n't want put much weight . 
167	I love able adjust tension . Does go sharp like capos really clamp wish easy way keep handy guitar . I know many people love design , I find much frustrating . You careful putting fret correctly , snap , turn turn screw , oops n't let snap fall trying turn screw . Then go whole routine take move another fret put . What . This worst capo I 've owned , I 've tried nearly every brand type . Yeah , I 've people show right , I know right . It 's wrong spend much time slipping , snapping , screwing , screwing , fall , forget , 's garbage . Also , I 'm getting callouses worked playing two hours every day , last thing I want pinch fingers metal trying turn screw . It 's actually slightly painful fingers ( , deal ? ? ) work . This design seems like non guitar player came . The good thing I say looks thanks . If familiar Shubb 's , far best capo get . Some people like big close pin , n't , buy Shubb Simple , compact , well constructed , easy use , sounds good ; things would look capo.This original Shubb capo , designed acoustic guitars metal strings . The Shubb website describes huge range specific capos make , specialized use . The C1 probably universal models . This fits Les Paul Traditional 08 ( Gibson Les Paul Traditional Plus Electric Guitar , Heritage Cherry Sunburst ) , SE Custom 22 Guitar , Grey Black Tremolo Bridge , LP Special II Les Paul Electric Guitar , Vintage . The primary use Laguna simple instruction card included capo adjust tension . It 's key get much tension.We 've trouble figuring park capo . Mostly goes pocket . Once capo adjusted fit neck , n't clamp tight headstock . Not huge deal , consideration . This best capo I 've ever owned . It 's little awkward n't clip headstock one hand , takes two hands also put , retune 12-string makes worthwhile ! I like choice colors . Some folk n't like sometimes come knocked ; I like ; them.They n't squeeze strings tight importantly ; look cool . around highly recommended capo result Shubb . This capo easily adjustable slide like spring types , 's great capo durable construction material . Like good guitar well cared , something 's great hand next click YES review helpful , encourage continue writing updating reviews , leave comment questions , I happy answer I help . I already owned stainless version capo roller instead plastic tip adjuster screw . I like one overall quality seems better , even though pricing similar I bought first one . And rivets one allow parts move sideways n't line right . But I put guitar seems line okay , 's important part . Easily best quality capo 's price . Looks great guitar . I came across months back , capo finally gave 12 years . I bought C1 stainless steel version capo made good transition several guitars , I adjust time I went use Les Paul 50s neck Amazon shipped day.I got mail yesterday , snapped right LP firm click . I n't even adjust . It looks amazing use ... best simplest know feel lock place staying matter . Do n't forget remove guitar resting . It 's easy forget 's . Forget oversized torture device style capos ... never effects fret thumb forefinger -- exactly I looking capo.I 2 long time , I 'm Shubb guy day forward . 
168	I purchased teach play keyboard instrument . This device delivered everything I wanted . This keyboard far exceeded expectations price - quality `` bread butter '' sounds high . This keyboard also tons neat features - 's something musicians skill level ( check Yamaha 's product blurb ) .To get idea good keyboard sound , search YPG-235 YouTube check `` trying Yamaha ypg 235 '' 's also 76 keys ( unweighted ) , MIDI ( USB ) compliant , portable even run batteries pinch , YPG-235 could used variety situations.One star couple - Other , around $ 200 , instrument steal . mind , `` negatives '' ( aside trying install USB MIDI ) Yamaha sells keyboard without AC adapter sustain pedal standard accessories , really need . Yamaha note lot people feel burned AC adapter . FOR THOSE TO USE THIS ON A 7 USB MIDI drivers instrument provided CD - disk I got contained drivers Windows Vista - I tried using driver WIN 7 system , n't work . The CD supply link take directly latest driver downloads , n't - I ran lot problems going route - I suggest bypass trying use link CD suggests go directly Yamaha website get latest driver . Much easier , YPG-235 works fine computer , still surprising since USB MIDI keyboards plug play . Okay works really neat price fantastic . A great addition serve well After played Yamaha 88-key Portable Grand Piano Keyboard showroom loving , I torn , wondering I would missing I went priced YPG-235 . I 235 appears I missing twelve keys . That , I experiencing even ounce buyer 's remorse opting cheaper 235 . This lovely keyboard beautiful voices I ever know extremely user friendly functionality . Of course , opinion taken grain salt I first admit experience products variety extremely limited . As , might best say , novice , one could ask better instrument price.So difference 235 535 ? Based previous comparative shopping , I come differences . First obvious fact 535 possesses 88 keys , 235 76 . The 535 also includes stand , sustain pedal , power adapter , must purchased separately 235 . While I unaware specifics , 535 also greater storage capacity capability well voices . Beyond differences , played models , 535 also wins regard aesthetics looks feels slightly higher quality , display apparent craftsmanship buy YPG-235 ? If price issue , go ahead get 535 , beautiful instrument . However , budget simply need 88 keys , purchase 235 . Like 535 , 235 possesses piano style Soft Touch ( ) keys , exactly weighted occupy perfect gap pure synth keys weighted . The feel perfect one used standard synth-style keyboard keys yet little control without sacrificing playability . The 235 , like 535 , also features USB connectivity general MIDI compatibility , well almost high quality voices , separate 535 235 many models price brackets ( besides , multitude stringed instrument voices amazingly realistic ) . While unfortunate Yamaha decided include power adapter 235 , theYamaha Kit D - Accessory Kit Yamaha YPG-235 & YPG-235 includes power adaptor , extended warranty , couple low quality extras purchased relatively cheaply . In opinion , YPG-235 offers buyer bang comparative buck . Again , 235 sounds great , feels great hard beat price ! This keyboard sounds good , inability go low E killing . The speakers good . Buy good sustain SP-2 Sustain Pedal Piano Style Action

170	Although light little pricey opinion , really gets job done . I like fact use batteries power light . The nine led 's really light music stand . The carrying case comes well made & & keeping stored . Joyner That 's I got ... I needed light without heat ! It works fine . Just sorry 's little pain keep taking battery I want use AC connection . Other , 's fine , pretty well constructed . Seems take bangs without problems ! I used Manhasset orchestra light , definitely improvement , distributes nice soft light evenly whole page , unlike Manhasset light tends rather uneven . It entire Regal Conductor 's Music well said , 40 bucks light , feels rather flimsy . In construction light brightness , compare well traditional clamp desk lights , usually much cheaper ( issue mainly light switch , jury clamp , though seems strong ) . Of course , orchestra light , could n't much brighter without intended purpose , I pointing I feel n't worth 40 dollars , consider whole field similar lights ( intended orchestra ) .I bought reputation reviews , probably cost closest competitor , theRechargeable Music Stand LED Light Clip-on 9 Adapter . That one negative issues light , much acceptable $ plus free shipping.One thing , ignore `` Frequently Bought '' suggestion get theMighty Bright Bright Light light . I bought , confirm totally , anyways , light huge clamp used carefully balance light desk without clamping , desired . Nice bright light . I might bright twin lights , used 4 years . As many things , I 'm little older need little light read sheet music . This light comes nice soft case ( though call bag ) holds everything . The switch conveniently located top light . The clamp well constructed less likely move ... unlike twin lights . Let start saying go wrong buying series Mighty Bright music stand lamps . The Orchestra lamp particular fantastic product . It provides plenty smooth , even light sleek design . And carrying case makes portable . Fits best flat metal , tight clamp . I portable stand flat metal base ... I used sturdy piece foam board clamp ... works great . The unit uses three AA batteries . I started using 3 batteries work light drops within four hours . I prefer use 13 foot adapter cord . I older person old eyes . Sometimes lower C lower A look alike . Mighty Bright Orchestra Light rescue ! The clip also much larger image would let believe ; however , base curved allow music easily lay top.Some comments indicated plugging AC adapter base apparently disconnect batteries expected . The unit I purchased disconnect batteries upon insertion power cord clip . To confirm unit : ( 1 ) AC adapter wall light , ( 2 ) load batteries clip , turn light , finally ( 3 ) AC adapter STILL wall outlet , plug cable base . The light go . If n't , unit isolating batteries AC adapter , may present fire hazard batteries installed AC adapter plugged . I bought I gig dark bar . I used music stand lowest setting worked perfectly . For songs I three sheet paper ( overlapped inch ) light covered three pages easily dark spots . I ca n't imagine situation I would ever need use brighter setting . I thinking getting version , n't want risk covering three pages . The gig bag square softly padded . There lot dead space bag support empty areas corners I n't expect much protection light adapter . Treat light like bag 'll fine . They include 3 batteries ( I n't see I pulled adapter review ) get started using light , adapter works well long cord using adapter gig n't worry making power supply . I 've owned LED music stand lights years . This one puts shade ( pun intended ; sorry ) .The bar spreads light well wide fan pattern . The light desired area n't spread everywhere like lights . The little fin back light good keeping annoyance musicians 's pointed back music . The light two-level : normal BRIGHT ! Normal plenty good enough shows darkened theater . The fact light white rather yellow typical stand-light bulbs definite plus . If need put color filter , n't worry hot bulb melting holes filter . The light spread smooth consistent I n't waste time maneuvering heads find optimum light pattern like necessary two-head stand gooseneck reasonably stiff hold well . The included AC adapter much longer cord typical lights . The included zipper case fairly big bulky , squash much possible instrument case bag . It pocket inside upper part batteries , clip attachment light base elastic holders top light , small pocket AC adapter . It 's hard fit adapter cable back pocket , 's plenty room case . I n't know battery life yet , least include pack light like included AC adapter ( usually optional purchase ) .This light bit large compared LED stand lights , 's good I n't really care . I 've gotten years service Mighty Bright lights , I expect . Even one n't last , I 'll keep buying . Excellent stand light . Provides cool , bright , clean white light cover three four & # 34 ; must-have & # 34 ; play dimly-lit venues.Get !

173	Made leather high-quality pleather , seems . I use Seagull totally works great . I would definitely recommend , 's kind expensive . smart & handy design acoustic guitar n't drilled hole . 's easy buckle guitar strap neck & botton button guitar , ! I may misunderstood product description I prefer string tied end acoustic . My issue makes guitar really high I play standing position way adjust strap make longer . If play sitting lot would probably work . Do n't get wrong , nothing wrong product ; n't I thought . Nothing special . If n't like shoelace thing acoustic guitar strap , n't want bore hole heel , nice compromise . There slits ends leather , means reverse button n't want logo front guitar neck/headstock . You could even flip soft leather side exposed . I subtracted star I think button made metal instead plastic . Purchased use slotted headstock Martin n't fit well . Also found extremely difficult attach remove . A string style worked lot better , lot easier attach remove , provided lot options good placed . I bought Sigma , allows guitar hang better type headstock straps looks much better , leather high quality supple . For Martins , well , guitars without neck brace button , secure way connect strap . Forget leather shoe-string clipping comes straps , secure wo n't ever end loose ends first fret . Nothing tie untie , quick button connection 's needed . Just make sure choice strap long enough since distance neck greater guitar body . Does n't improve functionality , matching logo nice touch Martin Sigma guitars . I Martin D35 acoustic strapping string knot around neck honestly bit annoying - figure 's $ 10 investment going ? make things easier LOOKING - 's ! like really makes puting strap guitar much easier removing easy task.I bought martin strap match Martin Leather Guitar Strap - martin brand nut suppose ! Am totally pleased I drill guitar use strap ! Works great , get one ! ! ! The connection strap great enhancement fits wonderfully . Just one caution ... I noticed couple scratches neck near Headstock finally determined `` Button '' pressing neck case . ( I occasion pack unpack several times per month ) It 's easy connect disconnect 's `` Mode '' I place . Wonderful set-up I highly recommend ALL Martin ! Why n't I think ? Is says . From Martin , nuff said ! This bit hard install ; strings ? We tried . Over strings , would slide nut , n't good . Under strings , muffled . So kind , others . Other , works fine , holds strap problems . And puts name & # 34 ; Martin & # 34 ; box guitar ; ) . In , I 'd probably got strap button mounted base neck . But n't want , hate & # 34 ; lace & # 34 ; approach , trick . It may even fit better different guitars , 50 year-old ( actually sound AMAZING considering origins ; guess old wood SOUNDS better ) . And price VERY right able claim & # 34 ; A & # 34 ; Martin , lol . This beats using string going around headstock Martin . I 've heard horror stories devices coming loose guitars going head first floor ! Strings might look tacky 'll stay tied properly ! Just make sure button portion thru hole strap , pulled snugly wo n't pull . This vey simple fix constant problem guitar straps connect strap guitar . It goes neck strap connects easily . It great idea worth cost . I hate drill hole guitars . This I looking accoustic guitar . Makes life easier I pack set equipment . I like attach ALL guitars neck/headstock instead using thetop button , used typical shoestring past , get baby strap , going anywhere.I installed guitars ( one bass ) I play ( obviously ) give lot support string , dig tothe finish string try , may like way guitar sits , n't get comes attaching body guitar . Just I needed ... easy attach saved drilling hole guitar strap . Works like charm ! I recommend product . 
174	I read many negative reviews several sites . I understand quality may consistent , seasoned folk musician , I must say set I purchased quite good , especially lower pitched harps G , A Bb . There minor tuning issues instruments , especially folk instruments . This gives charm voice . I find whole set adequate quality I need replacement harps right away , many stated . The set quite nice , price ! This certainly step Hohner Blues Harmonica Set Amazon sells . I one . I thought O.K. , I found harps n't work well smell ! Actually went away awhile , beginning plastic odor made light ... .This nicer set . All harps work . They feel substantial . No smell . Pay extra money get set . The letters key wears pretty quickly . A . I bought add layer sound blues tunes I record , notes n't bend easily ... think cheat big boys harps , youll dissapointed quickly ... little toys compared $ 40 dollar harps , feel cheap decent sound ... dont know last , make harp noises without decent bends ... Ill use sparingly ... Jim Nice presentation , although harmonicas plastic , look sounds great . Also price great , go ahead , buy fun . Great beginner ! A , complete blues harp . With one key relatively small size must . I play harp I perform . I found Harmonica 's note 's 's hard play , I G Blues harp I compared G harp notes little . The C harp terrible . That said thing I like order case . I going see I return store credit . really lot wind inside play harmonicas , great really got blow hard get rocking , adding distortion helps brings better sound live studio . These fit budget plus get EVERY need song ... ... WOW ... Hohner around forever , well constructed instrument reliable company . Let start saying I never even opened . I 've given 3 star merely respect Hohner . I clue play , 'll look review ordered product based fact description states `` Includes deluxe , red pro type hard shell case '' . Well ... Music123 n't . When I asked Music123 , said `` oh ... well , provide Amazon catalogue , leave discretion input pictures descriptions items '' . REALLY ! ! ! ? ? ? Not come red case ( I n't really care anyway ) , n't come version case style ( I interested ) . The case 's shown , case 's sold individually many sites $ 19 . So I figured ... wow ! ... heck ? I 'm getting 7 harmonicas cost $ 6 piece puchased individually , I 'm getting $ 19 case . You 'd silly bite , right ? Well ... came cheaper , black zipper case , one Hohner logo . Save money order Musicians Friend . It 's price , free shipping , get actual item 's described site.In closing ... 's week since I sent product back Music123 , I still received refund . Do favor avoid ! ! ! I bought mostly case backup harps kicking around I need them.Some harps tune slightly , big deal , especially considering get ... This alright set beginner , good cheap backup set advanced harp 'll use case higher end Hohners needed . If broke performer harmonica blues need get back track , help much . That said , junk , cheap nasty instruments - plenty available much worse . Straight case , n't bend well , . Having experienced player break gets one behaving well couple days ( eight hours playing ) So far I persuaded G A Bb C bend enough satisfy curiosity , hold serious playing . I destroy harps easily , aggressive player , I felt like would certainly something even I may wear pretty quickly . For purpose I intended perform perfect - breaking , I pass non harp playing relative learn basics . Better use inexpensive harps squawk , set I buying six months ; promise musical ability follows . The advantage plastic comb I n't need pass germs - wash easily , damage . For price , get seven good harps , make presentable learner instruments , little prep . Without experienced blues player break , take bit patience learn bending - many YouTube videos teach method , try hard , crack harps - try learning bending lower key instruments first ; easier . 
175	I dunno , cause I 'm stingy stars . These nice sound . I old guitar I bought cheap garage sale son ( 8 time ) play , never really cared . I finally got started tune , steel strings broke . SO I replaced . It 's classic guitar , n't steel strings begin . great sounding strings . hear difference used . try buy another one proven performance . These really cheap strings sound ! ! really good ! ! obviously serious live performing playing friends rehearse , ones ! D'Addario strings never failed . These much better nylon strings I used buy ball end always broke . These strings sound nice ca n't go wrong price tag either . I guitar , made 1969 , , months , , , never change strings , , sounds great , , , I put strings , , wao , sounds wonderful , , guitarist fellows could believe sound guitar string change , , try , , best guitar problems . These first set new strings I dont really know fuss comparing strings seem work fine great tone . I really hear difference new old strings . The strings nice smooth , springy , easy press . These take break tone smooth warm . They made Cordoba C5 sound like expensive guitar . Not overly bright , richer tone I bought cheap 3/4 guitar sounded really bad . I replaced stock strings D'Addario strings made sound much better . Great prce old days , used tobe able 6 clear strings ... tis almost impossible ... strings even cheap semi ... prefer playing hi 3 treble strings ... nice , resonant , clean ... shrillbutwhat garbage metallica 3 supposed strings dont know ... Again , like someone else > > > > > sound transition nylon wire wound nylon makes move D G string THEY EVEN MAKE 6 strings sound similar one guitar even ? makes sound like 2 different totally ... sucks bad man I ca n't really say anything negative set nylon strings.It sounds really good classical guitar . Will buy future . I 've played guitar 35 years found D'Addario strings consistently good quality . They one maybe three companies I trust manufacture good set strings matter classification instrument . Whether classical ( nylon ) , acoustic ( brass ) electric ( nickel ) ... strings produce excellent sound string , one needs match size personal playing style . That comes reading reviews quite often , simply testing . But I 've never played set brand I n't like . They always provide vibrant tonal quality.And I n't work D'Addario ; long-time fan . : ) 
176	I agree reviews . These high quality sounding , comfortable ( I big head ! ) , durable headphones nice long cable spring reinforced headphone jack . Unless make money headphones ( money burn ) probably n't need anything better M50 's . The thing I would change would get rid collapsible cans - make headphones take less room folded ( good travelling ) I 'm old fashioned prefer rigid phones , bit quicker get n't unfold flip cans right orientation . No big deal though ! Comes nice screw 1/8 '' 1/4 '' adaptor . Bought plug practice bass amp ( wifey little nasty I get itch play 2 ) . I play 5 string I could believe deep sound I get , especially price range . Highly recommend ! These cans decent , back 100 bucks . They 've inflated 160 's ridiculous . There better price range . The SRH840 's example eBay bucks new , everything better cans . The M50 's really punchy bass , extremely stringent highs , 're loose low end , mids recessed . That combination makes tiring listening experience . The pads pleather terribly uncomfortable , whilst almost starchy texture . The headband clamps onto larger heads lacks decent padding underneath . These phones also terrible regards soundstage , means gaming , pretty terrible . They ... SOME ... new genres alright , extremely aggressive presentation makes phones hard listen . They also ca n't lighter genres like Jazz Classical due poor positoning . There much much better monitors price range , Shure SRH840 I 've said totally outclass headphones away , n't fall victim hype . Seriously , stop.Do n't like wonder fuss years , go ahead get pair . They awesome . When I finally got mine , I opted anniversary edition sale , I seeing regular right $ 119 ! ! That 's crazy cheap.I rather inexpensive Sony headphones eight years ( still actually ) comfy sound good , entirely accurate . The ATHM50S really solid studio headphones . I ca n't imagine I taken soooooo long try . They quality comfy , even I 'm wearing many headphones . Not long seasons anyway.I use ATHM50S home studio I started taking along gear bag studio sessions along 15 ' headphone ext cable.I feel foolish lived without cans long , n't ! I 've using Sennheiser 's years I pleased I decided try whim . I spent little ( $ 50 ) I 've paying well worth . I get flat response exactly I needed monitoring audio trivial bonus ... straight cord . I hate coiled cords . These headphones amazing ! They absolutely fantastic price ! The problem I face hurt head pressure wearing . But I need stretch ! I bought replace pair I 6 years . I used old headphones listening music tracking recording studio . These assumed role perform wonderfully . I play lot electric drums cans great job isolating outside world I hear inside headphones . music joy . Everyone opinion & # 34 ; burn & # 34 ; period , mine seemed open hours . I listen music 3 - 4 hours day . They sound like thought would . I love use play guitar sound awesome.I would buy . I also Bose Quiet 15 's AE2 's , Grado 's . become favorites . The Grado 's tight somewhat weak bass , amazing ( sometimes shrill ) , airy mids high 's great soundstage ; Bose 's pronounced bass Grado 's , good mids highs , less airy soundstage Grado 's , 's , best balance accurate pronounced ( excessively ) bass , excellent mids highs , good soundstage . They become favorite phones . Though bass pronounced , accurate depth , like top-line subwoofer , bass drum hits . All quite listening experience . I expecting taken heaven impressive compared beats ear would perfect recording vocals comes listening music I say go want know noise isolation feels like , putting hands ear . I picked impulse & # 8211 ; good sale I dissatisfied older , cheaper set Panasonic . I 'm glad I & # 8211 ; excellent headphones 've exceeded expectations every level . The sound quality exceptional solid job blocking external noise . They feel extremely sturdy well-made , cans nice , thick coiled cord ( although removable cord would nice bonus ) . Finally , important , 're incredibly comfortable . As video editor , I often wind wearing headphones hours time . The cans rotate two axis , conform shape head headband thick well-padded . They grip head snugly , without horrible & # 34 ; vice grip & # 34 ; 've heard several reviewers say best headphones found $ 200 . I n't tried enough pairs make judgement , I say I highly recommend . It 's one best purchases I 've made long time . These headphones kind classics . Very popular read headphone review websites . They certainly cut cheap headphones . However , I compare headphones ( Sennheiser HD595 's ) I find , inferior . I originally intended used digital piano I wanted isolation , HD595 's provide . These provide isolation sound markedly inferior . I think headphones task reproducing high quality classical music like open style headphones.I use work . They excellent blocking room noise provide enough quality listen music working.Unfortunately also nearly comfy Sennheisers . They bit small ears , I guess . And get hot . Overall good . They good price , though , fill niche I need . If I could find set really high quality closed cans piano ... My main headphones HD-280 's , I thought pretty good , I got . I several pair HD-280 's , one mixing audio , one practicing drums ( since decent isolation ) , one ' use.I one , amount detail great . I set M-Audio 's , touch clarity , considering price difference ... wow . For mixing audio though , ca n't use headphones comes getting stereo imaging right , , I think get used mixing , n't know headphones could sound good . garbage like ... buy NOT world music sounds.TOO MUCH BASS garbage ... guys really anything ? world gone bass crazy since 1981 ... lost analog , lost quality thanks tocompression mp3 , put ears , give ... bass ONLY , take leave go find headphones , thanks.kb I 've tried different kinds headphones past far Bose AE2 fits taste . I 've using years son borrowed month ago I 'm pretty sure intention giving back : ) ( Its 5th headphone borrowed ) I planned buy another one I said try something different . After reading reviews product I finally decided go . And WOW ... blown away . I 'm glad I tried something else . No regrets . This one really fits taste . The clarity superb bass awesome . First time I 've spent 25 bucks headphones . Use reference GNX4 guitar , easy listening . Very accurate coloration tone I detect . ( semi-audiophile ) A bit bass heavy overall great headphones . comfortable . get hot wear summer ! If goal use mixing , hit buy 6 sets various headphones low end nice phones , allow hear sounds phones use mix multi-track audio compare final mix set regular monitors . I research buy . I looked lot reviews , well youtube reviews comparing headphones , seemed clear favorites competitors Beats Pro ( 're spending least $ 100 total $ 200 name alone , rip-off ask ) . These clear fine tuned . My knock could use little padding top head . I completely blown away headphones . The second I got mail I plugged mac pro , opened played song . Simply put amazing , I able hear EVERY single track individually ! I later plugged ATH-M50 's Korg triton studio , recorded session great microphones edited project final cut results . The sound clear headphones notice every flaw matter small whatever working ( great thing ) . I worked lot headphones including cost many times I keep coming back . I seen people comment bass `` punchy enough '' simply true , bass amazing , stronger headphones would true source . Make mistake ATH-M50 's extremely accurate sound fantastic . I mix master music guys . Before audiophiles try stone death , listen ! I cant giant KRK monitors blasting small apartment , I solid pair affordable headphones present music true light . These Beats , make songs super bass , n't great fashion statement ; however , ARE work horses show music REALLY sounds . headphones exist , true , best price range opinion . I play Guitar first time head set drivers driving giving distorted sound . The amazing ! I 2 requires quality monitoring ( I use studio monitors , sometimes I need something one else hear ) , using HD Pro I put ( without burning ) , I blown away difference ! $ 20 , cans worth extra better , leather wrapped around much sturdier , pad flaking , piece piece . I 've owned several years found sufficient mixing purposes -- long I keep using reference songs comparison ... 's , ATH-M50 n't flat frequency response . They 're flatter phones hundred , find 're bit middy lacking lower treble regions compared good set studio , I found deficiency fixed EQ curve . parametric EQ following : [ +1dB @ 80Hz Q 5 ] , [ +1.5dB @ Q 2 ] , [ dB @ Q 1 ] , [ +1dB @ Q 1 ] , [ @ Q 3.5 ] , [ +1.5dB @ Q 3 ] . Save preset.If listen reference songs , 'll find pleasing , balanced , 3D kind sound compared original . I base correction curve published frequency response ATH-M50 . The proof worked headphones sound lot like good studio monitors . They translate better correction curve bass solid seems go 20Hz , felt heard . thumps feel like head motion sound . This headphones better studio monitors , unless well treated room good sub . I therefore use headphones adjust bass , relation reference songs . I also use editing slight sounds ( pops , clicks ) getting reverb tails right , help panning tracks -- VERY good , like magnifying foam pads black ' headband crack fall 2 years . I wrapped black sports tape around headband , works well . pads bought Amazon . So padding material coating could better made . That plus middy frequency response I give 4 stars instead 5 . But I still think 're best headphones mixing tracking couple hundred . As background , I 've recorded many jazz performances listen normally electrostatic speakers pair electrostatic headphones well dynamic Audio Technica headphones closed back isolating headphones greatly reduce background noise . That said difficult design well closed ear cups back create acoustic interaction back drivers . These headphones open sound , smooth midrange , excellent detail exaggerated treble solid , perhaps bit emphasized extremely comfortable , well made easy store . Finally pricing fine headphones inflated many high quality products . Highly recommended . Bought studio I using rough , taped together set headphones told people bring . Did quick search good quality studio quality headphones settled choice . I disappointed . Excellent sound quality I would pin Bose day . These headphones wonderful wear . They sound great . But 's enough days . With head band connected outside muff , fit head wide . The 2000 look . Read review though . They terrible.At first glance things serious pro grade , made durable components . Both ears swivel fit snug head . The head band n't bad , 's plastic material notice stretch see flexible pad top head starts come unglued . Not really big concern though . They long cord , I 'll talk later . It ends spin 1/4 standard sound things pristine . It 's muddy clear . They good amount bass . Because ear style drown lot background noise also n't leak noise like lot headphones Heavy Awesome sound- Comfortable Over ear Not worried breaking Always clear , never muddy , even high volumes- Very clear left right ear 1/4 Heavy coil Heavy ( weight never got annoying though ) - Looks 
177	I ordered three ... far ! Very affordable good quality . Made wireless unit snug tight.Easy Velcro retaining strap . ( leather . ) I use little plastic flat ring bottom loop strap keeps tight guitar strap.The width slots 1 inch 1/16 & # 34 ; approximately 27 mm wide . The leather bend little allow slightly larger tighter much better I suspected expensive Levy 's classic padded straps . They fit like glove high quality without getting ridiculous click item go product page I uploaded photos actual use . I purchased item immediatly noticed upon arrival slits strap go way small typical strap . Way small , maybe like third width . I normal planet waves strap , fit . However , hold transmitter nicely securely . So looks like I get creative duct tape something.UPDATE : When attached rubber bands planet waves strap , stays pretty snugly . But need attach something . I really like ! ! ! ! ! You Levy 's strap use since durable comfortable I already two . I never worry transmitter hitting floor . I check battery level I playing , strap goes leds , minor issue . Most good wireless transmitters use one two batteries . I always use new ones I know I way juice I need practice whatever.This ruggedly made I think last ever . What 's impressive n't top-drawer leather craftsmanship -- goes without saying Levy 's . 's clever design , way fits onto almost guitar strap , adjusts almost position , adjusts ( almost ) small wireless transmitter . transmitter , receiver ! I like fits well strap good snug hold receiver

179	Most reviews pretty much covered everything I would say however I still want say I love tool . Not someone lot theory belt , 's useful help learn letters keys . I making progress key signatures I know I fretboard & I go . I use putting music stand , dialing key I want , turn drum machine & simply play chords key beat . Then I want practice relevant scales key , I simply look letters count fingering corresponding note . It 's easy.I say I agree instructions wee bit thin taste music notation & theory subject average player adept . Most folks self taught like moi theory concerned . To really grasp , one simply plod along actually performing exercises repeatedly . But rote repetition , eventually comes `` ! '' moment time time & falls others , I 'm one lug something around gig bag . Who really going set & study material like prior gig ? That 's home 's called ' reason.I give 5 5 stars really fantastic learning tool & relatively simple use long music theory . If , may want take lessons & use study guide along regular lessons . Yeah I kind bought whim , 's confusing hell first . I n't really understand shipped explained perfectly described . : ) This useful quite educational musician 's piece . I especially like way presented easy use . It easily helps remember possible scales shows many tricks musical compositions . Highly recommended . Cheers ! I love little device ! I 'm amateur musician I 'm playing . I play enough I need know theory , often I n't forget specifics.This gizmo lets refresh pesky details slide tab.I n't believe tool teach people music theory , wonderful reference know 're looking example , I 'm playing harmonica . Simple little instrument right ? Well simple little instrument thinking major , minor , major pentatonic , minor pentatonic , blues scales 12 different keys ! One section wheel lists different scales . Rotate dial key 're interested individual notes scales key 've selected appears . I play guitar , I find side wheel less helpful . Yes show play diatonic chords ( ) barre chords based upon `` E '' chord . If understand E barre chord family ( E , , , , , etc ) , may helpful . I really n't use E barre chords much beyond 7 fret I usually switch `` A '' type barre chord based 5th string hand much less distance travel . I 've found anything support `` A '' type barre chords others : D , G , find music theory side wheel worth price guitar side due ignorance . Tons useful information wheel . My criticism accompanying manual could far exhaustive clearly written . Seems like reasonably durable construction . Compact enough stow guitar case . The complaint I instructions kind shallow , musical theory background much trouble , I 'm expert I knowledge beyond basic , 's really take reference learning new things , visualize quickly chords , scales , minor scales , view relationship 's great tool learn , deep knowledge maybe dont need . For complete begginers might difficult start without reading taking time study . This great complement study theory . A good tool study applying music . Keep hand help understand theory . Also great starting learning instrument . This fantastic product well made . The plastic heavy duty comes plastic cover must removed use . This ensures wheel get perfect tool extremely useful . I started playing band , common band members call song key . With wheel , I immediately know chords choose . I also know notes chord . In addition , note note image entire fretboard see roots scale playing.The wheel also invaluable switching keys . For example , say 're playing I , IV , V chords key C. , lead singer trouble would rather sing Bb . All need dial wheel Bb , find new I , IV , V chords , start playing . The wheel makes chord transposition breeze.I feel negative reviews seeing unfair . This useful product fair price.No , I company . I 'm band member newbie tool.In opinion , five star product . I 'm songwriter always looking compatible chords . This wheel made fun find chords work well together , quick easy use . This educational device truly asset musicians , especially guitar players . Because gives complete scales , moments glance I find extremely helpful hands busy , mind wandering . I 'd suggest beginners . More intermediate musician . It something going understand first . The learning curve moderate . Other , quite useful durable . I confused portal confusion . Looking makes ill - I feel like 's laughing , scribbles . I self taught , pup essential tune writing , finding quickie relative such.If want understand theory , start learning basic basic chords relate , Baby . If 're boss , need Powers ?

181	I Fender T Bucket acoustic guitar I put heavy guage strings . As beginner strings good . I tried blow away heavy guage strings . Good quality . Glad I bought . Nice overall , good sustained ring steel strings ( 1-2 ) bit metalic sound wound strings ( 3-6 ) . I like sound I get Yamaha acoustic . I love strings , I 've tried others I always come back , great beginners , phosphor Bronze provide tone I prefer , still bright . I read reviews Ernie Ball strings . I say I love strings . They rich sound brings acoustic alive . Who say 's Ernie Ball ca n't make good Acoustic Strings . This set sounds fine money forget Amazon ! : ) What I say , Ernie Ball Slinky strings . I 've using Slinkys acoustics electrics 40 years never let ( Unlike higher priced strings ) I might add . Very responsive never dull weak sounding . Crisp highs smooth lows n't get & # 34 ; & # 34 ; . I would recommend anyone least try set acoustic guitar Ernie Ball Super Slinkys electric guitar . Still , years innovations strings , Ernie Ball still gets vote hands ! !

183	As Boss / Roland products , Boss FS-6 performs designed . I purchased control Boss ME 20 Multi effects pedal Fender Blues Jr amp . The A switch ( non latching mode ) allows cycle stored effects banks ME 20 B switch ( latching mode ) allows engage disengage FAT ( overdrive ) switch Blues Jr Amp . Everything works exactly planned . The FS-6 rugged , compact ( fits right ME 20 carrying case ) easy use.I read reviews people complaining batteries ... something complain . As guitar players I n't use batteries effects pedals I use 9 volt AC/DC adapter . Visual Sound offers `` One Spot '' AC/DC adapter kit 9 volt battery snap connector adapter . I removed battery cover , using small rat tail file I carefully cut notch battery cover snap connector pass . I put rubber feet ( purchased ACE Hardware ) bottom allow snap connector cable ... battery problem solved.I also use FS-6 sustain pedal Yamaha 225 portable grand piano control RC-3 Loop Station simultaneously . The possibilities limited imagination . It somewhat expensive Great Product ! ! If need switch I highly recommend purchasing FS-6 . Neither delighted disappointed . I found intuitive use battery compartment joke , otherwise construction good . I dont use much I havent really figured I want , big fit briefcase full blues harps , I behringer A/B switch job . I needed footswitch variety applications include acoustic amp , guitar amps , gear . Built like tank completely configurable . Well done , Roland ! I bought pedal companion Roland AC-33 Acoustic Amp . The pedal face looks like good piece equipment feels quite sturdy . However use 9 volt batter make operate . This totally unnecessary foot-switch . The worst part leads battery connector ( 9 volt ) properly soldered shorted . The way I could get function let 9volt battery right connection would made . For rather high asking price limited function needed ( i.e . work two switches battery ) would think Boss would put better product . I also found battery cover extremely cheap difficult close , leading believe durability cover question . I would HIGHLY recommend look another maker switch consider one readily available parts purchased site . I use pedal tandem map buttons various controls Ableton . The foot switch opens door organic sound live performances prepared track . The polarity switches nice , however switches makes unit compatible DAW . Some functions play stop momentary functions , functions track on/off toggle/latch functions . Without foot switch toggle two , applications limited certain functions . I use footswitch variety applications , variety songs different arrangements . If I could hook one controller , I 'd four , one nice . I bought use Boss ME-70 . I use go banks I programmed ME-70 . Build like tank . Simply use . Simply hook . I hear used Boss Roland gear . Works well . Very well constructed . Would kill ya add on/off switch batteries n't run ? Other , 's perfect ! new guitar way much fun , makes playing sound like I may know I , easy setup easy use

185	I play small guitar Amp . Great way wake kids . Works perfectly purpose . Keep mind small end stereo large end goes amp mono . If needing stereo jack ends get something else . plugged works connect mono line stereo input amp . much else I tell I bought hook live stage sound systems , stereo anyway , use stereo-to-mono adapters 2 separate channels 's needed ? Perfect solution , seems durable . I carry bass gig bag I plug phone mono back Genz Benz bass head . Handy rehearsals band needs listen track working arrangement ( bass cab full range fEARful 15/6/1 ) . Before picking , I used couple cables / adapters go stereo 1/8 & # 34 ; mono 1/4 & # 34 ; often seemed I never quite I needed hand . This ... A super cheap mono cable . It sufficient many needs cheap enough thin wire gauge . Just aware cheap unshielded , etc.For price intent , I almost gave 5 stars . But 's 5-star cable ... It 's fair quality ultra cheap cable . 4 stars seems right . ( Yes , almost exactly I wrote Hosa cable I reviewed . ) It 's hard love cord carries way end . Not sure , complete failure would take stars away . Cables cables . They usually work . And Amazon , always find best deals quality . 
186	For price , box works well expensive one would . Just put 9v battery works right away . Three knobs control tone , level distortion get perfect sound . I recommend get power adapter , eats us batteries like crazy . I accidentally left hours juice dry , batteries expensive , get power supply . Overall , good budget buy , wo n't need money quality . What ask pedal runs twelve clams ships free ? This highest quality pedal terms construction tones , gets job done nicely cheap . If starting experement stomp boxes ( addicted collecting stompboxes like truely ) , ca n't go wrong FAB line . I find placement knobs slightly annoying , 's nitpick price point . If looking something like Boss DS-1 , pretty much cover bases less quarter price Boss pedal . If looking light breakup kind box cheap , get dano overdrive instead ( silver one ) . I also find ten bucks , Behringer makes great clone pedals . Look price , thing really sounds good . It 's toy , 's real Retro Electric Guitar Effects Pedal . I 'm happy purchase This pedal works great n't slide . The adjustment helps get right amount distortion I need . Not best pedal far , great beginner limited budget . The reason I 'm giving one star I n't expect much low cost pedal . I got one guitar players could use switch clean tones distortion rental practice space gets money buy halfstack decent sounding pedals . We punk ska band ( think suicide machines , sublime ) need switch lot songs . I thought pedal would get us someway . NOPE . This pedal sucks guitar 's tone , turn knobs way get anything going , pleasant sound either way . AVOID . This pedal sounds great fender excelsior 's 15 inch speaker also good 1960 's danelectro tweed amp 's bright weber ceramic 8 inch speaker . I use entire range tone knob go aggressive growls low end screaming lead tones end , never sounds harsh . The clipping sweet musical , sound reminiscent cranked amplifier stacks front ends pushed overdrive pedals . Sometimes I feed SD-1 Danelectro D-2 overdrive puts top . FOR THE PRICE , pedals outstanding . The QC may perfect , duds , I would say worth risk , circuits like vintage pedals although use cheaper components boards . As long dont literally stomp pedal dont drop stairs , last long enough make worth . Also , blue LED somewhat bright annoying , good indicator I guess 's job . Overall , rock ! I 've written would nice find multi-pedal arrangement space saving ... I still end looking individual pedals individual sounds . The Danelectro FAB series pedals offer great sound without digging budget . The Distortion effects pedal works great gives mind blowing distortion would expect expensive unit ... The reason I n't give 5 stars & # 34 ; It tends little noisey & # 34 ; turn gain much . You get noise filter add pedal board take care noise problems may . This series pedals ( FAB ) hard plastic cases less expensive hardware costly units works quit well . Danelectro offers expensive units I n't think sound much better , hardware better , thats view ! ! ! . You ca n't go wrong product , Danelectro around years makes great product ... I six Danelectro effects pedals work great ... Great little pedal , economical worked flawlessly . It n't power supply battery included , low price expect ? Besides batteries n't expensive . nice distortion Fender guitar . Great product . Musicfriends , This item - For 20.00 You ca n't go wrong . Warm distortion good controls . For great studio/recording use thats . I would certainly tour ... built cheap w. plastic housing one circuit board squeezed funny enough one piece rugged metal ... bottom plate . Hello designers ... . Metal around top plastic bottom must . But anyways , bottom line great unit 20.00 sounds good versatile . I looking pedal n't take life 's savings still performed well . I found right , works well problems report . next week I 'll purchase another ( different feature ) . It also arrived super fast . This delay pedal doesnt give massive distortion , nice bit fuzz . I 'm impressed get price ! I love lot Danelectro products , really one , give 3/5 works features good . True Bypass requires 9v wall plug , adjustments 'S MY The Distortion . ' It distorts , sure , sound dimensional ... depth fine someone playing one various metal genres , play lot blues-rock ... I ended switching overdrive , maybe . 
187	I one spend lot batteries brainer . It worked great year least . I look I 3 years tomorrow . make sure get get tascam . I n't run without power source , seems . jack price would viola ! I know . Works fine Tascam DP-008 I also bought Amazon , saves lot batteries . What else say ? It works . If want use power Tascam DR series digital recorder , I less expensive solution : usb wall charger ( like cell phone charger ) , use power device usb port . That 's lot cheaper spending twenty-something dollars additional wall wart ! I got I ordered . However , I paid attention , nothing standard power supply I could gotten much cheaper radio shack like type store without Tascam name it.UPDATE receiving comments reading reviews : I 've gotten comment read many comments I n't know fault lies , power supply NOT power supply new replacement Tascam DR-07MKII . The power supply unit unsure power supply model Tascam recorder , go Tascam 's website research buying it.The Tascam AC Supply For DOES work older Tascam DR-07 recorder . I using recording stand alone unit taking line powered PA head using power supply works fine quality recorder excellent .

189	The last thing I would think upgrade improve quality music cable . I know cables actually made difference . My guitar sounds cleaner I use cable versus another generic cable I 've . It pleasant surprise . I also heard wonderful warranty Monster . The cable many good things going , I know buy next time I need one . I n't sure hype folks giving cable , I - really improved sound acoustic guitar amp.I little experiment . I plugged old cable , played guitar I adjusted amp I got pleasant sound speakers . Then , I turned amp , unplugged old cable plugged new Monster Rock cable . Next , I simply turned amp back ( sound levels already set I touch ) played guitar . The volume louder I think nicer new Monster cable.I 'm buying Monster Rock cables replace old cables . You find another review , suffice say I wo n't skimp cables I spend 1000 's amps cabinets good sound . These n't first set , I ca n't count amount Monster 1/4 cables I bought . None ever failed far . Highly recommend ! It 's hard beat quality Monster Cables ! There absolutely No discernible loss tone cable - I Love It ! I compared cable monster studio pro 1000 cable also . I prefer play live good job handling noise snd also questions asked lifetime warranty . Just take broken cable local guitar center replace . I got 4 replacememts 3 years . Worth higher price warranty . The 100 dollar studio pro doesnt well live compared rock cable studio pro sucks tone snd sounds good recording . note , cable high mid range thats like go 
190	This pick great , highly recommended ! I love sharp attack metal tip flexible body means attack overly aggressive sounding . I also I prefer feel flexible pick . Grip good . This new favorite rock pick ! high end pick . felt comfortable even larger size . took awhile get used really liked . I collect picks ( plectrums 're purist ) I good reason : I n't use pick sort playing style . I tend use picks jazz ; blues ; metal . Not picks made & far better others.The Dava Master Control Pick ( DMCP ) nice & useful pick . I 've enjoying heavy strumming ( metalheads call , `` ' '' ) . I like thin center way overall contoured makes holding delight forefinger & thumb.Another thing I really like metal tip folks may enjoy give bit metallic tone touches strings . This especially true 've replaced old guitar 's strings new ones . Depends like whether like metallic ting - I certain pick 's construction seems fairly rigid & yet potential merely chug low E & A strings . DMCP definitely plectrum I using lot future hard core metal also subtle tones jazz passages distortion I give DMCP 5 5 stars claimed something I find great utility years come . This pick give distinct tone 's made metal , plastic . I 'm sure wo n't wear time soon either . The size regular . I wish sharper point , I still pick fast enough play speed metal . I usually use Dunlop big stubby 2.0 picks . I used Master Control Pick first time today , I order two , 're amazing ! ! The attack second none ! ! At first pick felt bit strange I 'm accustomed thicker Dunlop , I admit initially I bit weary notably thinner Dava ; way playing hindered , anything seems run along strings effortlessly , far comfortable picks I 've ever used ! ! What find ! ! UPDATE : Still best pick I 've ever played . If 're worried metal tip pick breaking weakening strings , n't worry , wo n't ( least I 've seen ) . Also , pinch harmonics easiest thing world play picks !

Not much review simple tabletop mic stand . Solid heavy base . Well built . Does job holding mic . No , less . I bought stand mic kick drum . It 's tall lining mic port -- even 's shortest setting . Still , 's well-constructed would make good desk-top mic mount . I like On Stage stuff . Good value , good function . 
193	For price I think 's hard get better . I love case . It fits perfectly overhead bin . It 's light feels comfortable carry . Had mine 2 years complaints , still good new . The look inspiring , protects guitar . Some reviews mentioning faulty hinges I 've problems mine . I tried store . It looks like would protect guitar , latches kind large clumsy . The interior nothing special either . I passed . I recently purchased used American Fender Strat came old tweed case ... nice case , n't provide protection I need guitars . The case built like tank provides great protection locks travel . A no-brainer Fender guitars . I recently traveled across country carrying 2 similar guitars , Fender American Standard Strat Fender American Standard Telecaster . One SKB Fender case ( $ 99.95 Amazon ) , Gator case purchased locally . I told good Fender case . Both ended checked luggage . After 1 flight Florida LAX back ( non-stop , minimal handling ) glue top section Gator case gave . The padding loose strap keep top flopping completely open dangling inside case . Neither guitar damaged cases appear fine shape , padding loose , Gator case going require repair used . Other couple scuff marks SKB Fender case , 's good new . I ordered another SKB Fender case . The Gator re-glued used local trips cheaper guitars . The SKB Fenders airline cases . Sturdy - great latches - I love handle - comfortable carry - nice big fits hand well.Not lot interior storage - Strat fits well - secure enough room inside strap cleaning cloth , picks set strings - much old case I could also fit Boss TU-3 tuner - ensures thinner , lighter case.The case also well balanced guitar I purchase another Strat I purchase case . Great case . Heavy duty . Rugged . Sturdy . ** - still holding well !

195	I bought practice . I $ 180 amp , looking something little portable . This I came to.It great distortion , effect pretty awesome ! The lead cuts clean ; & # 34 ; mostly & # 34 ; . In general tend get little noisy though . However . For price , probably one best steals ever . Like I said , I & # 34 ; sort-of & # 34 ; name brand amp estimated around $ 180 . I safely say sound quality item good amp . Until I afford REALLY good amp , primary one ; really I problem that.Pros : -Cheap sound quality-Nifty Built-in plug AUX letting play : -Cheap ITEM quality-Distortion get & # 34 ; messy & # 34 ; versatile ... Metal hope never breaks . Amazing ! I plugged little gadget Strat , put headphones wow I super surprised ! The sound amazing . You adjust amount gain volume fine tune sound whether playing humbuckers single coils . I love sound I get either Strat Les Paul . Best practice loud like without bothering anybody . I plug little monster compressor compressor guitar sound amazing . I really like sound fact totally portable independent power ( runs two AAA batteries ) . The digital delay effect activated independently , ( little switch one extra click ) fine , ca n't adjust speed mix . That 's OK though factory setting works fine want touch delay . All , I highly recommend Vox Lead Guitar Headphone Amp sound price . One small con , made plastic seems bit fragile . For I use , hot setup ! Great quick practice really sounds nice . Wide overdrive tone range . The delay feature basically simple slap-back echo ( I 'd much rather chorus ) price sound I 'm quite pleased . works well . I . little different thing , great traveling , late night need play stuff , rest family interest desire get better . sound , effects , etc. , adequate good need without real . I say I pretty skeptical would sound I shocked sounds I could took seconds dial tone I wanted went.For money ease practicing anytime great tone worth twice far durability I month used 10 times , far good.I purchase protection plan $ 10 I 'm covered 2 years . I bit disappointed gadget . It n't quality sound I expected material written . I 've much better luck simple interface guitar iPhone iPad . That arrangement n't compact Vox product , sound much pleasing . 
196	I think 's good wiping playing buffing wax classical guitar bodies , I think I prefer old flannel cloths instead . Micro-fiber seems slicker generally feel job ( mostly removing finger prints etc ) . Maybe needs wear bit thicker nap . ordered ... come different sizes ... price fine ... keep em every case ... buy I chose rating I found product superior similar products I purchased past . This good micro-fiber cloth , I guess Ernie Ball costs clothes . But like , axes , I one gig ! I n't recommend using polish , wipe guitar bass use . Works great without polish . It good size ziplock bag comes keeps polish I use drying . Surprisingly cloth soft durable . Works well polish natural wood instruments . I plan get another one laptop computer 's cling quality dust . It described , I happy ! Amazon always comes , without hitch , delivered usual stated time ! Removes grime . Makes surfaces smooth ( I n't know works individually , I used Gerlitz cleaning spray ) . It works well cleaning spray . good job polishing strat playing , reasonably priced , definitely something keep around play guitar regularly ! It works relatively inexpensive . I keep original packaging stays fresher really makes finish guitar shine like new . Awesome little untreated polishing cloth . I purchased guitars ( I care admit ) fantastic . They clean great , removing oil fingerprints reasonably priced . Awesome product keep axe looking great . 
197	If looking walk around play guitar , might want look something longer . As spare cable play home though , 's pretty good . There 's another brand almost identical construction quality costs less . Do n't buy high rated chrome capped one 's , I problems . This one good I regret paying much . It 's guitar cable . It works . It appears well made durable . There noise hum . It works I like . I finally bought Monster Cable hype ; albeit 6 ' practice cable . I CAN honestly tell difference . That difference silence ; abnormal hissing popping I got , cheaper cables . This n't top-of-the-line Monster , still step I 'd using . I 'll definitely upgrade longer cables Monster , may even see expensive one sounds ( short one 1st , course ! ) . I gave 5 star monster cables come life time warranty depending breaks , 6ft cord taller means 's 6 ' 2 & # 34 ; tall ... 's great product money 's used late night practice small amp pedal connection amp , 's short sturdy enough take roughest still keep working Monster Standard instrument cable amazingly good price . It 's flexible ( unlike expensive cable ) , quiet , solid , durable . It 's much transparent tone many expensive cables . For money , 's really hard beat . I wo n't waste money expensive cables . great cables gave four playing cheap rotosound cables learned good 3 bucks . still great cable sound slightly better rotosound thats super isnt much difference . I 'm keyboard player , past I spending $ 40- $ 60 Monster 's `` '' keyboard cables . But suddenly one shorted several months use , causing question `` Monster . '' I began compare Monster keyboard cables cheap , `` off-brand '' guitar cables could n't hear difference . No question 's well-made , trustworthy ( indestructible ) cable , I 'm longer committed price . However , Amazon 's current `` value '' price particular Monster cable , 's no-brainer . Moreover , I longer hesitations purchasing cable n't say `` piano '' `` keyboard '' . ( One Monster keyboard cables even came one end designated amp instrument -- hard see dimly lit club . ) As length , 6 feet ideal 're playing amp ( preference ) . If 're plugging board P.A . system , 'll want anywhere 12 feet 25 feet . It 's made monster cable . Need I say ? Of course 's great cable , able change rubber band ends nice identify cable . This cable Works fine , 'm going buy pair January 2013 . I used live really great , durable feel 's pro . Try one . Great cable patching rocking . It also low noise suitable recording well . 100 % Recommend anyone looking good quality ( without top price ) cable ! ! 
198	best strings around . last long time especially live near beach corrosion always concern . I keep acoustic stand office keep handy inspiration strikes . I used d'addarios many years . I switched longevity drastically noticeable . sound great . The added expense made extra long life afforded coating . They 're 2 days sound fantastic already . I 've come expect nothing excellence Elixirs , 're best I 've played date , whether electric acoustic . I highly recommend anyone looking get great tone straight box Personally , I love nanoweb strings . I 4 guitars , get played every couple weeks . As I 'm pro , I n't want put strings I 'm going change every time , mess around n't mind extra slippery , sound tad bit `` different '' strings . They 're exactly I want - A string makes guitar sound good 4 months without changing strings . These acoustic strings used Laguna acoustic guitar . They right weight , right amount flex . We 've tried D'Addario , brighter sound ( D'Addario Acoustic Guitar Strings Set , EXP 80/20 Lite ) , Martin , little stiff ( Martin Strings SP Phosphor Bronze 12.5-55 MSP4150 ) . In end , Elixirs sound feel best guitar.The difference strings - nanoweb polyweb - nano 's light coating almost n't feel . So like standard coated strings , nano 's probably way go . If want bit softness , polys better said , perfect guitar string everyone . The perfect guitar string one feels sounds right guitar . For combination , outstanding strings.On strings lasting longer , 's hard say . Fresh strings sound better . It 's clear wound strings corrode like non-coated strings . But I 'm certain last much longer . We buy sound good right amount flex - playability . Corrosion crud string n't sole factor changing strings.Elixir wonderful company . On third fourth sets Elixir strings , G string snapped son tuning guitar first time . Elixir outstanding , replace string n't perform standard.The amazing thing - I 've watched tons videos watched lot guys change strings , I 'm still confused . The Elixir website ( 's pretty simple elixirstring dot com ) outstanding . Ther two part video Taylor factory change strings . I swear follow instructions , change strings minutes . It simple reproducible . I love technique . Elixir Strings best I ever used , sound great last far longer ( tonally ) anything else I tried ... .. I play Elixir strings . They relatively finger friendly , hold tune well much longer lasting many strings I played past . These electric acoustic I bought , I got lighter string I normally play . I move mediums I get feel guitar . Of course , Elixirs well . Elixir 's Nanoweb Light Phosphor Bronze strings best strings I 've ever used Alvarez acoustic -- guitar I 've owned 30 years . They certainly longest lasting strings seem , nice punchy tone , easy fingers . Unlike Elixir Extra Lights I found lacking bass tad mushy side short-scale guitar , seem like ideal combination . I may buy another set soon restring short-scale instrument lights . Compared brands gauges `` old school '' strings , may little less bass response , sound good , pretty even set , convenience change strings often outweighs whatever minor issues one might ping low E string . You go wrong Elixir accoustic guitar strings . strings difficult discuss one may appeal another . However , go wrong strings . I highly recommend . I like mellow sound last longer strings I tried . This brand I would ever buy sound superior easy play . These well worth money ! I love Elixir strings . They sound great play easy . I would recommend anyone . Give try.. I beginner guitar player , I n't much experience different types strings . But , I say compared stock strings Fender Acoustic guitar , things like night day . A much brighter sounds little easier fingers . Highly recommended . You never go wrong Elixir Strings Acoustic Phosphor Bronze Strings , , ... The great long lasting sound worth extra cost . These strings okay - last 4 months start fray little bit . seemed litte expensive play know last VERY long time sound great , strings focused performance , best string I 've ever played ! I absolutely love strings . They enhance deep rich sound dreadnought . They last long time keep great sound long time . If way give 10 stars I would . Polyweb strings heavier coating I prefer nanoweb ultra-thin coat brighter sound . They 're easy fingers make beautiful sound . Because 're coated , last months longer regular strings n't make much finger sounds . Favorite strings . I use elixirs taylor 1 , last months end maintaining new string zing , 2 super smooth . It 's like playing silk guitar . Get strings . These strings noticeably warmer compared brighter Bronze Nanoweb . Still great guitar string . A real winner Elixir & # 34 ; Goretex & # 34 ; A real triumph re-invention . Well done Goretex ! If like big dreadnaught , especially one spruce top scalped X bracing , really get strings . They bring brightness guitar hiding D'Daddarios price . Best last extremely long , I 've broken strings past months . Overall great strings pretty consistent . Very good string ! ! I 've using Elixir strings ten years . I 've full time musician 14 years I sound best last 3 month 's . Within ten years I 've 2 strings break , I sometimes work 6 days week many time I never much fan coated strings . I normally use DAddario EJ 16 's I like Elixirs , 4 weeks playing starting fade , stay tune I notice fuzz wound strings sound hole . They feel nice touch nice tone pretty expensive four week turnaround 
199	Put PRS SE 245 I love em . I restring matter minute maybe 2 . They perfect fit . No problems whatsoever . I purchased two sets Mini Locking Rotomatics . No winding string wraps around tuning post . string change ever . Insert string , wind half turn , string locked tuner . No slipping tune . Rotomatics go every guitar build I . Use replace garbage machines came ( older model ) Gold Tone banjo ukulele . Smooth silk , work great - ! These really direct replacements PRS SE line . Only machine heads somewhat smaller . A great product . Super nice locking tuners . Used direct drop replacement Paul Reed Smith really helped tuning stability . The smaller tuner buttons looked little strange first , installed looks great works great . They call mini tuners , right . Some tuners big bulky looking imho . I installed PRS SE Santana minutes . They direct drop ins . To use simply grab top turn clicks . Then line hole center headstock , insert string turn tuning peg . You 'll feel & # 34 ; lock & # 34 ; another quarter turn string tune . They really good tuners I think anyone pleased tuning stability offer . 
200	I bought upgrade Eurorack 802 I . I 'm quite please Xenyx 1202 . Lots inputs , phantom power , produces really great sound ! I 'm happy little mixer . This mixer four mic inputs . It fun effects . This mixer comes 80Hz filter 3-band equalizer mic channels . It used mono output need mono . I hear external noise . It durable metalic case . This mixer great audio . I actually trying buy smaller Xenyx I bought one , I 'm glad I got model . Unbelievable amount flexibility built . I use UCA202 audio interface Audio-Technica AT2035 recording PC Audacity every day since I unpacked problems . Makes perfect small studio combination ! I Behringer Xenyx 1202FX , essentially model costs 20 dollars FX ( comes 100 set effects ) . I home recording Cubase Logic , using Presonus Firebox audio interface , MIDI , vocals instruments , n't use mixing board , eventually decided try one given ( ) making reasonable prices ( b ) I inputs outputs Firebox could easily handle.This mixing board n't look impressive I first checked , set used , operates well cleanly . The fact comes four mic inputs preamps plus . The fact on/off switch minus . But basically works well , EQ useful , large number inputs outputs small mixer . Behringer makes range models less/more inputs suit one 's needs , great . Also , dedicated mixer makes easier , I leave inputs connected adjust things mixer depending I want record . Another small thing mixing button cuts line altogether -- turn zero . And , faders ( except main ) ; instead uses knobs everything . Well , I would liked things , I would pay , I really wanted functionality good price , Behringer Xenyx delivered thus far.By way , I running following mixer : AT3035 audiotechnica condenser mic , Alesis QS8.1 , guitar via line-in ( mic 'd ) , two KRK RP5 studio monitors , Presonus Firebox . Everything 's working sounding great thus far . Since I 'm using Logic , effects basically unnecessary , I ever want use board live use , I may , could come handy . I 'd say effects so-so . I giving item 5 stars awesome litle mixer , expecting much price little unit ( small ) I went Mackie 1202 Berhinger 1202 ( anyone see similarity ) , basically Mackie mixer slightly smaller , recieved , hooked worked perfect , minor sounded good Mackie , perhaps better , plus took less space desk . Only weird thing unit mentioned ON & OFF switch , ? ... solved using power strip using power strip power unit , way power & unplugging back turn , plugging back turn , using power strip avoid much wear tear power source connector , really stupid Behringer , never ever kind mixer without power & button . All price , I complain much , pick another daughters studio good . 
201	GREAT strings ! Good quality good sound . These seem lot stable 10-46 I using . play metal / hard rock used many different strings , give best tone depth need play hard music best idea anyone strings bass decide . I fan Slinky guitar strings I got Schecter 4 string bass . Like made . The strings fantastic . The sound deep heavy , exactly I looking . Makes bass sound pretty bad @ $ $ . I cranked bass amplifier putting strings sound pure , powerful , blew worth money . Feels great , sounds great , 's little bit magic strings . High quality classics add touch class sound .

Other really works well taking away echo loud speakers playing rockband . 
204	So , ended wrong taper guitar , fault due incorrect advice . Nonetheless , I put couple compare old , plastic pins . What difference ! Unquestionably , sound board far sensitive . Sustain much better I got richer tone , opposed brighter tone users reported . I say , however , I got definitely true , ebony wood pins inlay . I ca n't speak concerns plastic used pin colors . While wo n't work due size , I 'll definitely making switch plastic ebony I find right size . Make sure read description color choosing . Most plastic.I bought ebony inlay . They look great , , indeed , real ebony pearl pins sort odd size ( sure generic pin size ... ) , might work , might . They fit one mine perfectly , another , well . I would assume fit Martin guitars well , experience Martin instruments pretty similarly made way parts quality.Overall , great bridge pins price , sounds much better plastic ones ! I purchased product replace pins Martin 0-16NY . I believe ebony pins admirably . Additionally , pearl inlay lends class guitar . Really nice upgrade ... especially price . They stick higher plastic pins , I read would . At least I know fit snug . Really look good ! Thanks prompt good service . These quality product really enhance Guitar I happy Thanks ! ! ! 
205	I use 21 ' cable . Great build quality , looks professional , sturdy plugs , importantly sounds great ! I like smooth fabric sleeve , n't stick things like plastic/rubber cable . This first cable . I think I 've Spectraflex cables , 've fine , I 've owned , lost , lent , etc . many years I ca n't recall . The look feel cable excellent . Seems solid , 's always difficult tell cables . I like flexibility much better Monster cable , much stiffer tends want coil back onto . The fatso nice flexible , looks fantastic . It sounds fine , issues . I 'm one snakeoil high-end cables necessary . Get something decent n't noisy , tone comes equipment . No issues regard last thing - 've got ta love Amazon . I got 10 ' red 14 ' violet ~ $ 15 , colors lengths twice price . So , I n't colors I got . THey look great , though . Oh , one thing I 'm bit iffy Spectraflex 's lifetime warranty . The fine print requires sales receipt ( BS IMO ) says something affect `` decide replace '' . So , way Monster , 'll replace anything receipt , reasonable , I think . But I 'll worry 's time worry , 's worth considering , return process might exactly hassle-free . This great instrument cable . If ever used rubber covered try one . The fabric cover eliminates knots twists & # 34 ; regular & # 34 ; cables . This one great looking cable . I purchased cable December 2010 still working well stilllooks good . And says , `` better look good feel good '' . Well , cables.This cable 20 AWG , `` Copper Center Conductor '' 100 % copper shield . You want good shield going playing loud . Helps keep ugly away want big time.The capacitance cable according manufacturer 39 . This one spec wantto pay attention buying instrument cables . The lower number , least resistance whichresults higher performing cable expect sound beefy output . It seems lows mids highs nice indeed . This seems nicely balanced cable money.This cable comes colors braided cover style . They look terrific I find `` Fatso '' coil thinner Spectraflex 'Vintage ' company makes . The n't seem lend easy coiling . It also seems become twisted lot easier thus straighten coil storage . The easiest cables coil , way , Lava Cable , '' '' , black rubber jacket dream coil . If I need cable , quitehonestly I would buy Lava . Pretty n't count much me.I gave cable 4 stars good sound , well constructed , excellent shrunk rubbercovering plugs , looks darn marvelous , average specs money . Yet , difficulty storage makes bit pain arse deal nightly want beautiful , well made cable n't put away every day buy one . For many years I 've playing & # 34 ; Fender & # 34 ; cables ... I start problems guitar jacks connection efficiency . This guys put end problem high quality components . Best , Warranty For Life ... maybe longer . This first experience `` high end '' guitar cord playing longer I 'd like admit . For many years 've playing old shielded solid core cord without regard much besides price . In prep upcoming gig , I bought 2 Spectraflex Fatso 18 ' right angle cords . I find well made , shrink tubing sealed strain reliefs high quality plugs , thick heavy duty cabling ( think heavy ) , best , quiet , presumably superior shielding . They I consider expensive ( $ 38 ) , , well worth price , considerably less many high end cables I found read . I imagine last years . I think I eventually replace dozen cords various lengths these.J.M . Tepper This cable cool vintage look perfect , clean sound . Absolutely love ! This definitely recommendable . I 've used 3 months . No . Looks good . Works fine . No complaints . What I say ? The surprise traded little bit diameter ( Fatso part ) incredible flexibility ( ) . Looks great , noticeable noise signal loss . A really nice change stiff skinny rubber cords ! 
206	For want record ( I use Adobe Audition ) item good recording.I use use sound card . This provides smoother sound I n't worry hissing I record.You plug guitar letter I wrote Tascam : On humble advice I would forward email subsidiaries retail store sells Tascam USB audio devices ! world.Just today I got new Tascam US-100 USB audio interface . It course uses Windows audio drivers . A nightmare occured . When I plugged device Windows XP usual `` detect USB device '' come . But horror wound saying `` A hardware problem occured hardware may operate properly '' something sort.I spent 4 hours trying figure whole thing I read manual came . Tried sorts things oh brother ! It still would install . By way happened previous USB audio device , made Tascam , thing luck I found problem ! Thank God website blog ! : In c : folder must exist two files : wdma_usb.infwdma_usb.PNFIt really file important . Some software seems knock renaming : wdma_usbinf.bakwdma_usbpnf.bakI simply found files , opened renamed proper names . And lo behold I restarted computer US 100 worked ! Its easy rename files open wdma_usbinf.bakwdma_usbpnf.bak save wdma_usb.infwdma_usb.PNF.Its simple ! ! Anyone works customer service Tascam know . Like I said previous USB audio device I I woulnd selling eBay cause I 'm happy Tascam US hope helps audio work computer . And USB phone . This Tascam `` US-100 USB Audio Interface '' exactly I looking record wireless mic XLR outputs , directly PC video editing software . We professionally produce instructional videos needed `` voice '' work existing footage . Before getting convenient little unit record import PC , saves us step need record audio . Here observations : + Plug Play ; connected PC via USB instantly recognized+ USB Powered ; external power needed , big plus using Good Sound ; clean clear Inputs ; XLR , 1/4 Mic , RCA stereo line , `` Hi-Z '' : - XLR input powered ( problem us ) - Includes `` Audacity '' software , need load Recommended ! CFH Does 's job extremely well , produces high quality audio fantastic recording microphone guitar without fuzz latency . It 's built like tank , 's nice solid . This interface amazing piece beginner kit disappoint . I wo n't recommend anyone , actually used one sound card , since n't work good recording.spend money want something good . The US-100 works fine needs : rough ready audio tracking Cubase 5 64-bit Windows 7 . My PC configuration ( mixer , power mics , headphone monitoring ) .If 're buying studio setup requiring phantom power multiple inputs , 'll need separate mixer and/or standalone phantom supply . From mixer cable US-100 's line input via RCA jacks couple hiccups setup , I n't blame device . It uses stock drivers loaded right . The documentation minimal covers Vista , 's accurate 'll manage Win7 . On Windows side make USB default recording playback device onboard audio speakers ( I onboard 2.1 desktop speakers ) .I 'm using ASIO4ALL Cubase Cubase couple times configuring VST connections I/O busses . Once configured however , 's solid.I 'd recommend checking user forums particular software/platform find similar set XP machine , changing default sound devices often means hassle toggling settings launching DAW . On Win7 , I unplug US-100 , settings revert nicely desktop speakers . If I plug US-100 back , settings revert - reliable . Even better , I want use Cubase strictly MIDI , software detects change I n't reconfigure connections busses . That may function Cubase , pays research particular software.While US-100 connected , 'll hear nothing computer speakers rely upon US-100 's headphone jack audio RCA jacks . This balance control helpful . It 's pan , 's center position gain mixing computer 's output ( within DAW well outside system sounds ) direct monitoring input signal . Very simple use overdubbing . Some people may prefer hard left/right pan overdubbing : I live center mix though switch toggle true pan would terrific want desktop speaker playback tracks done , number ways go : 1 ) US-100 restart DAW . 2 ) Run cable RCA outs US-100 mini-jack aux desktop speakers 3 ) Run mini-jack extension cord headphone jack US-100 using headphone jack , RCA audio outs muted vis-versa . Rather pull headphone I would prefer push switch toggles front back output , I live without , US-100 works great long needs meet capabilities . You ca n't rely product description packaging answer . Fortunately 's enough user-information setup n't difficult track . although quality obviously studio , guy serves 's purpose dissapointed buying . use mess around garageband , good job expensive peice equipment . 's also easy use , USB cord super easy using witha laptop computer . plus , headphones listen always plus . got run instruments comp use sony acid , works well . I problems sony acid ( latency , ) I downloaded asio program cut latency , I n't use really , good I use sony recording mixing . stereo sound great , like true guitar stereo . entry level records one channel even though misleading multiple inputs outputs . It works beginner tool . mono . I 'm sick protools I wanted find something cheap easy I could afford upgrade real equipment use . This unit fit bill decent reviews I went it.I 'm using record guitar vocals trick . The problem records lot hum white noise using xlr input . I 've tried every variation possible make sure problem n't external unit . I even tested exact mic + cable input MBox protools got clean recording . I actually like unit 's `` tone '' better - seems transparent . If hum , would get 5 stars.Unfortunately , hum pretty big problem . The hum n't loud enough ruin recording one two tracks . If start layering , though , quickly white noise . I even tried moving unit onto different electrical circuit still problem.So , works rough stuff use I would n't use anything plan passing around much . This first foray home recording comes free . Free free , get pay terms something produce high qualty musical reproduction . The interface noisy , requred lot tweaking fact get reasonable sound without distorion etc . Sent back one day .

208	This theKyser one three capos I use ukulele . It works , second favorite . I park headstock ukulele , easy add , move , remove . With trigger-type release , makes one easiest quick-change capos I 've used . It feels sturdy enough ( lightweight aluminum ) . I like trigger portion sticks upwards , get way like Trigger Banjo Capo , Black . My favorite still G7th capo . This close second complaint eligible Amazon Prime . UPDATE : I saw capo eligible Amazon Prime . Free shipping Prime members ! ! ! For price quality , Kyser capo works uke . Highly recommended . works great , stays way ... cant ask much . ( expect get ) price half locally . I 've playing ukulele 3 years , I 'm new using capo . It seems hold tight . It says Banjo Mandolin ukulele first instrument listed box . It right size clamp four strings taking on/off really easy . Costs 2x much cheap capos , 's worth every single penny . THis strong clip , yet damage concert tenor ukulele necks . It ; budge clip , 's low profile . Made metal , last took one star one thing : hand clip portion sometimes get way fretting sticks neck quite ways . Some capos , like Dunlop Russell anything hit hand fretting . Sometimes I try Kyser opposite side , away , player . But , seems still hit hand chords , different ones . That said , I work around , 's lifelong capo fantastic build keeps strings buzzing ukes . If one large hands , I , interference may even issue ya . Happy strumming . Mahalo . A strong strong bigger instruments , works good ukes mandolins banjos thick neck . I several capos , one instrument . Bought Mandolin loves , works great , swear Kyser 's use guitars Kyser capos , great product , complaints price worth . Works great Baritone Ukulele . Same quality full size acoustic guitar capo . Easily fits ukulele case , . It 's cute little capo . It works great ukulele mandolin course 's hard use get higher frets frets VERY small . But works . Although capo marked correct mandolin , works correctly 3rd 4th fret mandolin . Any lower fretboard capo n't enough pressure work 1st 2nd fret position mandolin , even though mandolin fairly low action.I number Kyser capos much like style ( I least six Kyser guitar capos use guitars Taylor 12-String Fender American Strat without problems ) , case banjo capo n't work I need . Perhaps capo sent defective , although I enough decades experience stringed instruments know n't seem broken , task.From feedback others sent possible capo may work wish take chance , I know I n't time stage take 20 seconds set fussy capo 'just right ' make sure holding right hope n't start buzz middle song . I went another brand talking bluegrass guys better luck another style mandolin capo . I use capo time instruments . A friend mine saw asked order one also . I love ! I several types capos , one seems well built . A little bulky 5 string banjo especially fingering near . I really n't need change fast use little , might use performance setting ways . It 's good banjo capo . Inexpensive works well without squeezing strings tune . End story You never go wrong buying Kyser capo . They made last really designed . The great thing capo fits banjo mandolin I n't seperate capo also capo guitar made Kyser I tell works well . You never go wrong Kyser . Not I like idea 's US company . I 've cheaper capos n't job . They either n't press strings hard enough wear quickly get used much . This Kyser last long , long time . I 've using one Kyser 's good . I one usually stays mandolin works well banjo . If never used one , 's makes MUCH easier change keys although I usually use I 'm playing chords , I solo I like play open strings makes breeze pop put back . With little practice 'll able quickly without strings buzz . This nice bag price . Nicely padded ample zip compartment hold snark , capo , whatever . There handle shoulder strap . Plus , reallly nice looking bag , black little white trim front . 
209	This first noise reducer . It works like says reduces noise . comes 2 knobs 1 switch . The switch let choose want reduce noise activated mute everything activated . The 2 knobs , 1 let select range noise want reduce , one fast want start reducing noise . I noticed slight change original sound distortion , could also n't find right setup . knob noise reduce highest setting , reduce also sound guitar , really got ta study use properly . overall , price 'm happy , hides hiss sounds unwanted . I several Behringer pedals , placed Behringer board . Most B. pedals work quite well . I quality issues . Some people complain plastic cases , tough reliable unless 're habit abusing pedals smashing around ca n't control & # 34 ; stomp & # 34 ; pressure . Some better others , one works perfectly . I 6 B. pedals ( one tuner ) , seems add noise amp output , especially quiescent mode ( signal input ) .This pedal , placed end line signal goes amp , quiets noise pedals generate . I check , I first thought amp making noise , I bypassed pedals , amp quiet , relief . Then I needed relief pedal noise , trick.The controls little misleading , easy get used adjust . The & # 34 ; send-receive & # 34 ; function quieting noise send additional effects pedal , seems pointless , best way use put end chain quiet effects.The mute function may help , I turn pedal tuner , also functions little modification B. pedal board make fit , I already 6 pedals place . But , removal couple screws , fit slot meant longer pedal.I n't actually need on-off function time , placing sideways , way spot disadvantage . I leave time always quiets noise I 'm actually playing . However , I still operate necessary , example mute function I needed that.It 's aggravating pedal eliminate noise pedals , least easy solution noise gate like one . I wanted noise reducer I like 10 pedals loud feedback I getting back insane . I got one wa cheaper basically thinking ? It 's like $ 25 . It great choice . The pedal stops nearly unwanted feedback n't alter tone . It take time figure golden . It 's great . wow , simply good . price u get better deal , job perfectly . 4 far , get needed . - 's simple 's made do- well- 's know noise gate supposed think might need one , I highly recommend unit.I 'm get second one put devices loop ( Behringer units , Rat , Big Muff , etc etc ) . The one I already stay end signal chain , delays . Pretty much must-have recording , especially quiet spots : - ) Thanks unit I quiet recording setup . Cleans hum , going effects pedals , pedals make noise , n't much cleans way , keep expensive boss pedals . I think fifth Behringer pedal . Admittedly I n't time try one . But based others , I 'd say everything pedals cost double ! noise reducer pedal gets probably % noise , using distortion pedals & amazing value.100 % recommended ! ! ! ! When comes noise gates , definitely trick . It sensor , knows playing guitar , turn automatically . This means 're playing , 'll block annoying static sound guitar pedals make - start playing , 'll lower n't effect noise guitar . It 'll sound . I would recommend . Plus Behringer best brand pedals . IT job described though . I complains cheap price plus . I strat running crate amp tub preamp picked noise like mad . pedal like automatic volume knob turns input n't signal guitar . takes little playing get dialed , I keep time . nice little pedal . It effectively quiets pedals . Works advertised . Not much else say . Get one ! great money makes ur real quaiet , , soupose to.. german mind great electronics , well made plastic , It cuts buzz left pedals , price 's pretty good , badly built either . If hiss distortion compression pedals , worth money . Contrary name , noise gate rather noise reducer . It filter noise , rather stops signal amp entirely sound instrument reaches predetermined minimum . If playing humbuckers , problem pedal hiss never hear . If playing single coils , hum play noticeable still worthwhile . Whether 're gigging n't want sound like amateur 're practicing headphones , make playing sound little better , ca n't complain . This baby says reasonable price . One find cable loops one needs eliminate humming & noise , one n't know output actually making interference , 've established , 's good baby ! ! ! I 'm big fan pedals , I much prefer multi effects , say great cheap pedal . Does like noise gate rack . I 've used live since I got works great , problems . Its made plastic n't effect anything , pretty tough . It two modes , noise reduction clips noise silences note fades , mute lets mute stomp switch . I use mute mode live silence bass sets I also used reduction mode pickups noisy . Both modes work great sensitivity knob dial right clipping . Full clip notes hard sometimes register quieter notes noise clip together , less subtle . Great value great tool . I gave product 5 stars , simply exactly I bought - reduce unwanted noise amp . You play controls get exact settings clipping sustained notes want . It n't cut noise playing , comes kills noise . There two lights pedal , one comes pedal working reducing noise . If set high sensitive , recognize end sustained note noise . So play find personal setting I 'm sure every guitar pedal board unique sounds start guitar go pedal chain amp . The works soon understand best job , happy . Oh , switch Mute , works switch.. You also beat price -- -- havent used yet.. seems like nice pedal .. nice lightweight ... nice rubber lol haha ? 
210	I love strings little mellow mando strings sit mix let guitars cut though little . I 'm hoping last ! I bought cheap Rogue mandolin , setting I course replaced cheap factory strings . I put , difference . These n't heavy , light . They ring nicely . I find coating bronze strings good string cleaner , like Dunlop 65 , help avoid dirty fingers get much life strings . The J74 's sort default string mandolin dealers put instruments . They bright brassy new , give decent punch sound . However bronze , discolor fingers tarnish pretty quickly , especially summer fingers sweatier . Also , since round-wound , harder fret flat-wound string harder shift . But people like change often , like 30 days , whenever play gig , get nice bright brassy punch new . This get point work harder get volume , less elastic , less lively . One thing sure , J74 's loud zingy , 's dealers put mandolins . Some folks move heavier 's get even louder fatter woof chops . The J74 's brighter aggressive flatwound strings cut 're ensemble work . Just make sure change often get best performance . D'Addario strings become favorite guitars , two mandolins . Consistent quality good tone volume made loyal brand . What I say ? These strings sound GREAT ! They play wonderfully , work well together , nice brilliant ( tinny ) sound , excellently made . These going unwind break . That 's say . I using strings inexpensive 's Mandolin ; strings made significant difference quality tone instrument ; I strongly recommend strings . I 've never bought strings kind hard rate . So far good ! Quality strings affordable price . They made quality materials care given quality control ensure buyer good product . 
211	I Cannon brand clutch I bought one replace . What I like one release lever works . On Cannon lever vertical . This made less natural motion . With one hit stroke stick releases . That motion much natural makes easier use . An could made one easier accidentally I issue release also well made works well . It works well standard clutch , drop clutch iffy . top part spins around hit lever grab move back hit . Honestly took adjustments get right , works great.The black handle quick release used drum stick playing . After tries I got good angle hit played.Height adjustment also important . If latch high , grab hi hat bring back . Too low sound right.This replaced horrible Pulse Hi hardware shook loose every songs , I completely pleased worth $ It 's great need quickly drop hats , way around . I bought drop clutch cheap , I budget . Overall build solid , problem I clutch lock back place . good product great price works well far bought 2 price one others free ship one road one pratice This drop clutch I used years always buy model . Nothing market works well . Simple installation , allows use double bass pedals double kick closed hi hat tapping It could n't Best Buy . 's amazingly helpful double pedal licks haha ! ! 're goin pedals , use make sound like hat open OR closed ... depends want . 's really useful I recommend double pedal lot This ingenious clutch engages step hi-hat pedal , drop closed position hit lever top . This allows either ride closed hi-hats using bass pedals , yet return normal hi-hat playing music calls aware clutch two positions - open fully closed . However , way work around like partially open hi-hats closed position sizzle sound . I work around placing spring hi-hat stem , metal felt washers top spring , gives opening I drop cymbal closed . There lot trial error finding right spring cymbal pair different height mated together , I looking tiny fraction inch opening . Too small low tension spring stickwork sound . Too large stiff get sound . However , personal preference , many drummers ride fully closed hi-hat anyway , makes clutch perfect hi-hat style , using double bass , `` must '' accessory . Gibraltar 's model solid , heavy duty , engages perfectly every time .

214	I used buy lot wire form guys ... . However , need careful test everything get XLR cable tester.I n't believe ... I read another reviewer issue XLR cables wired incorrectly pin pin . So I took handy cable tester went dozen cables.I got 4 monoprice cables I found one . Now I checking sure.Not good start though.Glad reviewer made discovery passed on.I suggest everyone check cables . The testers cheap may show problems n't aware . I use cable run balanced XLR outs digital piano balanced TRS inputs audio interface . It works perfectly plenty length . I happy build quality would recommend anyone . I use cables home , hooked audio interface monitors . They appear well built sound fine . I several months working perfectly . Highly recommended price . Perfect cable using small behringer 4 channel amp plug mic slot small mixer . high quality great sound . The cable didnt work . cable . I red blinking light syndrome also . But I learned awhile back dont try fix something paid Send back . So Thanks HDE wasting time . Go sell snake oil someone else ... ... ... I wanted use cables acoustic/electric guitar . They little short ( fault though ) . They seem built well I 'd say comparison cables I 've used , sound average . These work many applications might satisfactory . If performing musician , would better look higher quality cables best sound quality lowest noise . 
215	I two , may favorite . Had another brand stopped working replaced . The one `` bad '' , lasted probably 10 years . What else say ? It 's sustain pedal 's good price free shipping cases . This pedal outstanding price . The feel great n't move put floor . The thing I disliked n't support `` half dampening '' like higher end pedals around price range.I got Christmas 2007 still going strong used every day recording studio.Great product Works great . I effect 49 Alesis midi keyboard I expensive Yamaha keyboard sustain pedal . Chrome great quality good weight 's tinny . ... u wana buy one 9.99 cheap pedals ebay n likes right ? ...

It front tag ( 30 bucks ) sp-1 14.99 I got , wrong spot , I went , got price tag , minimal drama , gave price said , pedal great . The problem people pedal , I see , say , sounds DO N'T HAVE THE SAME AS A OR SOUND . It fun playing organ sounds trying `` pump pedal '' keep sustain `` wash '' tone . thing great anyone needs pedal synth ( I casio wtk-4200 I believe ) , good need . As said , need learn release start sustain , true art . 30 bucks ? robbers . I 've used pedal Casio keyboard 6 weeks now.Pros : construction ( compared plastic footswitch type pedals come keyboards ) switch - I using Yamaha FC4 older keyboard , FC4 work properly Casio keyboards . It 's tip-negative polarity , Privia requires tip-positive polarity . So piano would operate reverse ( sustain pedal depressed ) . Thankfully , SP-2 switch bottom switch accomodate long enough ( 6 ' ) Con : quality slightly less FC4 . The FC4 smooth action ( made Japan ) , SP-2 problems metal spring squeaking . Some lubricant helped fix squeaking.The SP-2 also comes plastic cap prefer cover metal pedal . Overall , solid product almost necessary upgrade plastic footswitch pedals . Wonderful , piano feel , piano action . Will partly sustain pressed late let go reapplied briefly , n't even think keyboard sort responsivness ( cheapo Yamaha ) . This pedal buy unless need three . I future M Audio customer . This pedal nice . It looks much expensive actual price works great . You plug keyboard play . It works well . I send first one back . The second one working fine far . I 've noticed works better DAWs others , also . If problems , could DAW software . It works great Reaper . I bought M-Audio keyboard also works equally well Casio Lighted sure keyboard sustain pedal heavy duty unit feels operates exactly like sustain peddle piano . I bought sustain pedal iRig Keys Midi Controller , I On Stage pedal ( square ) , crap . This M-Audio awesome , n't move I put floor , sustains note supossed , feels well . So far 's still working , switch button use keyboard . I would buy ! ! I recently picked used Casio Privia PX-320 cheesy , little square sustain pedal slipped around terrible feel . I heard finicky third party pedals , purchased anyway . It worked ( I needed set polarity switch pedal open ) .It also worked perfectly Roland RD-300NX , I expected . What I love pedal fantastic feel rivals real piano , equal feel main reason I gave five stars addition compatibility 's built last . It 's heavy , metal exterior except bottom pad , six foot cable allows place practically anywhere . Plus price right . In fact , entire package impressive I compared models I considered . And 's light years ahead OEM pedals Casio ships Privia keyboards . If looking sustain pedal , . Built solid , feels like could withstand good beating , good since teen using . Not complaints , works reasonably priced . well made , works like charm felt like made quality material made cheap parts plastic . well built pedal good quality , enough weight keep body stable , good & # 34 ; middle travel & # 34 ; execution point sustain . With correct keyboard , pedal also allow half pedaling . important someone keyboards multiple manufacturers , especially older models ; pedal switch allow polarity adjustment ( newer keyboards n't matter , polarity edited , , alternatively , polarity sensed startup long pedal plugged ) Some pedals , particularly name manufacturers , work keyboards . That said , I feel M-audio compares favorably 's visible competition , Yamaha 's FC4 offering . The Yamaha pedal bit heavier , I like subjectively implies better quality , , reality , Yamaha last circumstances , breaking needing spot repair year road . Last , Yamaha FC4 half pedaling option polarity switch , making M-audio pedal great around case , pedal live stage , unpacked packed , tossed around fair bit , 2 1/2 years problems . This pedal works like charm . Stays place works . I would buy I needed replace Works great - good feel - carpet works well wife loves - I needed two I would buy another There n't much say keyboardist , need durable , high quality sustain pedal , BUY THIS PEDAL ! You n't really need expensive sustain pedal unless 're concert pianist playing $ nuff said . This pedal solid feel foot gives ' I expect playing live gigs . Always welcomed fact stays place I put wood carpeted surfaces . I bought 2 controllers Alesis drum machine . One starts/stops drum pattern triggers fill change pattern A B . These things stay put work every time . Beautiful pedal , nice chrome foot piece , weighted substantial feel , quiet , rubber bottom slip around . An all-around solid purchase low price I found Amazon . Love . 
216	I 've owned used product time quite happy . I notice I problems unpleasant humming introduced one time using powered speakers , I believe fault unit . I learned active speakers care input cables past certain length . For greater distances , using wireless transmitter deliver mixed sound matching wireless receiver connected speaker units solved problem completely . The FX processor works flawlessly long I remember push selector engage desired function . Very easy use . Compact size . No ability instantly mute input device turn gain . For price ... expect ? ! Soon I market upgrade ... one slider controls ability connect laptop via usb . I need xlr inputs least 7 band equalizer compressor/limiter larger gigs fairly large group accompanying instruments . Just waiting good deal . The mixer good price I return first one soon opening due loose parts moving around inside . The packing way average . As matter fact , outer box without cushioning . After seeing UPS FEDEX delivery videos I would pack UPS FEDEX shipping item poor packing . However , great seller ( I referring AMAZON ) immediately responded sent replacement along prepaid label return fist unit . Second unit similar packing damages . Worked fine . This much smaller I thought would I kinda like takes space . It exactly expected . The effects pretty good actually could used push live recording work - although certainly would replace likes TC Electronics Lexicon . Relatively transparent controls responsive . For money ... ... good value . Running 4 mics , samples odd phone call one device recording bit daunting . This mixer handles perfectly . I 'm literally knew nothing arrived ( first time I 'd ever seen mixer kind ) terms usage managed figure quickly , get hiss free , nicely , beautifully warm sounds helped make podcasting sound wonderful , professional frankly better I could imagined . I n't need ' .. stock : D I 'll get one day.I wish power button . The mixer arrived early , life-saver . I immediately put use musical venue four microphone pre-amps used three vocalists one flute , CD input connected computer playing minus track vocalists . Everything functioned well medium reverb effect performed well inputs . I looking forward using effects . This one quietest mixers I 've ever used . The range adjustability excellent . 12 channels fill quickly , I 've mixed 10 time nearly noise ( least I n't hear ) . I Behringer Xenyx 1202FX , essentially model costs 20 dollars FX ( comes 100 set effects ) . I home recording Cubase Logic , using Presonus Firebox audio interface , MIDI , vocals instruments , n't use mixing board , eventually decided try one given ( ) making reasonable prices ( b ) I inputs outputs Firebox could easily handle.This mixing board n't look impressive I first checked , set used , operates well cleanly . The fact comes four mic inputs preamps plus . The fact on/off switch minus . But basically works well , EQ useful , large number inputs outputs small mixer . Behringer makes range models less/more inputs suit one 's needs , great . Also , dedicated mixer makes easier , I leave inputs connected adjust things mixer depending I want record . Another small thing mixing button cuts line altogether -- turn zero . And , faders ( except main ) ; instead uses knobs everything . Well , I would liked things , I would pay , I really wanted functionality good price , Behringer Xenyx delivered thus far.By way , I running following mixer : AT3035 audiotechnica condenser mic , Alesis QS8.1 , guitar via line-in ( mic 'd ) , two KRK RP5 studio monitors , Presonus Firebox . Everything 's working sounding great thus far.The effects mixer useful , since I running Logic , I ever use live , I may , I 'd imagine 'd come handy . The effects so-so terms sounds : usable , great , opinion . Behringer somewhat spotty reputation among many professional musicians I bit apprehensive buying unit far , good . The mic preamps sound pretty good - clean relatively quiet . The knobs slider feel smooth well also seems send hotter signal JBL 's good thing.The built-in effects probably weakest point . I 've heard really cheap digital reverbs much smoother unit.I also wish Control Room knob outputs independent Main Output slider . That would definitely make lot practical , would also turn 4 mixer . So , shabby $ mixer I probably would n't use recording . Considering price cheap , I took chance year ago home hobbyist studio . To say I used `` rarely '' understatement - maybe month I friends jamming way get vDrums bass DI powered wedges . That said , within year two channels stopped working altogether , main volume became scratchy jumpy point volume way would = volume ALL way up.Aside working less year later , others mentioned lack power button combined wall wart adapter bit pain well . However , 're building studio budget want roll dice , 's decent little mixer works.Pass - sound quality decent price , reliability gets zero .

So I took resonator , found inch gap neck body , naturally scared , I tightened metal rod , brought neck body , brought strings perfect 's beautiful instrument , sounds pretty good , Granted , It 's Gold Tone , But sounds like banjo costs 2-3x much . The thing I would change tuning pegs , made cheap plastic , n't feel like break time soon though , I prefer metal tuning pegs . ( part holds strings still metal , I 'm talking things turn fingers tune plastic ) So , I 'm debating rating 4 stars 5 stars.. I 'd rate 4 scare gave first , I think I 'll rate 5 stars 's looks , sound , price . Yes , reviews right guys , n't skeptical , But warned may little , I neck . No worries though , Now I 'm learning new favorite instrument . ( Also , strings came pretty decent , new strings sound bit better ) My banjo arrived couple days I ordered .

First , I love Crybaby 535Q I recommend wah pedal . I tell wah pedal story.Several years ago , I bought Crybaby GCB-95 , even though I use wah much time , I think shop twice get repaired within year . Fortunately , never gave gig , matter time . Finally , I gave stopped using wah pedals couple years ago , I bought Digitech whammy wah , mainly whammy effects learn Morello 's style . Since digital wah patches available , I started use happy n't treadle break like GCB-95 . The wahs usable , sound I supposed play Alice , `` Man Box '' Digitech going cut . So , time get real wah . I searched around YouTube demos talked people see used . I chose 535Q people told 've never maintenance problem , versatile.You get several kinds wah sounds tweaking dials , great suggestions manual get started . I set mine setting left I mainly use wah playing early alternative 90s hard rock styles . That setting works songs like , `` Bulls Parade '' well , including create white noise scratch DJ sounds.I still use wah pedals terribly often , nice reliable wah whatever I need simply adjusting couple knobs . I think long I need wah pedal , one suit needs many styles , I think remain pedalboard years ! It definitely one consider , price bad . 
221	What I say ? These probably well-known pads available probably best . This best price I could find Amazon arrived described via prompt shipping . Ok , I installed things KRK 6 's ( stands ... sitting two speakers ) . What I say ? The bass , previously disappeared studio , present ! My monitors sounded kinda thin I losing much energy desk , things made ton difference ! My stereo image even feels wider ! Sure , 're little pricy , hey ... THEY WORK ! If 's want charge , people continue buy , I 'm cool ! I 'm happy reults $ 40 got ! 5/5 ! These really work great . No desk vibrations sound monitors clear . I wish could found smaller size since way bigger 5 '' monitors . If anyone knows get smaller ones let know . Thanks ! I 'm using angle speakers addition isolating desk surface . Unfortunately , angle speakers default , I cutting rearranging , worked . If need cut fit speakers , try find something better scissors , 's quite hard cut foam evenly . These pretty amazing . I recently purchased Desk I feeling I would need pads must amateur recording studio setup little acoustic treatment . Sitting monitors speakers pads produce even better quality sound experience also get rid unwanted bass vibrations desk . I love use extra pads angle way want set . These pads make bookshelf speakers sound AMAZING . It 's like I 'm using actual studio monitors . At $ 40 , ca n't go wrong pads studio . It MUST . These laser cut pads studio monitors . I feel vibration hard drive spinning desktop sounds coming speakers . And look professional . Just I needed Home Studio Monitors sit table next Computer DAW system , surprised many different versions I sent , work well thanks ... ... The reviewer wrote `` cheap foam '' worth $ 5.00 , n't understand appreciate quality speaker isolators . A/B $ 5.00 cheap foam realize good Auralex isolators work . I using pair Behringer Truth active speakers weigh 33 pounds . These isolators support well solved big problem I . It seems speakers `` audio coupling '' console placed making console vibrate spaekers muddy lower problem started I noticed mixes sounded good systems except bass frequencies around . Apparently Behringer speakers accurately reproducing range I EQing range badly compensate . I n't hear I mixed Hafler speakers . I give Behringer Truth speakers I really thought sounded excellent every frequency detailed every range . The Behringers also power I needed ( active speakers ) played really loud studio without distortion . Except I describe muddy clearly detailed low end , I love speakers . Fortunately I friends studio ( great pro studio ) I saw using Auralex speakers . He said loved . I bought placed speakers remixed project I working . WOW ! ! What difference . It immediate difference . The bass nicely detailed muddy tone longer . I reajust EQ lower frequencies ( cut back almost flat ) new mix . I immediately bought 2nd set small Hafler speakers . Why take chance also reproducing accurately . These isolators great product problem solver saved buying new speakers discovering I still problem . `` Cheap foam '' ? ? I n't think . Some argue necessary monitors , however somebody worked music half life , I assure , whereas 're life death , make significant improvement listening process , especially project studio . No , 're going make music sound better , give detailed accurate bass response monitoring . Even cooler fact pads come 2 extra pieces padding essentially let customize position monitors angle ever-so-slightly . Lastly , although monitors fit perfectly pads , I ca n't help think monitors larger , I would need second pair , especially positioned horizontally . All , overpriced ; really make world difference .

Will confess I 'd like 12-string , 's another new inexperienced acoustics able really define sonic quality guitar compared expensive models ( I 'm electric guy ) , ignorant state , 's 5 stars without hesitation.I need set , however , stock strings mine poor condition . Do n't recall I purchased Amazon . In event , $ 30- $ 50 trip luthier new strings , felt like guitar far excess $ 100 . It stayed tune quite nicely , I often change tunings ( standard , mostly Eb , occasional full step , Open D , G others ) fret buzz , I love feel neck .

I hope information help make informed choice guitar purchase . I 've played guitar number years , professionally , time I 've owned guitars Fender , Gibson , Ovation , B.C . Rich , Yamaha Applause . That said , admittedly , guitar purchased intention cheap , guitar reasonably playable , I could take I go camping .

Out box , fit matte finish impressive . The neck action nicely set , intonation spot-on guitar rich sound tone . The tuning pegs work smoothly guitar stays tune nicely . Note I changed strings set provided set gauge strings personal preference guitar features black pick guard shown product photos . The Jasmine S34C NEX truly impressive guitar price .

This guitar I would recommend anyone . I trying get friends buy one acoustic guitar , lol . Thank You ! ! ! ! ! ! I played guitar nearly 50 years , wanted inexpensive small-body steel-string guitar keep practice noodling . This one fills bill pretty well . Build quality quite good ( made Indonesia , China I expected ) , intonation perfect . The finish hard matte surface probably wear well . A pick guard present , I removed plastic shipping protector , entire guard came . The adhesive residue comes right , I play guitar without pickguard . light -- entire guitar light . The body bit larger lower bout I expected , sits lap comfortably take issue reviewers ' suggestions would good beginner guitar right box . The string spacing nut narrower width neck , fingers . The nut replaced one spaces strings across fingerboard little . The action may lowered shaving bridge saddle carefully , little time . This work cost much guitar cost take luthier , , improve playability instrument.The strings supplied guitar tinny cheap , I replaced set D'Addario EJ-16 Light . The improvement tone immediate -- little guitar sounds pretty darn good . All , careful modification , good guitar beginner casual player , acceptable one experienced guitarist little modification . As beginner playing guitar I looking something mid range . It holds tune failed yet . Since I starting gets lot use practice . As I get better I upgrade.So far maintenance tune clean strings normal . I n't played guitar number years decided get back . Having carpal tunnel surgery months ago , small hands begin , I started researching guitars narrow necks . The Jasmine Takamine kept coming really good reviews , I decided give try , buying S34C . Firstly , delivered promptly requested , arrived pristine condition , really nice strings . It lovely honey gold finish front body , attracted guitar first place . I really appreciate cutaway . How many high notes I hitting baby ? Who knows , looks WAY cool , LOL ! The craftsmanship , least unpracticed eyes , looks superb . I n't crazy pickguard lettering , finally figured lettering sticker could easily removed . And sound ... lovely , ringing tonality one would expect steel string guitar , lovely mellow tones needed well . I wonderful guitar , I 'm taking online video lessons learning storm chords fingering techniques ! Hey , I n't expect Leo Martin anytime soon , I 've got something shoot , need dream ! If 're looking great guitar reasonable price , look . Oh , reason I gave four stars cuz neck really n't seem narrow . But , maybe 's small hands . little finger , I barely reach octave piano . And ya go ! I n't one , playing sister-in-law 's last year visiting . Did n't know much guitar , quite impressed sound workmanship . Changed strings , , action little high , 's good anything I 've played $ 500 . I honestly thought cost around $ 350 , I quite surprised seeing sale less $ 100 . It 's definitely great value.In part experience guitar , I purchased Takamine G Series 12-string last year , ( considerably money ) , 's simply incredible . Bought Takamine 40 years ago . It exceptional guitar I paid $ 125 . , would $ 800 I bought got superb machine money . Simply superb . It 's old Takamine , negative differences slight , two three days acquaintance guitar.The first finish good . The sanding coats skimped , means finish front texture ; sides guitar also bit rough.The second probably flows first . The tone touch wooden ; n't sing old : intonation true twelfth fret , playable ( enjoyable play ) slide . After first tune-up strings , stayed tune.For price , guitar superb introduction playing.A young child , small woman , find guitar bit large deep true playing comfort . For everyone else , fit pretty intonation true twelfth fret , playable ( enjoyable play ) slide . After first tune-up strings , stayed tune.Any beginner , intermediate players , pleased guitar . I bought deployment shipped amazon . I n't planning using anything practice guitar . The way military , I figured fifty percent chance would arrive flattened box wooden splinters sticking , I took chance anyway . It arrived intact , ready play . The strings bit cheap , guitar well made , really nice rich tone . I planning giving away I left , I shipping home instead , wioll cost almost price guitar mail home , worth . This one worked well I taking chance 12 string , soon arrive . It 's kind pointless add yet another review item already received hundreds ( mostly ) positive reviews already . But I ca n't help - I like guitar . Quite simply , really nice guitar . Is $ 750 nice ? No . But less $ 100 , nice n't even describe it.My Jasmine arrived well packaged including double . The outside box little damage , guitar well protected inside , problem.Since I 'd read reviews flaws finish , one first things I check thoroughly . Nope , flaws noticeable . Kind satin `` laid back '' finish feels good looks nice . Oh , I immediately remove pick guard . It peeled without damaging finish underneath ( opinion ) looks better without reviews complained too-low action . But mine seems dead . Of course action height personal preference hard fast rule . But even , 's really way anyone could characterize mine mentioned rusty strings . Not mine . The strings looked fine , usual breaking period maintained tune well.And course guitar sounds good . Again , maybe $ 750 good , least $ good . And certainly better I expected sound price.So , want nice sounding , decent looking , inexpensive guitar - 've found . Stop wasting time . Just click buy button . I bought son thousand dollar Epiphone limited edition electric guitar birthday months ago , told would like acoustic guitar Christmas , I told expensive one went local music store tried several models kept coming back one . The sound absolutely fabulous , much better current acoustic guitar cost twice much one.The store manager told us price guitar beat bought one son well . In opinion , good brands costing three times much . I 'm sure Takamine making quality guitars little money , 're looking starter guitar , looking add another guitar collection , would make excellent choice.I inspected guitar took home found places finish quite smooth rest guitar , overall quality sound beat price.We also went cutaway version son easier access higher frets vs. theJasmine Takamine S35 Acoustic Guitar , Natural . Has good sound . Stays tune . Wish came darker grain wood . A little bulky , My arm goes sleep sometimes extended playing , wish little thiner . I bought I wanted cutaway decent price . A value half . If need beater . It plays great , great fret job solid tone . Have recommended several students . This guitar pays better 3 times value ! I got tired flying guitar everytime I go visit parents . Besides risk guitar , cost . For price I paid guitar , I money ahead two visits parents . I shipped parents I bought , keeping future visits . It much better tone I expected , good action . Stays tune well . I happy purchase . friends need second guitar beach tailgate party . Love , love bit modify bridge make great sound gave ( brand strings use ) also great every recommended starters , intermediate pro player.Get one love . I thrilled guitar arrived even I tuned began guitar absolutely beautiful . The finish flawless . And 's got new guitar smell ... pick guard ( shown photo website catalog ) pleases . It would shame scratch surface strumming heavier pick . I read one review music vendor 's website reviewer complained Takamine Jasmine printed pick guard . And right ... I found easy remove words simply peeling protective sticker . strings little heavier I like I 'll changing weeks anyway.The sound craftsmanship anything would expect affordable guitar everything 'd expect pay . It rich , full bodied sound.I Takamine fan . As title says:1 ) High ) compared Mitchell think Mitchell good 's price.You compare guitar center . well.. First , I I know anything guitar ... I saw people complain corroded strings buzzing frets ... Mine came yesterday I afraid would issue , I brought school let professor checked It surprised mine issue all.. The string corroded , I changed mine anyway . The fret issue all.. Truss rod adjustment The action low guitar structure perfect . When professor starts playing , surprised sound produced . He thought guitar cost $ 300 ! ! ... He also bought one morning ... haha ... anyways , I buy amazon packaging great ! ! ... My guitar comes perfect condition , I strongly recommended guitar anybody ! ! ... Right box guitar flawless . I played strings came ( inspect buzz etc . old strings would work set-up needed ) intonation ( harmonics 12 fret exactly matched fretted note 12th fret ) dead . Absolutely fret buzz even 21st fret . I playing guitar 40 years I seen fair share acoustic guitars time . To say beautiful playing sounding instrument n't justice . I played many expensive acoustic guitars n't sound play well even set-up . The lows nice clear highs clear without sounding `` tinny '' banjo like . A well built , great sounding guitar . For price ca n't go wrong . I would recommend guitar novices pros . I expecting guitar quality low price . 100 % satisfied . Rock Jasmine ! !

230	Just bag guitar stand . No big deal , sure makes easier I stuff lug around . I love Hercules guitar stands , n't like stay put folded . This takes care problem couple bags . Sturdy material , nice draw string close . Shoulder strap works fine . Glad I bought . I love carry bags ! They allow easily carry multiple guitar stands , music stands , etc , . Who could n't use extra arm two moving equipment ? Well made fair price , ! Do Hercules guitar stand ? Then make transporting easy . It seems like gimmick , I two stands 's nice able grab using bag straps , still able carry gear hand . If full folding single stand works quite well ones rounded neck one piece hinge bit tight length . OK quality good stands fantastic . I n't understand people spend thousands even hundreds guitar buy 8 dollar stand see guitar fall get damaged neck . If pay attention prices really get great deals Amazon ... untouchable deals ... Tis makes little awkward carry . Overall though trick giving something store stand carry show show .

Now I plug mic either way , gives versitility Works well 's clean noise , 'm starting find even price low mean 's good . Whats love , inexpensive , 's job ... reading rather poor reviews , I checked signs poor quality workmanship ... Only thing I found pin rockrd bit ... three screws body I used screwdiriver tighten up.. .I suspect complaints falling apart could missing loose screws ... Not much chore .

Bought adapt mike plug 1/4 '' jack mike plug regular amp grandkids `` karaoke '' . Useful connecting mics guitar amp directly computer 's mic jack . The 1/4 '' side tends become bit loose , sure affects performance though . As digital realm audio realm become one things like become increasingly rare . You always find place keep times though.That alone good enough reason keep stuff like around . The Shure XLR Female Male 1/4 '' Adapter simply another one fix gadgets sound mixer 've got bag work like supposed to.Now one pictured mono version , would use take balanced unbalanced mic unbalanced 1/4 '' jack . If need keep balanced feed running stereo two channel single cable , adapter work . You 'll need TRS ( tip , ring , sleeve ) balanced version adapter . I purchased interface XLR plug Sennheiser E825-S mike input guitar amplifiers . seemed work well role . It well-constructed , connecting points working precisely securely.Somewhat fact , I started worrying whether I instead gotten adapter impedance matching capabilities . I 'm hardly professional technician area , I enough research figure good working answer : ( low impedance ) microphones ( say , ohms less ) generally matched solid-state amplifiers , likely Hi-Z ( high impedance ) inputs range 10,000 ohms . These amplifiers generally designed accommodate impedance ratio ( load source ) . I signal loss arrangement range decibels , ears tell : adapter works fine without impedance matching . I ca n't say sure whether also holds tube amps update review I chance find : since I wrote initial review , I discovered Pyle seems problem securing connectors properly set screws .

At price , telling quality control like I wrote another review type item , buy 3 one fails , 're still ahead game .

These little mic connectors doctor ordered , allowing spare wear tear systems mic jacks ; I simply unplug cord adapter instead . And , produce audible hum circuit . They unbalanced jacks , though ( note single black band end plug , ) need balanced jacks system ( two black bands , ) make sure take account ordering . By way , I audible difference whether singing recording . Just saying ... 
234	Works perfectly . Nice feel seems sturdy . You remember turn keyboard foot otherwise switches polarity opposite want . This inexpensive , sturdy sustain pedal I immediately buy every time I get new Yamaha keyboard - This pedal feels similar damper pedal acoustic piano - much better footswitch . Only issue due way different manufacturers configure plug polarity , may may work properly keyboards ... Great Yamaha keyboards . Fits works well . Very adequate construction , last many hours playing home ! I bought pedal replace one working Yamaha Motif , simple easy set , plugged worked fine , complaints . It 's great sustain keyboard . Well constructed pedal , nice addition recording studio . This pedal works Yamaha Motif , main concern ordering . No review stated , I figured I would mention next guy gal orders caused ordering ( I hate returning things ... LOL ) , I professional musician , keyboard player , keyboard collector ( mostly vintage poly analog , also ton mono , , built kit units ( shrugging , ) etc - lot pedal , however , I live life person surrounded keyboard instruments I use make living . purchased every brand style pedal ( purpose , 'll stick sustain . ) units , heavier I find point sustain engages right comparing electronic acoustic . It on/off switch , half modeling , The reason I gave unit 4 stars instead 5 Yamaha decided include polarity switch perhaps 20 % market get home , n't thought check , may stuck wi pedal sustains used stops sustaining pressed . A backward sustain pedal fun . Many manufacturers include simple polarity reverse switch would eliminate potential days , keyboards option switch polarity internally either thru global sensing whether pedal engaged startup adjusting accordingly ( never press sustain pedal turning keyboard , may well cause issue n't expect confused - turning without pedal depressed clear everything cases . ) So - build quality , excellent . Durability - excellent ( I 've bunch cheaper pedals - used stage - break switch point jack ) , Yamaha . Design - older pedals used flip rubber footrest supposed make pedal secure- I n't see much anymore , , long n't glossy hardwood , stay I place issue.I 've read reviews give pedal bad rating appears change global setting keyboard , something similar , All sustain pedal momentary contact switch , engaged contact made depressing circuit , disengaged pedal released . There electronics - - n't work , three points look 1 ) unscrew jack sure wires coming pedal connected metal posts inside housing . There usually two wires differing color . one disconnected , pedal cease function ( , rare instances , cause keyboard sustain notes indefinitely . This easily corrected soldering iron bit solder - jacks points strain n't wire could come disconnected . 2 ) The switch either adjustment damaged . The switches Yamaha pedals good quality unless received faulty part , would unlikely wear normal use . I , however , needed take pedal apart made adjustment . easy quick fix , even limited tools . The third option 3 ) keyboard change global setting causing pedal operate reverse . This corrected consulting owners manual reading whether keyboard software polarity & # 34 ; switch & # 34 ; , senses startup , pedal simply stopped working altogether - nothing At - # 1 2 problem jack keyboard ( HIGHLY unlikely , ,but I 've seen ) . Hopefully helps posted questions.To conclude - nice pedal money , much better build m-audio ( decent , nice Yamaha - certainly bad unit ) stage ( ca n't get mic stands right , I n't trust even basic electronics ... ) . Does Yamaha quality . The price seems good get pedal . I using Yamaha board . 
235	I HEAVY Epiphone EB-0 bass strap life-saver . Nice , thick padded doesnt look dorky . The little pocket pick practical though pick easily falls lost . I 've gigging musician almost 20 years , well made , comfortable guitar/bass strap I 've ever used.Pros : - padding need it- Perfect stitching- Heavy , stiff leather ends- Soft , material - coarse nylon find cheap straps- lined even softer material - makes strap comfortable even without shirt Did I mention 's super comfortable ? Cons : - None speak . Seriously . It 's whether 're rocking Strat 6-string bass.I use 5-string bass , makes feel like bass part . I hardly notice I 'm actually wearing strap decent set strap locks , could easily last 10 years.You sorry purchase . Having Epiphone SG G-400 , I really like strap comfortable also provides enough friction keep guitar place without much effort . Leather straps good , , tend slide strap button . I bought one heavier replacement strap love . I use particular bass slap usually hang bass higher others good slap technique . This strap adjusts well padding right place Strap ! The strap adjustable ends , front adjustment slider sat right shoulder . I cut glued material back together , 's great . Padding wide material make standing heavy bass whole lot less tiring . I purchased 3 guitar straps main guitars . I absolutely love ! Great quality , strong , great variation length . They also wide nice shoulders . I highly recommend strap ! Bought one , tried P-bass , loved . Returned Amazon bought additional one Jazz Bass ... love . Good product good price , comfortable . Update : I ordered 3rd one , time another P-bass I picked . The gripe I think ( 's super picky ) another review mentioned strap 's padding design n't really allow bass way high position . If 're person hangs base chin may problem strap , , killer product killer price . I bought strap use acoustic bass rather , - A Tacoma 4 string , bit adjustment worked great . Then I bought ovation 12 string roundback ( roundback deep dish ) I needed strap make bad boy sit I , I grabbed strap bass gave shot . After adjusting difference size worked great . Now I 'm buying another strap I one either guitar . ( I usually keep strap guitars cases allow , sure beats taking putting ) This strap comfortable acoustic/electric guitar , probably bass supporting less weight . Due width strap distributes weight larger area , meaning less pressure specific area . This makes comfortable.I might change guitar straps 2 '' 3 '' I 've taste n't comfortable playing , distracted removes creative moment . This helps keep moment groove n't cost fortune , plus holds pick two.I like phat strap fine . I like 3 & # 34 ; wide bass . Fits nice made well . Seems secure fit ( leather holders thick ) . I got couple accommodate different strap locks I different bass . The fact wide nice . As others said need slide padding , ca n't beat money . Planet Waves makes good stuff . Take load shoulder old Jazz bass , get padded 3 inch wide strap . It 's long enough allow bass rest arm 's length . I adjust fit acoustic guitar , I hold much higher , check little ' . I like well enough I four . This bass strap really comfortable great price . BTW , 's I say , n't MAKE type . This strap great I glad find well made wide strap . This Bass strap spreads weight even reduces shoulder back pain , loves . Just job . It 's fancy , 's well though , ca n't beat value . The edges n't cut neck , adjustments ends allows adjust exactly want . Like others , I unstitch pick holder pocket order provide greater range adjustment . The foam position never problem slide want , enough go buckles needed . Excellent frills product good enough cushioning bass . I pleased strap low price . I bought large body & # 34 ; F & # 34 ; hole electric guitar . 
236	Works fine . Except bottom part ( supposed support guitar ) swivels . Not sure 's . But I 'm picky know nothing guitar stands maybe 's supposed . The material 's made good , holds guitar . The things n't like 2.1 ) Each corners cap . The one bottom actually put guitar comes off.2 ) The part bottom looks like U ( used hold guitar ) spins ...

A good price , good buy . Glad I invested . By way , I read several reviews said `` smell '' ... Mine . I wonder people encountered ? In life mostly get pay . This stand really n't exception . Getting pay though n't mean wo n't need . This stand light weight inexpensive . The great thing , n't need heavier fancy exactly needs . It 's great choice someone looking keep guitars becoming damaged sit waiting played . Even though get damaged laying around still easily accessible play opposed stored $ 10 pop afford one every guitar . Putting display allowing handy urge strikes play . You excuse expensive ( cheap ) guitar get beat laying around . It supposed . I really like bottom adjustable gets guitar higher lower floor needed . A great price good item . It 's really hard beat product price . I found sturdy , well built , great fit guitar . I really appreciate low , wide stance , great insurance accident prone guitar players ! Forgot came strap secure guitar stand ... ... Doubt I 'll use strap.. I probably try use way . 's semi-secure hard floor , together I pretty unsatisfied stand . The bottom piece way lock place , although guitar stable , I comfortable enough risking wonderful guitar something rather flimsy ... I prefer one mounted wall stable overall . This one ? Meh . Not worth purchase opinion ... . Better I expect , , , I going order 2 ... stable , , easy assemble nice price .. Not perfect solid stand . tipping toss guitar onto way I . And bottom part holds guitar n't fixed 's good bad . Good 'll hand nearly shape guitar odd angles . Bad toss guitar onto way I , sometimes swings around annoyingly . 8 string , 6 string , acoustic , held sturdily year I 've And works well . My concern shaft holds weight plastic metal . I n't know long last . I might find tube place make hole . But price right stand solid enough . All areas touch banjo guitar protected last .

It 's got great tone , much better black one I 3-4 yrs . ago . I 40 watt Blues Deluxe reissue compared side side I say sound , similar , speaker , BJ much said fat switch really makes lot difference taking solo . I actually surprised much fattens tone , n't last one . This pedal works great , It feels solid n't make audible clicking noises I hear engaging . 
238	I 'm sure else say . The picks work well n't wear easily . I like nice grip fingers get sweaty n't slide . last forever ! much better plastic ones , especially stay light thickens . ! The MM pick right amount flexibility without around like thinner picks . And dunlop nylon standard first choice mountain dulcimer playing . I know people use yogurt containers , credit cards , bird even coffee stirrers picks , , consistency Dunlop pick ca n't beaten . And price right , ! I use Dunlops . For number reasons . First , texture plastic gives good sound , easier hold . Second , `` grippy '' texture put makes easier hold . Thirdly , make many sizes , right occasions . Two thumbs ! Perfect fit . I n't like pick stiff , I like grip . My hands sweat lot I really need grip . Durable affordable . The .60mm perfect thickness looking strum occasionally pick . I 'm DADGAD guitarist . These picks cut string really nicely , great driving rhythms . I 'm starting lean towards Tortex .5mm , though -- I think roughness surface Dunlops adds little bit scratch sound I n't like . Still , great picks . I 've used .60mm .73mm Dunlop Nylon picks entire professional music career . I rock hard . Acoustic , electric , Bass ! I 've tried almost every pick market break far easily . Dunlop 's Nylon picks n't break , find thickness fits needs , 'll find excellent string attack easily kept grip . I rarely ever drop one picks preforming . Maybe 5 times entire career . Buy picks . Pretty flexible due 0.60mm thickness , I would recommend Dunlop Max Grip picks picks . The Max Grips much better click YES review helpful , encourage continue writing updating reviews , leave comment questions , I happy answer I help . I like flexible pick .60mm work fine . They also good color n't stand much . 'm beginner play guitar time play strumming church praise team . play faster songs , thick gauge picks easy lose . like play thin gauge picks . used ( white ) one want make guitar sound brighter . pick gray one played last sunday worship , made sound desired would n't fly away hand plying fast praise songs . As vast multitude guitar players solemnly agree , experienced search personal Holy Grail guitar picks . I exception . dozens makers , styles , shapes , gages , materials , price ranges , ( oh ya , 30 dollar picks ) , name , I 've tried ( even nail picking metal strings ) . Now new & # 34 ; perfect pick quest & # 34 ; , must understand picks subjective scent , personal grip , sound interaction , host music making Grail different . However , play light acoustic ( main Aria tenor guitar ) , check Dunlops .60 within Dunlop line , I tried different grips thickness gages , said done , relatively cheap picks remained standing first choice . Just heavy enough heard unplugged without folding pick around thumb , light enough strum without yanking lighter strings , right material keep low strings thumping high strings singing . Even Dunlop Nylon Max grip .60 gage n't acoustically perform quite same.Would I try another pick chance presented ? Sure , us would since quest Holy Grail never truly ends , , Dunlop 's .60 Nylon without hesitation closest thing I gotten pick perfection . These happen always keep .46mm .60mm .73mm sizes hand . ( mostly use .60 's ) I 've using years probably never change . I like ' ... . I hate smooth cheap keep trying different ones find one like . 
239	This product almost zero documentation box Akai Pro website . support also almost zero . Akai seems care getting new users speed products . Customer service basically `` If ask , buy '' .

243	I 've owned TS808 since I purchased used 80s around $ 20 . Yes , great overdrive . This pedal many famous users used many iconic recordings . Pair strat run amp verge breakup - 're tone heaven . But plain truth : tons pedals - fraction cost 808 reissue . This original means last word overdrives . I dirt boxes one iconic 's transparent versatile . There hump ' EQ pedal either sits well playing n't . I 'm glad I mine I n't think I 'd shell charging days reissue . If I mistaken TS9 TS7 modded circuit less 25 cents parts 15 minutes time . If pedal came $ 100 mark would deserving five stars . I really hate burst anyone 's bubble SRV 's tone really fingers . And ; ) Years ago I owned original edition TS808 ; I loved pedal used years stage . Eventually I sold many years later , I always missed pedal , I decided give reissue try . My verdict : Awesome - It sounds like I remember . The TS808 something ' really brings nice smooth overdrive sound , especially 's enhance overdrive sound may already . I used one hybrid tube amp solid state I hear work either tube solid state amplifiers . It really gives amplifier warm overdriven sound . This pedal used boost guitar sound solos certain guitar parts . This pedal three preamp settings : , Hot , + , Turbo . It 's great solos warm blues rock rhythm guitar . One nice thing responds well soft hard pluck strings . For example : set `` Turbo '' setting pick fingers clean nicely . If pluck hard make smooth distorted sound . If want metal sound , I recommend Metal Zone MT-2 Metal Zone Overdrive Distortion Pedal There reason number one best selling guitar effect pedal market . The Tube Screamer works . : - ) If need tube screamer . You ca n't go wrong TS808 . The reason n't get , n't right tone . I say ca n't say anything bad pedal . It sounds amazing . It might sound . I personally went TS808 compliments amp better TS9 . People say better TS9 vice versa choosing wrong wording . They prefer . It 's better . Both great . To start , full name pedal would indicate , pedal tube amps . I ca n't comment 'll sound hybrid , experience 's definitely solid state . Distortion pedals go much better solid state . Further , tube screamers n't meant take tube amp clean high gain ; , 's distortion pedal . Tube screamers general designed drive tubes little harder , commonly used solo boost . Tube screamers category `` overdrive '' pedals , like name would indicate , 're meant add little extra `` '' already `` driven '' amp , natural , smooth , organic way distortion pedal would.HOWEVER , Ibanez TS-9dx typical tube screamer . The extra knob switches ts9 , + , hot , turbo mode adds whole lot tone use options . Let expound : I play hard rock metal Bugera 1990 head ( basically Marshall JCM 900 ) cab celestion vintage 30 speakers . While amp fair amount gain bass tap , 's quite enough accurately get modern tones unaided . A standard Ibanez TS-9 knock-off tube screamer able get amp like mine modern , heavier tones , standard tube screamers also slightly cut bass add mids , , help solos cut mix . But extra knob ibanez ts9dx solves problem . By switching + , hot , turbo mode , pedal adds bass little extra gain incrementally . I like `` + '' setting best . So way I use pedal I 'll set amp standard crunchy rhythm tone gain amp already fairly high . Then , songs utilize little heavier sound , I 'll kick ts9dx , drive pretty low ( 9 o'clock ) , volume 12 o'clock , tone 1 o'clock , + mode . With settings increases bass general thickness tone , adds little gain volume . So 's basically like adding another channel amp.I add one detail might make break pedal : tubescreamers general , certainly Ibanez ts-9dx , add mid-range tone automatically . And ca n't dial . The regular ts-9 mode adds low mids , little high mids . The modes add low mids particular , part contribute overall `` thickness '' tone , great . But 're scooped mid sound , say metal , I would recommend pedal solo boost , mids help cut conclusion , 's probably safe say people buy tubescreamers probably playing blues sort looking boost volume maybe add little dirt . And yes , pedal . So BBE , behringer tube overdrive , mxr distortion plus , Boss SD-1 , digitech bad monkey , several ibanez tube screamer pedal variations . But adding turbo-mode options , Ibanez TS-9dx work hard rock metal players ( depending exact style ) way plethora options wo n't . This unit like old blue jeans . exist pedals , 's produce vintage overdrive match everything ...

I bought capo I could leave clipped acoustic 's head use needed . No dice . Neck thick . It 's Washburn dreadnaught . We 're talking funky 7 string jazz line : It 's cheap dirt make work n't mind place right . My advice , spend bucks buy one 's easy . It job .

The rubber pad flat capo works well guitars flat fret board . I n't know well would work guitar curved radius fret board . I 'm thinking may hold high low `` E '' strings sufficiently keep buzzing .

I really n't long enough see stand test time , title review reads : `` So far , So good '' It 's reasonably priced I 'm pleased . I rate 5 stars . It 's well worth money .

245	This , far favorite pedal pedal board , know somethingi hate first , solid state amp , one sounded like crap ( sorry bad word ) , got tube amp , , like really really recomend one . Excellent stomp box . You dial right get SRV sound . Very sturdy well made . A must blues player . For money tremendous pedal . The next step might new MXR Bonamassa tube pedal almost double price . By way Bonamassa use pedal albeit fairly old one ... maybe maxon made version . I doubt much difference ... Very well made useable effective tone controls unlike pedals I find click ends adjustments middle area modest . It great I kinda like great look . You really watch prices cause fluctuate fair bit . It gone 10 percent weeks.. If need tube screamer . You ca n't go wrong TS9 . The reason n't get , n't right tone . I say ca n't say anything bad pedal . It sounds amazing . It might sound . I personally went TS808 compliments amp better TS9 . People say better TS808 vice versa choosing wrong wording . They prefer . It 's better . Both great . First , great , classic pedal shaped tones rock blues artists musical map . It 's actually reissue pedals Ibanez made 1980 's , though 's debate whether modern circuitry retains original tone . In opinion , unless 're purposefully picky elite trained ears , would never able tell difference . The construction sturdy ( metal actually BOSS pedal ) . The LED light , reason , difficult see angle , 's largely irrelevant let 's clear `` Tube Overdrive '' pedal n't . This NOT distortion petal like Boss DS-1 Metal Zone ( MT-2 ) . It also `` fuzz '' pedal like would hear Jimi Hendrix song . It meant heavy rock/metal/grunge type music . If need heavy distortion sloppy playing , TS9 you.What DOES , however , boost signal front end , essentially results dynamic done additional gain . This result midrange-heavy `` blues '' tone ( Ray used quite bit ) , even nice `` crunch '' overdrive tone ( AC/DC ) rhythm work . Some guitars use simply boost signal without adding bunch additional gain . It also works well distortion pedals purpose.Long story short - Ibanez TS9 Tubescreamer really one versatile pedals use - n't expect create every range sounds need right box . For cheaper alternative , consider Digitech 's surprisingly good `` Bad Monkey '' overdrive pedal , half price gives control tone . I 've also compared BOSS 's BD-2 Blues Driver , excellent , different style overdrive . ( The BD-2 much hotter output aggressive ; Tubescreamer subtle works midrange retaining underlying clean tone responding picking style ) . If start good amp guitar setup , Tubescreamer sound great . It wo n't completely transform tone , give current tones boost , make solos really sing rhythm chords really crunch . I bought unit friend , I could compare others overdrives I already . I think MXR Badass Custom Modified Overdrive Way Huge Green better choise .

I n't think due poor quality equipment , I think due frustration lack information provided customers sale . Neither Behringer website included documentation items I bought adequate customers like sound experts . EXACTLY I needed . Small , compact , functional , works ! No off/on power switch though small consideration think . Connect mics , , MP3 players ... control sound volume , fingertips ! This mixer perfect price specified . Although blue LED power light near blinding ; overall quality functionality product would suggest anyone budget would want good quality mixer .

252	I LOVE mic indoor studio mic . I would use location high level background noise picks quite lot extra noise . But conditions quiet like studio , mic . Clean , warm sound picks natural bass really well . Good vocals ( singing ) , instruments like guitar piano . Also used minor podcasting worked well ! Comes dB limiter ( ) switch , right mic . Works really nicely limiting background noise.I would highly recommend especially price . Comes decent hard case SWEET shock mount . Very happy overall . love ! im using mic record vocals home made demos , works awesome . quality price , im satisfied ! Best sounding vocal mike bucks . I tried many MXL mikes ( 200 ) one came close . Unfortunately , top end n't defined AT2035 NT1-A . So I ended forking 2x much going latter . Love little guy ! I previously using Blue USB Snowball . This sounds much fuller real . These microphones made studio , I used live performance , better good PA System enjoy sound , everything video showed , 's great microphone period . Top line works great , thank Marshall Electronics Amazon . For years I 've owned nice AT4033 .

253	like title says . item 's supposed . get headroom expect 20 dollar item . I love ability separate control inputs . I 've months I 'm experiencing noise pots , I n't expect . I thought would 've lasted little longer . I open clean pots , I expected little life . battery operation would 've nice like I said , supposed , well enough I 've bought 2 . Was great problem solver almost exactly one year getting volume died . Useless . I used `` line '' input ( tap aux feed got recorded ) came live board . For price I guess I n't complain much . Behringer often means trading price longevity QC seems hit miss . So time decide ; I resign replace every year get something mo ? Note : low end , still `` pro audio , '' piece equipment . And truley n't get super loud , people say barely anything volume wise I wonder using home audio equipment ? If , signal strength going unit likely well `` line level '' signal pro gear offers . boosting signal much lower begin . And result getting poor volume plus added `` bonus '' increased distorion and/or floor noise try crank up.Update : well works days others seems- I keep around I good days bad days lately . Ca n't really see rhyme reason it- connections n't seem loose anything like that- I either good volume craps ? ? ? It one permanent location , used way every time- 's never matter different configuration using different gear . This box small , packs great punch ! I n't notice difference audio loss sound . The two dials MIC levels nice stiff , feel like personal monitor station much smaller I thought would , definitely bad thing ! The connectors feel nice whole thing screams quality ( especially $ 20 ) .If find n't getting enough mic headphones , grab ASAP . I bought headphone amp isolation booth recording studio . The idea give vocalist/instrumentalist personal control levels , without engineer change settings manually . The item works GREAT , long 're using powered microphone . If using powered microphone get crazy loud buzzing , interference monitor , microphones plugged . Plus , loud ca n't hear anything microphone . The way I 've gotten rid buzz running unbalanced mic cable headphone amp Direct Box , board . I 'm told Hum eliminator would trick , 's another $ 40- $ 100 I really n't planning forking . I 'd rather engineer change levels vocalist/instrumentalist pay extra $ 100 moment . Again , 's good , n't power microphone . Love amp . My Drummer stoked able use product really enhance music . Affordable great quality This gadget stereo monitor mix & mic get overall mix set add mic get `` '' setting . It 's simple & easy use . Works great . This awesome way get ear monitor game without dropping hundreds dollars . volume main mix , adjust level relative mix without affecting main sound band mates feeds . Perfect singer musician constantly asking & # 34 ; & # 34 ; monitor . You also use control floor monitor want . 
254	I bought friend always wanted play violin never could afford one , quality surprisingly good considering cheap , I helped set ( took 15 minutes max , needed get bridge right ) flaw I found horrible pegs came , I spare rosewood ones drawer fixed small problem , rest violin furniture workmanlike , concert quality serviceable student , body really surprised , mass produced student model nice sound , I believe nicer furniture , better bridge , strings I would ashamed play venue , hold time open question I see internals well put together.this brings real problem , never played instrument makes violin squeal like pig , I good teaching I got books downloaded vids youtube watch still ... Her husband bring violin home till play comes practice , led neighbors believe I responsible sudden several neighborhood cats ( I think noise chased em away ) I waiting call I type . The two violins ordered came time , packaged well . All pieces advertised included . The items appear pictured . It hard rate purchase , I still trying get tune . I using snark clip tuner , yet get strings tune . We purchased peg drops help tuning , still unsuccessful bringing tune . It 's working violin . My daughter likes . Her violin teacher suggests grade strings new Magic . The shoulder rest way high daughter , I n't count defect : - ) mean want something learn violin pretty good , stays tune reinforced weak spots cracks form I bought see I might enjoy learning shoulders ( I 'm ' old ... lol ) would allow hold correct position long enough practice . I would n't say 's instrument WAY I expected $ 60 . After I changed strings , ( I used extra set came ) actually produced decent sound . I bought bow ( & # 62 ; $ 100 , ... ) found I like one came least much.The case excellent ... I 'll prob use upgrade.So price , really get far pay shoulder rest kinda useless though . This violin AMAZING considering 's price , I got girlfriend , expecting maybe complete joke absolutely worthless n't went violin school people payed waay violin sucked . I satisfied costumer , beginner want cheap violin practice till destroy , one 's you.Basic sturdy , gets job done : ) Sounds decent stays tune . For price need want dabble violin . 
255	I many expensive cases guitars recently started playing bass , serious wanted nice little case . Boy surprised , case awesome , great quality , fits bass without problems storage inside great . Definetly reccomend case Bought bass case strat , wanted extra space.as lining q memory foam holds instrument gently place also acts lid open space.I keep several . Books head stock.other reveiwer complained excess space 's I wanted . It chemical smell I open items garage , near trash minutes . Totally happy service product . This second case . Build good carry balance . Brass color lock comes . This nearly identical theGuardian Bass Guitar half cost . However , issues case well issues : covering appears stitched , - part - glued , case left hot , unventilated space like car prolonged periods covering start life edges . On hand , someone takes care gear probably going leave instrument hot car ( garage storage space ) prolonged periods . However , aware issue , reason remind case suffers , imagine effect bass.The limitations simple : case , hard shell design , strong one made ABS plastic . The top relatively flimsy sides . This show stopper use case home storage occasional gigs , heavy road schedule , especially personally loading unloading band 's gear , case afford protection ATA-style note I used case Fender Jazz Bass , long-scale basses fit . I sure brands mentioned ATA-style case better solution , essential protecting instrument heavy road even local gig schedules . For less demanding protection I recommend also consider case ( I purchased upgrade I became aware issues limitations Musician 's Gear model : SKB Electric Bass Hardshell , standard latches , still opt Musician 's Gear case , still getting relatively good value certainly making large step soft gig bag . When I looking Bass Case I wanted something expensive would protect bass . This fits bill perfectly . It 's really case meant heavy travel ( like checking airport ) definitely take good care bass normal travel . And internal compartment really nice storing straps , cables , strings , etc . For price excellent case . These means touring cases . They 're inexpensively made , good thing I hate pay case cost half guitar cost I n't tour . That said , great job protecting guitars n't stand . I 've got dozen guitars 're gon na played anytime soon I want put away something substantial gig bag . These nicely purpose . They certainly capable taking instrument gig , I would n't put pricey guitar case I new baggage shipping going handling . So , I recommend , aware limitations . 
256	I love picks .88mm seems perfect balance stiffness suppleness playing . I LONG time user big Fender triangular picks . I play rhythm guitar bluegrass Columbus , . I play mainly Martin HD-28 , also Blueridge BR-180 Seagull S6 Coastal Spruce . I bought set try I nothing negative say picks , I still prefer big Finder 's . I guess I 'm used big pick . While I playing one Tortex picks , I found index finger hitting strings , n't tainted big Fender picks , try set . I guess I could get used , stick big Fenders . These favorite picks play . The Dunlop Tortex Picks nice warm sound acoustic . These excellent guitar picks . They n't slip fingers like Eddie Van Halen guitar picks I purchased back . Tortex picks best . Pitch black cool . 1.0 mm perfect thickness . Do n't buy picks , buy Tortex ... Black ... . 1.0 mm perfect combination . If used Tortex picks , I highly recommend giving try . They NOT flimsy plastic cracks splits like tortoise shell picks see . These much flexible last forever . The reason I 've ever needed get new one package I lost one I using ... Just aware really light players . They sell many different thickenesses colors , give order different ones see like . My favorite ... perfect balance flex strength . 
257	They work good . Way stiff small though . Great attack holding onto problem . The slick finish makes kinda hard hold onto small amount pick shows makes strumming difficult without hitting finger strings . I imagine would work great lead players I 'm rhythm player . Nice tone , easy grip , last long time . One favorite picks I 've tried electric . Do n't enjoy much acoustic . They half size regular pick . Bit thick . Sound nice . Will last forever . Wish I sized I bought . I love little guys . The small size forces hold tips exposed . They nice textured grip . I bought red ones time I see I drop ! I used use Fender medium picks . Now Jazz metal I use pick . You try see right . I like Dunlop products I used purple tortex 1.14mm almost exclusively I met Jazz III . And personal debate continues ... I like thick pick Jazz III . I like tortex n't ... I really like orange color makes easy locate drop . I rarely I mean rarely drop tortex pick nylon might get bit slick times.They make 3 4 picks line varying degrees tip pointiness . I like pointy model others round rounder tips.This new improved jazz style pick I still trying figure I like trad Fender jazz pick . Or perhaps slightly different picks laying around n't bad idea . I always thin medium 351 style pick person , fellow musician one stage I quite surprised well worked . I used guitar also bass really works well good solid grip . Been using longer decade , met many people prefer minimal picks , jazz III among . This closest playing bare hand I get . I bought colors reviews well . I like thickness pick . Easy hang onto strumming . Love tone I obtain . title says . may take getting use smaller picks long run e happy tried picks . also since picks smaller , found easy pinch harmonics compared bigger picks , hard time pinch harmonics try . I bought used week giving review.If Amazon used half-stars , I would given . I could n't bring give 4/5 I went 3/5 , 's : I 've used standard medium picks 20 years . Switching problem . Sure , smaller small enough cause problems . By far biggest change & # 34 ; pointy-ness & # 34 ; picks . The distinct point pick drastically changes sound playing , especially playing chords . Everything much pronounced , n't necessarily good thing opinion . It 's especially bad playing clean electric ( picking notes strumming ) .If someone ask good picks , answer would & # 34 ; & # 34 ; It really , opinion , depends 're playing . From rhythm standpoint , I n't like - take warmth chords point pick makes strummed chords sound sterile . For lead work OK really dig note come through.Could I play faster ? No . Could I pull amazing licks I could n't normal picks ? tried , n't like . Maybe typically play TON lead work , constantly , would way go . I n't , n't . I 'm glad I tried , though , I 'll never wonder . I 've used two years recently shifted big brother , jazz 3 XL . Same thickness feel , larger form factor . I would definitely recommend XL version rhythm+lead work required . For strictly solo work easy achieve pinch harmonics , one better . 
258	I bought restore neck Ibanez I ordered used knew needed coats stuff neck like factory ! It restored years neglect I bought I though would n't enough . BOY WAS I WRONG . I 'll enough oil last awhile makes happy I get new guitar feel neck months years come . got treat fretboard guitar . Nice bottle w/ safety cap prevent unintentional opening . dried fretboard condition . I needed fretboard cleaner . This something I tried . I used I like . Has nice smell , works like charm . This bottle probably last 10 years . Good cheap price ... recommended purchase . This nice smell , good maintaining wood neck guitar . Best used replacing strings , apply strings . Clean really good prints smell nice . My first time using like alot since works good . Nice quality fretboard oil . Has nice scent , remember little goes long way . I would definitely recommend . Worked nice maple unfinished fretboard . I maintain guitars regular basis since I longer guitar tech everything ! Take care fretboards fingers fretboards happy ! 
259	Cleans strings makes fingers go across strings little good long lasting product little goes long way.It VERY safe guitar finishes . That cloth ... They included something n't fall 's great . I use recommended container keeps strings nice conditioned , I 'm people commented ca n't really tell much stuff left inside . Good idea keep one around . I play 5-string bass , electric acoustic love stuff . Each bass I different strings various reasons I use every one . My wife uses 6-string acoustic electric guitars . We keep every case ! No spill , mess . This one easiest use products cleaning strings necks . Just use fast fret wipe rag . It dry , lasts years . The thing I n't like fit accessory area guitar case led sharp edges , put using cleaner . Fast Fret , least kind string cleaner ' anyone plays guitar . Because , think , strings get really dirty time , product solves issue . : ) This stuff lube strings pretty well ! The downside leaves tiny pieces fuzz strings times use- comes little cloth I assume meant little inconvenience . There 's much say product , except works . It makes strings last longer . Sometimes I get lazy owning many guitars , 20 minutes per & # 34 ; well done & # 34 ; restring adds . This great way put keep jamming long possible . It 's small conveniently stored . I recommend trying ! I used Fast Fret number years think 's great product . It comes metal cap applicator versus old plastic cap applicator . This much better way package product probably help retain lubricant longer . I really love . Tends time still good product . Recommended . I others state must-have . I fret noise recordings fingers dragging fingerboard . This really lowers friction makes much playable instrument supposedly protects wood . I 've used back neck well helps much fingerboard . I rub entire neck I play . It makes guitar smell like came right shop , I suspect must 've using years never told , though I never ask ... foolish . Since I 've recently gotten setups , I 've read many forums posters recommended I figured heck , 's less $ 5 . I discovered string lubricant many years ago I concur reviewers said although I would n't call string cleaner although indirectly clean strings use cloth like another reviewer stated also use cloth clean undersides strings well . I unfortunately live humid climate little strings short life anything prolong life real boon musician . I agree downside inability tell advance running low lubricant actually turns dry I guess given price overall usefulness accessory , one complain much . Now mine run dry I 'm going delay replacement purchase I try something new I 've discovered called `` The '' enables clean undersides topsides strings without chemicals . If works well advertised , I may still get Fast-Fret lubricating properties really helps make playing lot ! The name says . FAST fret = FAST fingers ! I played 40 live shows 45 min sets 2.5 hr sets year national stages . My strings take lot abuse slow sweat , grime , dirt flying air . This stuff honestly works well . It part regular arsenal . Especially price , great buy . The strings acoustic starting get bit loud I would slide fretboard , I noticing quite bit lag sliding . The downside would much easier apply directly frets without strings , appeal bring life back strings n't shining like use . I take little extra time care get much oil onto fretboard make sure I wiped thoroughly possible , required folding provided rag inserting strings fretboard taking time I went fret fret . Not big deal though result pleasing . The ease sliding tremendously improved strings sound feel better ever ! Take 10-15 minutes guitar favor ... I got yesterday I n't know long prolong string 's life I noticed difference already . It 's lot easier play since strings feel lot smoother makes worth buying alone . Also , 's cheap I would give shot I . I 'm really happy I `` discovered '' product , fact , I 'm already ordering 2 . This fifth time buying stuff ! I really like new container . The tin way nicer old plastic one . This stuff works great lasts forever ! I play daily one stick last least year gets use . One swipe plenty ( 2 strings time nut bridge ) ; fold cloth wipe clean . Makes moving power chords soloing much easier . I using GHS Fast fret six years 's amazing stuff , I apply tiny amount strings I play wipe afterwards , I used change strings every one two months strings last year . It 's easy control home much put one stuff lasts year two , n't really reason soak everything I n't think , I mainly use clean strings . I 'm really glad I found stuff ! Very nice product . Strings feel sound noticeably better plus white mineral oil smells really good applied neck . I used bass guitar older strings made strings brighter lively . I try guitars prolong life strings . I like packaging small cloth comes . I use sections shirts clean strings put inside packaging along cloth . This must fingerpicking guitar bass player . This product great , I use every session . Keeps strings clean conditions fret board . Every guitar player keep case . Not expert cheap simple cleans protects strings . Hope helps thank This makes sliding bass real smooth . It 's also nice cleaning . It hard tell running low oil whatever liquid thing seem last fairly long time . And 's super easy apply . Even though 're pro , act like one slap stuff bass guitar play . This product seems . It cool name , 's . It 's tool oil stinks . I tried best get use product , learned much better ways going studio recording 1st time . After away Fast-Fret , playing improved I hardly ever change string . Not mention getting crap fingers nasty . I use Old English guitars thank , nose thanks fingers thank . You ... Seems work well , though I n't know long 's supposed last . I sweaty hands , I 'm done I wipe guitar lil guy helps lot keep strings getting dirty cruddy . I agree reviews , found another area use fast fret : THE . When tuning , strings ( especially lower wound strings ) hang nut causes string pop instead slide would roller nut . Fast Fret onto nut tuning , problem greatly reduced . I got product clean condition guitar fretboards ( well duh ! ) Does work ? Yes . First appear anything coming . After bit rubbing I notice & # 34 ; slight & # 34 ; bit solution ( turns mineral oil ) fretboard frets . I tried spread included cloth discovered cloth useless ( paper towel would hold better- seriously ! ) I used old tee shirt square spread oil honestly took 10 15 mins I noticed NO difference appearence playability guitar . It says use session- thats 30 mins time per guitar ( I general play 2 guitars course session ) . I still use occasionally , I would spend money purchase . Just I looking fret board cleaner . Let 's cut chase : , less , tight roll soaked mineral oil . But 's exactly I need clean protect fretboard . The lubricating feature nice plus . I used 5string bass . I liked helps slide around fretboard easier . My friend tried acoustic guitar hated reason opinion simple . This stuff puts LOT oil ( whatever ) would think . This unintended consequence oil making callouses soft ... playing guitar lead fingers pretty fast ( friend ) .To apply simply hold handle press running along string , one string time . I highly suggest use one slide string . At first may look like anything getting strings , give minutes start see excess oil appear start pooling strings fretboard . That 's ok. You need wipe away excess , I 'm telling , accidentally get much , excess oil may come easily ( n't least ) . Mine left little pools oil frets , I used one swipe thought I little . Naturally , product also makes fingers oily feeling . My friend hated part , I agree . Soft callouses = callouses . This good product idea , I like theory , thick bass strings I n't severe problem w soft fingertips . Just aware possibility problem you.It says , may like else feels fingers . I 've already posted Fast Fret . I love stuff . It 's mandatory inclusion every one guitar cases . The tips fingers often get pretty dry cracked , especially I 've playing lot . The problem , least , pieces dead skins sometimes catch guitar strings making slides , bends , pull-offs less fluid . A strokes GHS makes fretboard give much smoother playing experience . An alternative would using fingers , would probably terrible fretboard . Also , I sometimes use board smooth fingertips helps , I 'd rather little possible keep callouses strong . GHS allows minimize . 
260	This Behringer box good tool , effect I would recommend anyone beginner pro . One thing noted light amber blue 9 volt battery required . The device comes removable power cord , big plus . This pedal `` ok '' I mean , I provides basic functions says . Quality-wise , feels bit ... .I afraid I going snap pot something playing . The case metal feels like thinnest sheet metal could get away building . The power switch chorus/vibrato switch clearly cheapest switches could find , easily accessible toe ... got ta bend flip . They small.On hand sixty-nine-bucks - relatively inexpensive multifunction effect pedal.I n't care rear facing upwardly angled input , output power jacks . That 's pedal board friendly opinion . Nice tabletop effect . The footprint fairly huge board '' x 6.5 '' ( approx ) . The `` standard '' 9V center negative power supply `` postive '' ( excuse pun . ) If looking way play signal modulation - echos , vibratos , reverbs , old style choruses ... bad way get started playing . You make lot sounds without breaking , I effects make sounds smaller space , ... keeper . Your situation might different bad product , acceptable 's price point , n't impress much . When purchase product advertisement leads believe separate power supply required come power supply . There need purchase separate Behringer time machine works fine , described . I really like delay . It 's simple works well . I really starting love Behringer . Great pedal great price . This awesome analog echo effect . Very similar EHX Memory Man . The complaint pots limited function unlike MM instead lot play knobs little bit play annoying . Other price awesome .

I two Hercules stands electric guitars , I could n't happier . When I needed acoustic stand I turned Hercules regrets . At forefront purchasing decision safety guitars . Not stands hold guitars securely , n't harm finishes instrument . Unfortunately many stands harm nitrocellulose lacquer many higher-end guitars ; since I two guitars nature , protecting utmost import . Fortunately stands protect nitrocellulose finishes , I never problems mine . The stands ( varieties ) fold compact need portability , support guitar securely . I n't gig guitars , portability , stability : stands extremely stable sturdy ( mine reside carpeted floor , I never issues tipping . ) Some people may love yellow black `` '' coloration , I actually find whimsically industrial . I completely happy three Hercules stands : safe , portable , rugged , wo n't hurt finish guitars . If I need another guitar stand , 's good bet I buy another Hercules . This nice , sturdy well made guitar stand . It great gigs small travels lightly . This thing relatively heavy small stand . Of course one might think would translate sturdy , one would correct . Super simple use . No buttons , levers , knobs . Just pop open . It n't actual mechanical locking feature , design fully open outside legs basically lock place . It holds acoustic securely , I fear 's going tip . When 're done , nudge outer legs `` unlock '' 's super easy fold back up.I Fender mini acoustic stand , n't fold flat enough fit nicely gig bag I figured I would try one . I quite happy fact fold flatter . HOWEVER ... .. I give four stars folded three back feet stack give 2.75 '' thickness . If Hercules could figured way avoid , baby would truly fold flat magazine . It 's still pretty flat takes less room bag , I think guys used little creative license description . ( Either 're comparing year end recap issue . ) Still great little stand I would buy needed . 
267	Do like shift around seat ? You ca n't ! It 's narrow 17 inches . I going wider one . ( seems decent ) Updated March 4th , 2014 : I ordered On Stage KT7800 several weeks . I much happier , easier adjust . The first one I ordered defective I send back , butt I good go . I ordered bench last Christmas ( 2005 ) . I 'm satisfied far . Good value seat generously padded 2.5 inches thick . Padding material soft , good frame construction feels sturdy.Contrary one reviews , bench came height adjustment ( on-the-fly kind thing , though ) . Each legs 3 holes ( low , middle , high ) . A fixing bolt goes one holes legs , bolt becomes crossing point `` X '' . Three positions roughly correspond 18 , 19 20 changing height , loosen remove fixing bolt , insert whichever hole like tighten . Do n't worry , n't need tool job , thanks large plastic knob . See picture 'll understand works.Mine initially came middle position . I also tried high low , set back middle . It seems good compromise family , bench used daily , wife kids . Sure 's nicer change height quickly easily . However , price , I would n't complain . This perfect digital piano . We love . Easy assembly . I would recommend anyone . This bench well constructed comfortable sit extended periods . My complaint I wish little height maybe 1 inch . Overall , well suited unless tall small child . Pretty straight forward bench . I surprised comfy price . Good height , comfortable , Id buy , questions asked . First , I would extremely wary durability piano bench $ 50 . Second , professional piano player I never found use traveling `` bench '' `` stool . '' Think : 've got heavy keyboard haul plus amp plus keyboard stand maybe music stand , electric light music , perhaps even storage case cables , adapters , extra fuses , batteries , tuners , sometimes extra keyboard two , couple tone generators MIDI cables , , still pack , spare tines pair wire cutters -- 're going add bench ( ! ) weekly moving equipment ? In 90 % locations I 've worked , I 'm able locate plain chair without arms ( usually kitchen crew knows house spartan chair found ) . Not reduce one , helps protect body structure problems piano players , especially , prone course thousands hours slouching , subjecting finger joints unhealthy amounts pressure , caught chords scales retrieving melodies register effects job . I 've always act players stand playing -- far better entire configuration human ( mention prostate ) . In fact , club restaurant regular piano bench one padded , rising lowering black Steinway cushions , try replace plain chair without arms . Especially 're 4-hour gigs , sometimes two day , 'll notice difference short long term.Bottom line , back needs bottom , need seat back . Only concert artists like could get away Steinway stools -- 30 minutes complete done ( actually stress gone upon first movement ) . Some us n't lucky -- -- smart . 
268	I bought gig bag carry Fender strat around . I 'm starting learn guitar I n't really know much options . I figured I Fender guitar I might well get Fender gig I realize good one really . Most gig bags n't come storage pockets . There 's plenty room books , electronic tuner , string winder , strings , whatever.Padding could always , 's case probably soft-shell bag , I like bag since I 've discovered options price range n't nearly good . I really like deluxe bags fender . Plenty space stuff , good straps carry options enough padding provide much protection soft bag . The previous reviewer obviously got defective case . The case I got works incredibly well , always keeps guitar well protected , back comfortable carrying . It lot space , looks pretty good . I 'd recommend anyone ! I 've 3 good years bag , still yet rip . I bought bag mostly practice sessions , across town . It 's decent build quality , I would n't feel comfortable gig duty . It 's got fair amount padding , nice storage array , , I personally feel bag suited 12 mile trip practice lessons . I got love . My Fender Stratocaster fits perfectly bag , padded well .

If need bag protect fender carry stuff , buy one . I LOVE IT . I would expect pay hundred bucks kind quality spent 30 bucks . This excellent gig bag . Plenty compartments accessories . Well padded enough carrying options . A good buy .

270	We bought Pyle-Pro Wireless Microphone System use thePyle . We needed extra wireless mic workshop presenters inexpensive choice . For price , worked lot better I expected take adjustment `` Trim Screw '' receiver get clarity range needed . We also tape little wire antenna n't hanging front speaker ( might issue , depending plug ) .There lot expensive wireless mic units I 'm sure would provide better sound range , one works fine uses.Overall , good value low cost unit . Barring interference devices radio stations broadcasting frequency manufacturer 's defects ... unit meant . I however question whether word `` Pro '' apply system . Although 1/4 inch mono plug comes receiver offers ability plugging directly powered speaker systems mixer , overall quality audio brought back memories standing outside classroom schoolmates listening first national anthem played announcements coming pa system . The signal experience fading transmitter moved . To , fighting radio music station broadcasting near band frequency received transmitter 25 feet away.After playing device couple minutes , I noticed movement whether I kept receiver transmitter stationary I moved home moved transmitter severely affected quality reception . Even length mic cord , whether wound straight even gathered around sending unit effect sound output quality . ! ! ! Perhaps competing signal receiving another source I previously described . I 'm afraid would usable dependable device purposes . I 'll probably returning unit asap . If better mic , plug transmitter 's simple mini jack ( 1/8 & # 34 ; ) helps sound wise quite bit ! I say range great , wo n't go 500 feet like expensive Sennheiser kit go 30 feet line sight cutting 's , prone find transmitters ' cheap battery cover fit well . I also wish XLR connection . A lock plug transmitter would also nice note clip plastic n't toss around WILL general use doors , 's decent sure worth price ... 're looking something clear , look spend least $ 500 wireless lapel handheld system . Bought back-up AT system tried living room . Home tests show works fairly well environment although I think I hear little distortion I turn gain much ( I n't think change gain AT system ) . My nitpick I 'll need use adapter go guitar plug 1/8 & # 34 ; . For price , 's amazing . I hope works field well . I bought -- hey , wireless mic $ 13 ? Why ? I able use public address system -- connections work , makes sounds , static unbearable matter much I fiddle different , adjustment screw receiver ... nothing works . The audio always clipped . Do n't even think using music . Arrive , trashed packing , worst sounded like piece chalk ... certainly NOT professional quality quality I would give . My wife & Celtic duo number shows renaiessance visable pa equipment allowed . We considered wireless use battery powered Crate could easily hidden wireless receivers need power outlet & events power available . When I saw price offered mic transmitter receiver battery powered I thought worth try . In past problem keeping events natural acoustics less stellar plain could n't hear stories songs . We use give voices small , unobvious boost . It kind effect adding tweeter speaker gives voices understood . The result stay entire show , laughing , crying tragedy . Our tips & cd sales gone WAY . Is high fidelity ? Quite simply , . But case works beautifully . Recommended , remember price point wo n't disappointed .

272	Dont last couple weeks..terrible feed back ends near plugs quickly . Will never buy even 5 bucks What I say ? It 's cable . It 's cheap , works advertised . Much less expensive try force local music shops . Gold tips , yeah , right ! Nice one , small , soft , cheap cable comfortable lenght . Nothing else I say : ) Take cheap guitars . I 've used several different kinds guitar cables , I 've finally settled planet waves cables . From patch cables guitar cables , I simply trust company . In cases difference guitar cables difference iPhone Android , really n't one - simply comes user prefrence . So regard , I prefer planet waves cables . I snagged cable I one right angle pedal board end guitar . Highly recommended ! It want cable , n't . Not insanely priced pixie gold dust sprinkled , quiet supple uses good quality plugs ends . So ; nothing magical , guitar cable . cables nicely constructed . bought home use . home recording practicing.they seem work well far . wouldnt gig regular basis , home use , , last . The Planet Waves Classic Series 10ft Instrument Cable basic , works great flexible . Seems sturdy enough last long time . I many Planet Waves cables . They work well , well constructed good value . I would highly recommend Plant Waves Cables . I 've purchased many cables I 'll getting eventually . Cables , even good ones , eventually break . These quite flexible , seem durable , brand name . If need cables , work great . First I liked fact came coiled circular coil instead bow tie pattern leaves bends lenght cord . The jacks sealed rubber provide stress relief . It sounds ok price . I purchased Planet Waves 10 Ft Instrument cable son hook electric guitar amplifier . It works well ... connectivity issues whatsoever . Highly recommend . It 's bit thinner average thick I would like works well kind nice slick put away . Very smooth . I think pricey monster cables half price . I buy Planet Waves . Absolutely complaints cables . We use power two Fender Squier Strats , happy sound quality use . The plugs sturdy injection molded provide good strain relief . For price 's worry solder quality , since repair would cost time new cable.We also use expensive metal cover Hosa Cables see appreciable difference sound quality.Great short connections mixers straight - 10 ' , 1/4 '' mono ( tip ) I bought spares also use amps swap back like right angle plug end guitar input fits std . Telecaster input jack great.The flexibility cable another thing liked . These tangle use easily storage . I expensive cables rather use . I really like cord , rolls easy , long , got great powdery feel material . I suggest multiple length wont problem , got 6 , sound great , ( Right angle Straight ) .Great buy , cant go wrong . This cable dirt cheap , quality seems fine . I using primary rig setup I ca n't tell different cables . Recommended . These cables I hoped would . They work well electric acoustic . Happy guy Thanks I 've come point anytime I buy new guitar cable planet waves . They good quality , decently priced , I n't worry shorting . buy . No problems product . Works well five string bass amp purchased Amazon . I would recommend product . I prefer cable lot expensive cables 's inexpensive , yet lightweight , flexible , acceptable quality . The problem lot expensive cables greater weight stiffness , feels nice first feels `` studio , '' 're actually using cable , tendency heavy get way things . For instance , Monster instrument cables tendency move tuner around heavy bucks , I prefer Pro Co , since metal ends ( lifetime warranty simpler , call Sweetwater ) , feels nicer , I like fine . Second one I bought . Lousy build quality lasted 3 months . Went two I learned lesson . Do n't waste money junk . I love Planet Waves stuff normally , junk . I like Planet Waves instrument cables . The cable material bendable easy work . Great far . WOW , need guitar cable ... 's metal tips long black body ( like long snake shiny ends ) , works fine long enough playing ... guitar amp need ... even without guitar amp 's still fun ! ! ! & # 60 ; & # 60 ; & # 60 ; warned review may help ... go next , need & # 62 ; & # 62 ; & # 62 ; I plugged amp , I plugged bass , issues wire . This one products n't want overly notice , done job designed . I got couple ... .only buy cable NO ever used real world ... month mine developed nasty short plug ... .and course , since cord tight , ca n't repaired ... ... .you could cut plug solder good 1/4 inch plug ... bother . ? ... .just save headaches money buy good heavy duty cord ... .this cord flimsy ... ... junk fancy molded plastic ergonomic looking plug housing ... inside junk ... away ! ! ! ... ... .buy scratch instead , , , Simply , great cables . They snap right , carry sound well , come lifetime warranty . The 15 ' length right , one dollar per foot good value . Recommended . I n't used cable yet , looks new durable . The cable appears structurally sound around end connections seems I expected . Ca n't wait rest gear get I sound test . Based physical condition , I would recommend product . A simple affordable instrument cable . I prefer cable ends formed ( type unscrewed ) , less risk breakage noise . Cable quality high ( professional recorded 'll something better ) , good general . cable conducive good tone jacks wear one year use . Still highly recommended money , Great sound quality , meets full expectations . Cable flexible also seems strong good physical quality . It 's worth spending extra dollars good quality cable rather buy crappy cables . This bought based advice others . I cable standard ends fail , cable supposed either strain free simply designed long life strain usage.It worked great 4-6 months , broke . It happened quickly ( trad types seem take longer ) I swore must output jack guitar . After guitar okay , I tried shorter cable , worked offer lifetime replacement , puts bit bind - need backup cable waiting replacement , pay return shipping defective cable . You also get altogether , makes deal breaker . The extra costs essentially make cable expensive something track record lasting years . In case , I bit bullet I done first got really nice DiMarzio , cable SOUNDS good works - capacitance longer cables issue . The good news IMO high price guarantee ANY cable sounding good . The replacement DiMarzio another example one top list cable comparisons . I n't get mojo aspects typically find someone paying much cable , I want durability published capacitance within certain range . This one meets half criteria , gets expensive potential fail sooner rather later . Well , expensive relative cable initially higher price longer replacement Planet Waves sent backup , still original packaging . I figure I 'll use short periods replacing main cable , last long time situation . If I $ shipping D'Addario still honoring lifetime warranty if/when 2nd one breaks , I may get replaced . More likely I chalk learning lesson toss . Even $ 4 shipping decent percentage cost durable cable - IMO set aside eventual replacement.If cable would last 1.5 2 years , I 'd probably give 5 stars given price . And D'Addario took away warranty thing , would probably re-shape customer 's perception something price cost , 's wear item , plain simple . IDK much R & D ; 's worth trouble put something price point , 's I would shoot - realistically acceptable period trouble-free use w/no warranty trade-off . That would NOT make deal breaker . Best inexpensive right angle cables . I use lesson room music store I teach . They last forever take care . I wanted something inexpensive well made decided go Planet Waves similarly priced Fender cable . I like tip one piece instead screw price right . When I replace cable I likely buy cable something else PW cables I owned PW seems withstand abuse effectively . This cable really good price ! using creepy cables makes noises plugged amp one keeps quiet . Would like purchase another one future . Buy ! 's worth I 've used many guitar cables years I lost count . It 's hard find tough , low noise cable less ten bucks anywhere , one best one price paid . Its made well , strong plug ends thick yet flexable cable covering I love . I use equipment connections , simply works problems noise I could detect . Try , 'll discover band mate 's , best cable money Amazon ! Not greatest cord I ever used , worst either . I would prefer Fender Tweed cables one I make recommendation . Once I switched cables I never use anything else . Great connection sounds good issues . I ordered spare use lower end keyboard ( Casio PX-320 ) I could leave expensive Roland RD-300NX home studio . Much surprise cable pro quality . It 's noise free Rock 21 ' Instrument Cable , I tell difference two cables I using one either keyboards . The remainder review going compare cable Monster model.I 'll give Monster cable plus outer jacket overall construction , matters - signal transmission - I frankly tell two apart . Part reason may cable uses foil braided shielding minimize handling noise . And I sure copper conductor also something . Both every expensive Monster cable one share high end components love strain relief cable one Monster . It better job holding flex minimum , although connectors Monster better quality.Bottom line : Monster cable wins places , one slouch cheaply made piece junk . In fact , I probably keep Monster cables home studio switch completely model gigging . For one thing , discernible degradation sound quality one , another costs fifth I paid Monster . Even insist using expensive cables , great one spare . I several cables various lengths pleased quality performance . I use particular length cable patching various pieces audio gear rehearsal space plugging direct box stage.The ends solid connected cable material 'slinky ' , i.e . stiff difficult work like cables tend lifetime warranty cables great addition price . Its solid . Has great quality . & n't short . I months & tear anywhere site Planet Waves printed cord `` guaranteed life '' think mean XD Good cable works , using rhythmtrak foot switch . Just right length . May order extra 's . Solid , reliable rocks.Works expected last really really long time . Glad I bought . Nothing else say . Thanks . Very good sound quality . I professional guitarist , cables fine . Clear amazing cable VERY incredibly cheap amazing sound quality overall I n't measured signal throughput I ca n't comment . But cable impress easy handle . This thing simply crimp , , get twisted tension . It 's easiest handling cable I 've ever dealt , real pleasure 've got kinds wires running . It 's like floppy noodle light sturdy , jacks strong stable loose one right-angle connection , right angle perfect fit jack bottom end Telecaster . The Planet Waves Classic Series Instrument Cable , 5 feet well pro made cable always exactly I needed . What one say cable ? They intended transmit electrical impulse least amount interference one superb job that.Why I thinking replacing cables additional cables like one , slightly longer good deal shorter depending intended function . I love fit sound quality . It n't come loose wiggle place . I 'll get one ! A good cable money . Could better stress release , certainly plenty good enough normal use good value . I honestly amazed flexible cord . I really like right angle plug amp , n't make wire ' like straight plug would . Good stuff . Well cable certainly n't last long title says 8 weeks . Bought new Fender v2 amp week half ago . Last night amp would turn n't putting sound guitar . around bit started work . thing 's obvious nothing going guitar amp . Thought I bad jack new amp n't happy . Got old amp guess nothing either . At least new amp working I replace $ 12 I 'm unlucky got bad one I bought local store I 'd return . Not going hassles mailing back asking refund . Will move another company 's cord . The cable died less month . Very disappointed built quality . It I need get bass guitar amp . much use five feet length gig show since I rocking house 's big deal . This chord almost 30 bucks regular store different name , sounds great wo n't trip place rocking , get one today . havent used one yet . got run pedal board stages backline easily accessible . seems like well made cable like planet waves products general Always high quality reasonable price . More durable cheap cables find online less expensive 'boutique ' cables.. Great working-man 's gear . Not cheap ca n't rely , expensive ca n't buy number extras . It came nice looks great - feels high quality.So far still works well.10 ft nice 're performer ... longer required . 
273	Hey , 's fun little toy , I 've seen thing going places even $ 100 ridiculous . I lucky enough get Amazon $ 80 . Once get novelty sit top amp collect dust . I 've made cool effects written many great riff 's one tools 'll use every song ... unless 're amazing make work every song ! Learning use properly finding nuances making work half fun , get , 're , wonder wasted $ 100 something n't cost $ 50 . It 's essentially 9V battery covered plastic pretty blue light . This one impulse buys grabbed hold I nothing better use money . I first became aware EBow way back 80 's song & # 34 ; Big Country & # 34 ; band Big Country came . They used simulate bagpipes I always loved sound . I finally purchased EBow year ago . I 'm songwriter record demos home . I also perform live cover band . I n't use EBow often I , really adds performance . I recorded EBow track original song passage acoustic guitar added another dimension overall sound made recording sound professional . For live playing little tricky sometimes takes seconds get strings start vibrating . With practice , I think could improve . I play solo 's & # 34 ; Girl & # 34 ; sounds much like original recording . People audience tend take notice solo I get questions works . I good luck , practice could improve this.The octave switch great controlled feedback sound . Battery life exceptional . I replace battery . Overall , I think great product . I wish bit less expensive I lost , I 'd buy another one . The ebow crazy concept . It 's fun use also challenging . It comes book many variations use , nice . Comes velvet pouch . It 's little pricey I assume supply demand 've got extra cash play every day , pick . Also , I played band guitar player played trumpet part ebow . I n't know setting amp , sound like room . He clearly , good ebow . Goes show diverse . If 've seen youtube videos , know do.I especially appreciate two modes : one regular sustain one ' sustain.They switched back forth even 're sustaining ca n't wait use band - 'll cover `` With Without You '' sure ! [ ... ] I wanted dismiss try . I wanted like , unfortunately , n't thing . I played 2 weeks I got bored stopped . It sits amp collecting dust . I pick occasionally , I always end putting back shortly . I sorry , I ca n't dig ... : ( Edit : So apparently , lot people dislike review comments section post . Normally , I 'd laugh , I sick getting constant internet tough guys , I 'd like formally state bad product . It fun , effects gives worth $ 100 , build quality worth $ 100 . Like I said original post , I became bored item roughly two weeks purchase changed . The last time I picked battery blackout active pickups schecter . Its I `` n't know use '' like one morons comments section stated , product requires little skill use . Read manual trouble , explains great detail techniques utilize I recommend ? If hundred bucks drop , go . If , money best spent elsewhere . The great tool musician looking get really sound guitar . Great tool ! 
274	I expected good mic 's amazing much different quality standard desk mic . I use microphone mainly record music . Occasionally I use voice chat supposedly excels quality compared desktop USB microphones . I think best way describe microphone & # 34 ; average & # 34 ; outperform higher-end non-USB microphones I played past . While & # 34 ; outstanding & # 34 ; microphone , 's still great entry-level product budget.The microphone relatively easy use ( plug USB cable ) needs accessories efficient . For instance , stand comes microphone hold microphone upright . It seems like tip breathe wrong way . Remember buy solid desk ( floor ) stand microphone , well shock mount pop filter . I musician needed budget home studio equipment . Paired nice pop filter , mic able produce amazing vocal recordings . You 'd surprised find many famous youtube musicians podcast use mic . It took time get hang miking amps , positions vocal distance , I truly getting money 's worth 's putting . Check demos quality youtube need convincing . I glad I made purchase.I 've owned mic 2 years 're curious durability . I looking better quality Mic willing pay high price sing Internet . This low price high quality solution . Nothing load I singing right box.It pick noise around since condenser mic , means pick quiet place record.. LOL This mic absolutely awesome ! It looks feels SO high quality . The sound stunning . It could tiny bit better price , I 'm absolutely pleased overall . Best mic price range far ! This microphone 's quality amazing . I hooked PC ( Windows 7 ) worked hassle whatsoever . Nothing install jump , works great . I recommend buying mic stand kind really want eliminate vibration background noises . The stand comes stable , low ground ( case , ) may pick unwanted background noise ( computer fans , mouse , etc ) . I use record vocals acoustic guitar iMac . The simplicity mic nice . The sound quality also decent . I n't ever used one 'professional ' quality ones disappointed far . The complaint I ' switch . The way turn unplug . Other I totally recommend Microphone ! This best USB Condenser mic I 've ever used . I needed buy condenser mic recently XLR . I bought AT2020 XLR version , simply due fantastic results I 've achieved one.I use microphone podcasting . I record music , I n't tried yet . If 're curious sound quality , listen podcast `` Rock '' iTunes give idea I 'm using : Windows GB ramPentium 4 Dual core 2.2 build quality fantastic , built like tank really . The knock I little tripod stand . Yes , 's tripod stand , I ca n't imagine actually spot I 'd rather use On-Stage desktop mic stand.Anyways , great mic . Ca n't recommend enough . It 's made check Audio-Technica products . works great , small easy place side way , simple setup , plug , change preference settings works I bought microphone youtube/podcasting REALLY perfect job . The quality great . It I expected . I also bought desktop mic stand , well shockmount popfilter . Highly recommended .

276	I always loved Hercules products . Their mic stands guitar stands . They great quality handy , especially one , performances 3 guitars used . holds three guitars . Fits everything bass , acoustic electrics , , harmonicas transport . Pretty adjustable too.I bought buying two single guitar stands Hercules . I also trombone sax/clarinet stand . All A+ reasonable prices . Apparently one never many guitars , stand keep three ready immediate access . Very stable . The heads rock ! pretty compact travel . The optional carry bag must IMHO . A real workhorse sure . Not heavy still robust reliable holding expensive guitars . I also 6 guitar one incredibly big ... almost big still easy use get hang . I 've stand 5 years used stage last 3 years pretty steady . The first thing broke piece keeps upper shaft pulling way base extend - disclaimer cold I immediately extended maximum point always letting hit collar stop . It 's plastic ; Plastic cold n't mix - The retainer piece broke went flying I standing guitar stand two pieces right gig . I managed get back together I careful extending neck . The part I 've problems upper collar mounts top stand holds guitar necks . It come completely I must continually tighten hex screw prevent top falling . I wo n't mark stand less 4 stars even issues really great stand . Another person noted pay attention guitar dimensions , good advice . Long bass guitars end resting bottom leg tripod . This 2nd Hercules Stand . Great stand managing multiple guitars . Does fair well stored non area . The handle gets real sticky causes problems . I friend also experienced problem . So keep stored climate controlled area great stand . Just got stand today ... delivery EVER Super free shipping selected I ever experienced ! Go go , Amazon ! lulz , I two banjos mandolin I purchased . I looked quite bit various sites , reviews , prices , etc , pretty much Hercules got best reviews everywhere ( although admittedly I n't really wanted shell 50 dollars ) . Yet tri-stand really looked good solid general review , I rather tight space overall ( think trailer home size ) . I wanted way hold instruments one place without work around hard cases taking limited space ' . As stands ( figuratively literally ) , Hercules job excellently two banjos . All three instruments varying heights , resonator bluegrass banjo longest , ( naturally ) mandolin shortest , open back clawhammer banjo three 'back-rest ' fold outs static , attached center ring , `` '' adjust independently , compensate length difference bluegrass banjo mandolin . However , mandolin really lite thing , I suspect fine hanging peg head without 'back-rest ' long stand n't around . In case , aside two rather lazy cats sudden , n't issue . And course , considering I looking possible third banjo , mandolin may go live case ... Now word open back banjos , considering stand ... First , , I going rest rod 'back-rest ' ( seems like bad idea ) . What I ended adjusting 'back-rests ' resonator bluegrass banjo rested inch bottom , allowing open back rest side ON rest , along lip banjo rim , edge rest foam begins curve . The tail-piece nut two foam pads without touching thing . Seems pretty solid position still engaging weight clamps top.I give 5 stars mainly based excellent quality stand fact ONLY three instrument stand worth kind hoot I able find . Its absolute perfect thing application ( would need three 'back-rests ' independently adjustable height ) , overall I extremely pleased . If like truly value ( usually ) expensive prized instruments , want make sure nothing happens , accidentally otherwise . The Hercules stands much much stable rest . They better base design , even stand inevitably gets bumped wobbling , worries - make sure lower way , designed things awesome . Also , everything fits perfectly Hercules stands . All tri-stands lean instruments toward top much cause headstocks bang together . Not , plenty room everything . This stand ( double version I also ) lets gear hang perfectly straight protects thickly padded stops see near base picture . Also , hanging gravity grasp around neck sweet . With stands I always worried guitar slide , gets bumped could fall . This mechanism holds tight want , releases easily naturally , let go 's sitting . Check things , disappointed.Also , durability , I used abused Hercules stand years , tossing around car play different places . It 's tossed , dropped , setup stowed many times still looks works like I first bought . It n't even obvious visible scratches ( came bag I discarded never used ) . Meanwhile , I gone thru dozens regular cheapo stands years I bought Herc . I every buy Herc stands . 
277	I like product . The screen big easily read . The meter responsive lets know via needle , note ( sharp flat ) background color going green red . It takes 2-3 seconds 'hear ' string locks right notes , even low E. It 's really easy use I 'm really happy . Its much better Korg . The suggestion improvement would another swivel . It takes minute two figure attach guitar head screen right position . An additional swivel would make perfect tunes ukuleles ! tunes guitar ! even see close voice pitch ! hooray tuner . The tuning accurate , LCD screen clearly visible , works great ! ! I 'm sure battery life , I n't gotten yet . This tuner work well . one features one notes full screen . So easy quickly tune . works well honestly better tuners less money . But works well . Good display easy use . The technology fine attachment instrument n't friendly . Snark rotates position I want , Intellitouch ends upside . It works fine 's inconvenient . I PT2 , backlit , I bought one use dimly-lit venues . It worked great right box : put battery , clipped onto standard acoustic guitar headstock , turned , began tuning . The display big ( 1-1/4 '' X 1-1/4 `` ) , bright even bright room , string in-tune , backlit background turns red green ( like Christmas ! ) . I put brand new set strings , used bring one pitch . I found plucking string finger adjusting makes tuner `` waver '' less , probably fewer overtones produced . All type tuners degree hesitancy reading string pitch , strings others , I found unit locked signal quickly gave accurate reading . I use pick pluck string well device , brief pause ( less 10th second ) , gives reading gives green . I n't use features . I also use tune stringed instrument.The comment I button placed top unit clip onto headstock , I mount unit towards one side , turn would highly recommend anyone looking quickly tune-up guitar noisy , dimly-lit room.Update-August 2012 : Replaced battery 2 years , good quality Sony lithium , tuner still going strong ! Not first Intellitouch tuner . I really like tuners , easy use easy see tuning guitar . I bought one year ago I going buy second one keep case back-up . Great tuner , clip headstock , turn tune -- display changes bright green exactly tune I even without glasses . I used noisy environments ( instruments tuning playing ) still works , never problem picking tuning clipped headstock either acoustic guitar Fender ONLY thing could use improvement function ; mine failed detect extended duration NO audio energy , stayed turned drained battery . After , I got habit making SURE I turned use . And uses commonly found 2032 cell batteries A big deal replace ( grab two-pack grocery store keep hand ) .Overall , useful , accurate device worth extra dollars . 
278	I 've recording professionally 27 years ; Music , radio television mostly . So I 'll try give information need make purchase.I 've owned used many mics brands years I ca n't remember I I say I 've never bad 4033 's , 4050 's 's I use every week years , 4033 going back mid 90 's 2020 lower priced electret condenser A-T family . You idea % recordings 're hearing brand , 's used almost every studio every , I work US , attest . But first let tell , simply , negative reviewers went wrong.This XLR connection phantom powered mic , pro best . So requires phantom powered XLR input , pro equipment provides standard home recording audio interfaces . Which really purchase along , n't already , around $ 100 'll improve recording playback preamp monitoring , 'll find one searching audio interfaces . I TRI Audio Focusrite I use playback office den work well n't need Avid HD 's get started . Audio interface another name external sound card provide proper input gain meter . Getting interface away electronically noisy computer since digital . I see small USB mixers available would another option . Do n't try adapter , wo n't work , needs power cord charge field effect transistor , power supplies available adapt however want . It n't come cord , surprise ! Quality cords cost half price , $ 15 version probably n't come purchase one like . Work , may need one recorded vibrations rumbling tell . You 'll need windscreen popper stopper typeShure Popper Pop usual , I also recommend using 2 large $ foam screens top cut one mic side address need cover entire screen . This n't cheap , times goosenecks inconvenient n't work strange angles 'll probably always need one come stand , pick boom stand n't one pay attention negative reviewers tell tip , 18 wheelers also tip sandbag whatever leg opposite mic remove boom top portion slide weight put back together create proper counterweight 've put faux plastic one . If 's possible , could mount boom ceiling run cable hooks , eliminating vibration floor keeping cable wayMicrophone Flange Male . For desktop users , 's I 'd . Using large strips Velcro I 'd fasten Desk Microphone Standand attach thisTelescoping 's another Mics recording progressed meeting needs experimenting , need something figure , clean , quiet recording proof works.I ca n't justify comparing $ 500 $ 4000 mics like better value buy . $ 82 would n't bought case condensers . It sure beats non electret , electrostatic DC bias dynamic style mics . The 2020 certainly entry level professional mic many situations could substituted 4033 without issue . Also individual mics sound , eight 4033 's I , I prefer 3 use . So reviewers say 's bright , I say compared ? I tell sounds like ... ! great sound audio recording . Uh huh , I know one professional recording 's clueless I used $ 82 mic . Think , would good used 40 years ago ? Have heard good 70 's recordings ? Anyone purchasing equipment `` sounds '' better ought earned enough slap cash pay . 's reviewers opinions mic n't ignore ask , formal training experience 200 different mics many studios using expensive gear console monitors reveal true capabilities ? Any noticeable increase sound quality might cost $ 400 wo n't half 'll achieve improving recording technique.This type mic excellent overhead , acoustics , amps brass course vocals , really recording needs , less uni omni , cardioid directional pattern stage mics hyper pattern 's better suited recording . Just understand ca n't get loud near 'll overdrive since 's designed screaming vocals , back loud amps brass , also means need quiet place recording 'll pick AC neighbor 's TV . That , good thing , 's bad trying good recording noisy environment , n't blame mic extraneous room noise . You ca n't use different microphone noise gates processors kind , quiet , anything else sinking ship acoustical , rather electronic , signal noise ratio . A pad reduce output n't affect diaphragm input acoustical foam wo n't help , 's even purpose , I suggest reading acoustics foam , dot -- ( replace [ dot ] ) . Turn , careful headphone bleed recording 3 5 AM , world 's quieter place really help , 'll likely hear loud computer fans . You get underground basement build blanket walls , buy used office need quiet , I 've known acoustic players 've worn gas cut sound breathing . If budget allows 's excellent first step recording type mic likely brand would first choice first recording mic matter cost . I keep saying `` type mic '' reason A-T sells 14 models like style $ 3000 . This model lowest priced 're buying reputable brand . If future plans include using one mic , without ability use traditional recording hardware , look AT2020 USB Condenser USB Technica Cardioid Condenser Microphone w/Pop advice , also lose higher quality playback supplied recording software comes interface . This model pay attention descriptions sounds , I wo n't tell sounds system wo n't apply system goes audio , descriptions worthless , unplugging one piece gear another matters . This important , audio equipment either accurately reproduces n't , recording sound better source , microphone reproduce sound less accurate different microphone . Accurate inaccurate , good bad , 's difference . It 's mix make better different original sound . thoughts home stereo , saying instead , playback sound better recording 's accuracy important search info n't understand n't expect competent engineer without years schooling , training worked professional setting . If 're lucky like I , 1 year tech school I worked site repair ( studios often need PT ) continuing next 3 , 3 years work ( TV ) another year school I became studio owner . Real recording involves facility , equipment techniques involved surgeon . So study electronics , acoustics , auditory , everything audio , train hear smallest sounds day , never stops . When making purchases I recommend reading research realize tool buy tool n't mean 're educated use . So yes , I also n't recommend buying scalpel trying surgery little brother , unless ... everyone us started somewhere get equipment start recording , quit sleeping , eating unnecessary activities read record ! Just short sessions real studio also open eyes educational allow stop talk , I . So keep research man knows I 'm help . If need good , small , inexpensive stereo amp check one . Digital Mini Amplifier Great microphone , I use Behringer mixer , sound good I turn gain pick everything room . It great recording acoustic guitar vocals , n't start layering vocals though , starts sound kind weird . This mike great way start recording home . I use small behringer mixer garageband mac ball . I know nice wiz bang high dollar type maybe others good price . However , I find mic real step using dynamic mikes recording home . great price good mike . I want spend lot start . I got good mike great price ( $ 50 ) At last I got mic month homework condenser mic go . If 're debating Blue Yeti , Snowball , Samson , mic , plenty reviews youtube google . common one people liked regarding affordability sound quality . Microphone quite good price . The sound clear still quite far first class microphones . Recommend small budget studios . Whatever good things 've heard at2020 probably true ! unless 've heard sprout wings save falling sky ... sounds great recording songs ! Haha ! I record fl studio 's even great far ! I recommend get ! ! Love ... nice mic record acoustical instruments ... 13 words ? ... . word word word word word word word word word word ... This exactly I needed price range I could afford crunch . My old mic n't cutting going computers USB audio nice changes sound texture different angles . It really sensitive pop breath pop filter critical vocals . It recording guitar 've even able record nice quick tracks copyright recordings voice guitar . I 've set stand low angled mic towards guitars sound hole ( slightly back ) sing top 45 degrees back little . I found quick comfortable balance result warm clean.I 'm happy unit ( price considered I 'd pay LOT improved ) . I 'll probably get another one . I kind wish I 'd bought combo kit . I use home rough tracks also used work voice . Its worked great . Very happy . Its $ 2000 quality mic good mic money . Some tone little tricky sometimes , price expected sound like butter . I bought gift friend really happy , I completely different view . The AT2020 pretty bright mic sounds good first layer tracks top sound harsh . Second true large diaphragm condenser . It good mic people starting music using podcasts , bunch better mics near price . Two come mind MXL Studio projects ( stay away studio projects C1 ) exceptional microphones price . Although one mic bit expensive absolutely amazing , MXL 2003a . A lot people claimed studio projects C1 sounds like Neumann u87 n't , MXL 2003a however sounds similar easily best LDC mic $ 500 . With said AT2020 bad microphone great , people used built mics computer camera blow away time goes learn limitations fair I lot experience pro audio production , I maybe bit overly critical . One thing sure though ; definitely better mics near price range . Works exceedingly well use . Whether dubbing audio , recording instruments , yelling top . No issues pretty sure I never . 
279	The Fulltone Full Drive 2 another incarnation original Fulldrive . Now MOSFET circuitry available via toggle switch , makes pedal even flexible . Not mention boutique quality working man 's price.This device built solid sports powder blue coat finish . The volume knob gives lots gain , tone knob `` presence '' control , overdrive knob adjusts level overdrive , boost level . Yes , pedal , playing chunky rhythm step `` boost : switch great lead tone.The toggle switch tone drive knobs affect pedals tonal character well knobs affect . There `` comp cut '' allowing cleaner boost , FM `` flat mids , '' `` vintage '' Tubescreamer tone.As bonus , pedal also capable running 18v power cleaner headroom , handy hum bucker scratch , looking perfect OD pedal look Fulldrive 2 . It may wind permanent position pedal board . Holy tone ! Let start saying , I 'm always quest great amazing tone . I think ends . This pedal absolutely remarkable . Built like tank , I 'm pretty sure live . Its full sonic overdrive level , tone overdrive . Almost self explanatory except tone presence knob less EQ total plus book . also mini toggle comp cut , fm , vintage modes . The comp cut clean boost push amps front end , fm really transparent , vintage mode gets creamy midrange , may another tube screamer clone , 's darn great one.The added MOSFET circuitry toggle gives lovely growl low-end fattening , thats cup tea , standard leaves transparent . You know switch effect whole signal , boost side.On negative check pedal , boost ONLY works OD . It boost run series overdrive , additional circuitry add gain OD signal.Another great feature , pedal run different volts standard 9v gets easier breakup , whereas 18v get pedal wo n't leaving board , probably ever . If 're even thinking , ! ! ! You 'll never regret . So far good pedal . Nice clean boost good overdrive sound second stage mainly play relatively clean tube amp use pedal simply cut n't use pedal searing leads ultra dirty sounds - little dirt - two levels it.It makes good single channel amp act like three channel amp far working great ! Main amps - 1960 Bassman - 2012 Fender Hot Rod Deluxe - 1957 Fender - amps sound great pedal - I n't use three time one amps I play out.This pedal versatile lots good sounds probably find something like - I n't think metal well would kick front end good tube amp another level distortion pretty good . ' pedal . You got ta run 18 volts really wake up.This pedal lot various dirty sounds - versatile.I would purchase another I needed every penny . This gear wants versatile overdrive pedal . It 's go light overdrives channel 1 heavy drives boost channel . With mini trim pots add flavor sound.On side , ca n't use boost channel without drive channel . Ever notice every youtube video pedals demoed either Strat Tele ? We debate one thing certain tough get accurate idea LP sound like till unbox . After hours research I decided since seemed lot tuning options I actually found review using LP clean [ ... ] Essentially , get 3 modes varing degrees types OD second boost mode push things even father . What I liked pedal use comp cut flat mids LP increase bottom end mids often Teles Strats need . Hence , go slight boost huge gain without turning mud like pedals . The downside many options constantly playing knobs switches finding new sounds . Works fantastically modeling amps need varying amounts clean dirty OD depending modeling . 
280	This shelf exactly I needed , reasonable price . I used wall-mount rack hold modem router near switch . As added bonus , vent holes bottom , allow heat , also make really convenient ziptie tie-down locations . I 'll definitely buying . We bought rack tray son 's new sound rack . It solid , mounts easily front rails cabinet . It short shelf , goes half-way back rack cabinet . He uses hold wireless receiver guitar amp , along things keeps cabinet . Best price overall value compared name brands . This product exceeded expectation intending buying many many ! Did ton research b4 I bought . I ca n't many manufacturers asking hundreds freaking sheets bent metal ! What racket . If I could make one I would . This one cheap job . . A great deal Amazon , cost lot years ago , appears bought Raxxess manufacturing . The shelf I received slots ( instead bunch screw holes ) , makes really easy mount things . I 'm ordering , thick metal strong enough hold heavy luck good music . It 's bent piece metal conveniently spaced slots sort black coating ... powder coat ? paint ? knows ? 's 's heavy enough n't flex unnecessarily . It heft , 're trying keep rack super light aware . The coating strong . The pre-stamped slots go sideways gear come loose , slips sideways forwards , protecting recently drill additional holes one homemade piece gear totally random mounting hole locations , took get through.I like enough I bought another one . Very good tray put small items . I put switch server components . I recommend I like . Fits well . 
281	Recently I switched Blackstar Fender Mustang III V2 amp . Although Fender great sounding amp , n't get natural warmth get tubes 's 's missing . So , although cleans sound good , n't great . Although overdrive sounds good ... 's great . Although distortion ... well get adding pedal less expensive buying new amp I decided give try . This pedal adds kind sparkle sound would get using clean boost tube amp . I believe people call & # 34 ; pixie dust & # 34 ; ... little bit magic makes sound come enough , I n't leave pedal time . But I stack pedals , use certain effects like chorus , shimmer reverb , effect exception maybe leslie ... 's pretty works different EQ ... tube amp - clean boost may thing ... I think really adds life solid state amps . It 's hard really describe pedal It n't distort , flange , echo , produce chorus . I 'd heard described making amp sound like someone thrown blanket . And words n't accurate job describing , I would probably never pulled trigger one ( even though pretty cheap pedals go ) . As luck would , I acquired one trade , I admit I agree whole blanket . This stompbox helps correct boxy sound Blues Jr. placed end right I run amp . I n't feel needs run dedicated effects loop improve amp 's tone , though I believe works even better loop . I placed effects loop Palomino V8 ( made ) Crate ( 5 watt USA made EL84 tube amp speaker ) transformative amps ' tone ( great way ) . It well single coils . It 's pedal I would leave time tone dialed . I n't think works well I run LP Jet City combo - particularly trying coax subtle textures / harmonics . That amp also lacks effects loop I imagine would different effect placed preamp phase . I guess 's rig dependent , 's keeper sound Fender . This great pedal put end FX chain . I last pedalboard GNX4 . It 's always & took week settle I liked adjusted . There two knobs & I played around untill I happy sound . I lot recording & I also checked sound recording . Ca n't reccomend enough especially considering price . I like . This good pedal end line tone adjustments . Like pedals , 's `` The Pedal '' ( seems like always need another one ) . But add pedals shaping tone . After 've settle setting like , adds subtle , noticeable addition sound . This pedal high , mid , low frequencies yout instrument produces . I also software version effect DAW . This pedal great job giving instrument balanced full tone . When I switch sounds like someone took blanket amplifier . I highly recomend pedal musicians . For jangly pop stuff real peaky , blues material ( think Albert Collins ) , likely add little , I mean A LITTLE , extra oomph sound . It sounds like uses touch reverb dash higher end mids make cleans sound sparkling . But also able get sounds Hughes Kettner 40 60 watt amp , , running straight.To , I heard , adds nothing use fair amount distortion music . It definitely n't add fatness . So overall impression box provides thing people swear get copper arthritis feeling better increased E regimen . In words , matter head suggestable musicians already use EQ reverb careful tweaking two things obtain think 're getting pedal , I think . I 'm going explaining `` science '' behind pedal works . I 'm going focus review pedal affects tone . This definitely n't boost , 's also eq , BBE sonic stomp uniquely functioning pedal . To ear , serves add clarity , depth , body tone . Essentially , pedal allows get tones amp already producing.The lo contour knob n't `` increase '' amount bass produced amp . Rather , tightens generally increases depth bass ( low mid ) tone . To ear may sound first like bass increased , n't . You 're hearing bass tone first place , signal went guitar amp.The process knob really treble high mid frequencies . These frequencies often unpleasant grating hear , sonic stomp sort smooths tones clearer less 's say ca n't dial aggressive cutting highs play lead metal something ; indeed , 'll make searing lead tones even , I gave product 4 stars I 've issues n't way unsatisfied ; rather 's really fairly subtle effect . At first I almost could n't tell difference . With time I 've able better recognize appreciate impact tone , n't make `` night day '' difference.I recommend pedal someone already tone 're happy , want make even better . This pedal wo n't make cheap 15 watt solid- state combo sound like tube half-stack . It wo n't make love tone completely unsatisfied conclusion , though I definitely would n't put pedal `` must '' category , definitely improves quality tone . This pedal I leave time , improves clean distorted tones . This pedal adds `` I n't know '' sound.I chased sound years buying pedal - difference.If great , top quality cable , quiet amps pedal boards , shielded guitars , fresh tubes - know drill - spend thousands chasing something hear head - plug one pedal ! ! - ! It THIS pedal - turn knobs `` '' comes speakers.A must - especially playing clubs , bars - pedal board - looking sound gon na finally push sound front - give notes clarity leads - make overdriven chords ring.I like pedal - 's board - 's never coming . Back 90 's I used Ampeg guitar head effects loop . I discovered rack version BBE music store amazed money . The amp I totally bad ass Fryette Deliverance 120 , sadly effects loop . So I thought I luck far BBE goes , far I knew available rack mount units could placed anywhere effects loop . Then I looking pedals Amazon , lo behold , BBE Sonic pedal ! I snatched quickness I pleased sounds good rack version . One signal noisy BBE actually increase signal noise . For reason I highly recommend using top quality patch instrument cables clean noisy aspects sound use . This pedal subtle , audiophile like absolutely essential . It also works great ANY instrument sound system . It 's also great vocals well . But may want rack version applications . I would also buy rack version I effects loop run . IMO , pedal really folks effects loop still like BBE . I 'd go rack ease use keeping proper place signal chain . Plus get stereo rack version two BBE 's much money use another application .

283	pleased , seller fine , prob . , mic use useless , records tooo low , cant get enough volume I used alot different mics years mic drums , Microphone actually good enough vocals sounds decent I would reccommend anyone budget wants good peice sound equipment . bought son game capture voice overs . first day fine , bit sensitive , third day broken . cheap buy , cheaply made . No problems seller product came quick . I wasnt expecting much mic . I mean c'mon expect price . I wanted lay quick vocal melodies rough tracks 's good enough . Does n't really great range , I think mic better range , like I said , 's cheap mic expect . Honestly I saved money little patient get better mic . This really nice microphone . It sounds really good worth far exceeds minimal price . I would buy . I 'm surprised maker Amazon 's popular AT2020 would go low . The mic , imo , , even single-digit price . It 's `` dynamic '' rather `` condenser , '' still requires loads power get workable levels ( phantom power , requirement condenser mics , would probably add sufficient heft ) . It 's lightweight , optional plug on/off switch , versatile enough . The quality sound , moreover , n't bad -- providing hear . Be prepared plenty watts hand coax appreciable sensitivity non-responsive . ( I n't tested recording purposes . ) Despite appearances , mic bargain .

286	I difficulty hearing cheaper units market . This metronome 2 distinct audible sounds flashing light makes much easier see hear beats . Works well . Very nice metronome enough features . In particular I love name based tempos displayed face , many metronomes feature . standard music stand fine without falling . My music teacher recommended metronome really like . It 's heavy use ( hours per day ) ever since got many months ago I n't think 've even replace batteries yet . It 's got good loud sound easy kids adjust . We tried free metronome apps volume n't loud enough kids ( though adept touch screens ) found tricky adjust . This one great . The tuners I modes use metronome .

287	I 've using primarily Alchemy strings years got tired spending much . I figured I 'd try others half price see stack up.These first go , HUGE step I . The strings I took probably two months old spots corrosion high E string . They twice loud . When take pack , sort flop like wet spaghetti . They n't fast unravel thing strings typically . The cons definitely outweigh pros : flexible , string bends : -The dull sound strings I 've ever heard . Especially low end . They 're lacking rich low end sound . The highs tinny . Almost sounds like bad recording.-Your fingers stick try slide strings . It 's weirdest thing . This especially true G string . It 's hard explain , 's kind like rubbing something really clean , hand skipping sort rub 's tons squeak boot . Anyways , sucks . Grip last thing want strings.Bottom line : Unless wicked arthritis super easy bend strings , purchased . I 'll never buy . This first time life I wanted change brand new strings . The reason called silk phosphor wound strings silk along steel cores ( wire around windings wound ) rather steel . This allows tune pitch less tension , ideal string beginner someone moving nylon . There also silk steel strings silver plated copper windings . The lower tensions light gauges mean may drive guitar tops hard enough let perform capability . That , may sound soft cheap . I would put Martin dreadnoughts , example . But may work fine lightly guitars . The way find sure experiment , I usually use silk-and-steel guitar banjo , time change strings , I stumbled across . I 'll see things settle , far I 'm willing give silk-and-phosphor nod silk-and-steel . The sound bit brighter . My music partner says prefers way silk-and-phosphor blend `` '' I wo n't let influence rating . My guitar-banjo 's tailpiece small holes strings must pass . The ends windings bottoms bare steel 1st 2nd strings stick bit , I trouble putting . I able use fine wire cutter nip end 1st string , n't work 2nd string . I ended using D'Addario string gauge place . Admittedly , tight fit , I able put without working . What 's love strings ? The sound fantastic ... ring like . But fret hand longer gets tired playing night long . These sound feel good nothing spectacular report.Had make adjustments eliminate sound OK I recently itching buy classical guitar , 's I learned child . I ca n't afford moment , I decided give shot.These turn steel string classical guitar stretch imagination . I n't expect - guy dream , ca n't ? Anyway , provide warm clear sound normally Takamine . It also helped rather high action . They play sound softer . It 's almost like new stringing/stretching process I broke G string ( go easy , silk ) use standard bronze replacement . I asked oriented girlfriend could pick ' string got right first try.. 's much difference strings make . They sound less ' - may sound obvious point 's big difference , enough untrained ears 'm still saving classical , I really love strings , using Tak going forward . These strings soft touch almost feel like `` flat-wound '' acoustic guitar strings . When uncoil wrapper n't spring like strings sort flop like string string instead wire wrapped wire . They sound wonderful I swear feel easier play I things I usually pretty clumsy . They wo n't last long course depth character worth checking may find , like , 's worth going back changing every weeks get fresh sound . If 're really acoustic guitar aficionado , 'll want try . The almost play IMO . And makes want play twice long .

289	Even though title says `` Acoustic Guitar Case '' , 's obvious case A-style mandolins . I chose lining looked little deeper photo , reviews good . Sure enough , lining soft well-padded . The hardware works , build quality almost perfect . However , closing case , small amount required make top seat bottom properly . Just slight push-pull motion allow top snap place , everything . The case fits mandolin perfectly , provides protection needed safely transport car trunk place bumped around . The slight top bottom big enough concern warrant returning case . It serves purpose well , reasonable price . I VERY satisfied hard shell A-style mandolin case ; I received prompt delivery , reasonably priced , quality product ; thanks ! I bought case Rogue A-style electric inside nicely lined ; hardware solid.It came great low price feel cheap.I recommend anyone A-style Great case well made great padding construction seems good I complaints product ! ! ! ! !

Amazon correct this.Stagg Acoustic Guitar Case Epiphone Dot , Sheraton , 335 I received case today , soonest delivery day estimation range ( plus ! ) . Now spent long time pricing hard cases around internet , price extremely reasonable wonderful case . Nothing fancy differs slightly pictured item outside rim-threading basic locks ( keys included ) gold toned ( instead silver toned pictured ) , n't mean . Plush interior small , yet roomy , compartment located neck . I primarily 5-string banjo player , decided casually play around mandolin , I figured I better get hard case possible `` long-time '' storage ( first banjo lived padded gig bag years I started getting serious ... boy , best thing small enclosed storage spaces ) . This case definitely trick . Excellent value ! - note , bit extra play around peg-head ( I mandolin ) ... I see someone traveled case dropped hard enough , peg snapping may occur . But , simple storage/protection , non-issue .

292	I usually play Jazz Bass fingerstyle , songs I prefer pick , especially I need speed accuracy . Until I found hard Wedgie rubber pick , I used heavy Fender pick , n't like sharp pick sound much.I bought set soft , medium hard Wedgie picks try I 'm really happy results . I greatly prefer soft Wedgie Uke , I like medium nylon string guitar hard Wedgie 's really nice Jazz Bass . I still use hard plastic picks electric steel string acoustic guitars , Wedgie 's fantastic I need fingerlike sound instruments . I prefer 3.1mm wedgie picks since 5mm picks feel bit thick tastes , 's entirely subjective.I 'd love see slightly larger version pick someday , still works well . style work ok. thought would give try . shipping quick know lot players like Playing acoustic ukulele nylon strings , I 've preferred strum using fingers `` traditional '' plastic picks harsh loud . Even felt picks harsh ( mention ) .The Wedgie EXACTLY I 've looking . thumb , softer plastic felt , 3.1mm Hard Rubber Wedgie pick ; right butter zone.I tried `` Soft '' `` Medium '' , soft . The Soft Wedgie strings winds dragging producing dull tone . The Medium better , still dull action bit soft.But Hard Wedgie clear winner . I get great volume tone without harsh twang plastic nylon strings.The negatives I 've found are:1 . They leave skid marks pick guard . No big deal , wipes right off.2 . They break faster I 'd like . Of course , could , 're looking softer-than-plastic pick , one get . No pick noise , strings . I could n't happier . I bought one Soft , Medium Hard Wedgie rubber picks even though colours right , Hard soft Soft . They felt exactly fact . The Medium hardest error ? I idea . The fact stiffness comes one colour colours right lead think something wrong manufacturing . So check wise , rubber really removes treble acoustic guitar , making sound really dull lot friction rubber strings I think idea strumming.The reason I think using want reduce noise frankly , would much control used fingers instead . I purchased picks , I play bass alternate punk metal band . We play drop tuning playing plastic nylon pick creates alot noise . I hoping picks would stop pick noise . They n't make annoying plastic metal sound , flexible . I need alot pick speed . These slow way much . The reviews I read stated like rigid picks , . Too bad high picks n't tremolo pick , good . I read reviews carefully - 's definitely something different , sturdy , rubber bits come strum , complaints skid marks strings fingers . Ouch ! I 'm much happier Friday picks - experiment worked ! And cares hard pick sounds anyway ? If want something sounds like fingers strumming , n't use & # 8230 ; fingers ? This fun pick . I play lot fingers thumb thought I 'd give try . Its great ! I love tone pick striking strings . I love way transmits feel strings . More organic plastic picks . Yes might crumble play hard . I think play hard pick would thumb 'll fine . Its lot fun little price open playing different tones instrument . Worth try .

294	I 've pedal year I 've getting tube amps I 've learned appreciate gear works together ( amps , guitars pedals ) .When I first reviewed pedal , I gotten new solid state amp I let . After I jumped tube amps , I grew appreciate little bit , I using wrong ; I 'd match output amp goose distortion level use 2nd stage . I thought lent good distorted tone playing , I `` OK '' forward : This thing kills ! It belongs front tube amp ; period . I 've found , , dirt boxes virtually useless solid state amps.The D III works well clean boost : Max volume , set tone taste roll distortion way back . This blast clean amp overdrive , without much coloration tone . This preferred setting I use push single channel tube amps dirty territory like I would , using second channel , natural tube sound . Any pedal gives `` umph '' without altering original sound amp beautiful thing.Dial output , crank volume amp bit , distortion knob really adds nice saturated gain increases sustain creep getting significantly dirtier tone . I found reminiscent classic tube screamer ; tonally identical , really help push hotter amp overdrive get heavy , heavy tones , retaining sound amp 's natural , dial classic crunch tones suitable rock blues smooth overdrive . After playing around knobs , I found versatile well voiced pedal . I actually prefer tube screamers clones 's done death ; D III , sounds `` different '' TS n't let go low price , fantastic buy . It delivers enough output used fantastic clean boost , 's enough gain tap dial rock tone 'd want , save modern high gain metal . MXR make pretty good Pedals money . I thought would high output , saturated type distortion . It . It plent Volume , good boosting . But , even Gain Knob turned way , thing Overdrive . Which bad thing , 's looking . Very sound well . Just . But 's well built would make decent OD . But , overall , pretty Dirt Pedal . I looking Overdrive Distortion pedal classic rock , I finally decided one . It 's decent pedal , solid . However , VERY noisy buzzy use , although distortions . It sounds little bit thin hollow ears ; 's ok , I ; purchase really record . It 's light thin sounding . I 'm probably going get OCD something like instead This another MXR `` Distortion '' line . The Distortion III overdrive flavor high gain pedal like Boss Metal Zone Barber Dirty flexible . Not really heavy metal ( see MXR Fullbore Metal ) AC/DC classic rock sound.There lot gain tap output section possible hit front tube amp hard without turning distortion . The tone knob dramatic sweep useable.The good thing pedal apart price get `` fizzy '' top end pedals crank distortion . In addition , pedal cleans nice roll back tone true bypass pedal board friendly . I use guy Fender Twin , since Overdrive sound enough days metal . Not much noise practical carry . If really want go something bit & # 34 ; Marshall JCM900 like & # 34 ; ... get MXR Custom Badass '78 Distortion . For extreme ... get Riot ! I looking crunchy type distortion like overdrive . I n't hold pedal though . I Marshall Class 5 pedal actually sounds little bit like overdrive I get amp , I say compliment . In case , however , would I want replicate I already ? I 'm gon na return save money get BB preamp . You check Distortion MXR .

The bar-gooseneck arrangement sturdy enough mic model.This also works well mounting microphone stands . I use shorter gooseneck mount DM70 tenor alto saxophones , DM80 baritones . Again , works perfectly situations.I always keep , plus various size goosenecks , case I need mount additional microphone I short stands . It 's one tool make set less stressful.Trust , need one ( chances 're drummer sound tech ) thank foresight purchase situations I I . Really great clamp , vertical pipe securely , great quality . A nice addition collection . I highly recommend . I 'm used mic extension uses short gooseneck . problems set . Then I saw . No bendable problems , I really love extensions . Ive good success piece . I use straight mic stand topped Shure Super 55 vocals . I put Heil Fin boom arm mic tenor sax . The arm allows variety positions , serves eliminate second stand horn mic . My ( small ) & # 34 ; concern & # 34 ; length arm . If bit shorter , adjustable , would help offset ( potential ) balance issue created mic hang far stand . In case , I using heavy microphone , I n't rate product reason ( I know Im pushing issue ) . I doubt someone attaching lighter microphone arm , would issue . That said , 's great way get rid second unnecessary stand cluttering stage . We ended buying total 4 stage ton floor space . A highly recommended piece . Have n't long , far , 's perfect . I bought another On-Stage side boom earlier greatly disappointed flimsiness ( On-Stage MY550 - see review ) . This one hand rock solid much adjustable , AND costs bucks ( present ) . I 've got 13 '' gooseneck condenser mic shock-mount , 's steady . I 'm convinced even heavier loads problem . If 're need side boom , look . I use position iPad way 's sight-line audience , 's also great drums . Sturdy , flexible well designed . Lots metal needs metal . Buy , 'll glad . 
301	I put Ibanez acoustic-electric cosmetic upgrade tone sustain absolutely amazing , mention look fantastic . They fit like made bridge rubbed bit pine tar holes q-tip make sure seated fully . Absolutely tickled look performance . VERY HIGHLY RECOMMEND I automatically put guitar I soon I buy , I change strings toss white plastic pins . Makes guitar look much classier ! I swear slight increase richness tone ! value , tons bang buck They look good ... Installed easily 3 different guitars far . I n't thought buying bridge pins , metal pins apparently add bit brilliance tone guitar , 's great bonus ! I bought original plastic bridge pins snapping I n't like plastic ones available local music store . I 'm happy I bought ! Adds little sustain look sharp , , put Martin D-35 , Epiphone Washburn Travel Series , , , , nice . These look great guitar . I hoping would help make guitar sound brighter defiantly n't . I would recommend look great . The ones I got look almost exactly ones picture . I use pins 3/4 size guitars . Not really sure I notice difference sound , plastic , ebony pins I attractive certainly appear different . I put `` campfire acoustic '' Black Yamaha F335 look stunning . The tone seems slightly brighter , however , I go strings pretty fast lot difference I hearing admittedly likely result going dead strings new strings . Since replacing plastic pins I going skip scientific analysis give subjective `` sounds good '' .These pins little thin ( small ) may slide hole easier ones replacing . If need remedied applying small amount tape pins . This may necessary , however , even slightly loose pins used correctly wedge keep string hole . The string go way hole , body guitar . Insert string sure ball inside body least inches , possible listing toward neck . Then insert pin slot facing neck push firmly . Unless really thick strings slots ample . Then gently pull string tight making sure ball grab end pin . Instead body guitar stopped escaping back hole pin . The pin really holding place . Usually pins popping ball actually hooked onto end pin pulling hole . If avoid also avoid frustrating mishap pin come flying poking eye 're trying get guitar tune ( typically ruining brand new string process ) . If get hand inside guitar feel ball end string able feel sitting body ( correctly ) hanging pin ( incorrectly ) . Also tone tuning stability improved making sure proper string fit guitar snugly tightly , however I problems popping despite fact I lot string bending whole step ( sometimes using two fingers ' strength bend far ) . Overall I quite pleased . Impressed set , I installed today playing hours . My wife thinks guitar looks better , I agree . Im sure supposed flush , stick little bit popped . I think guitars tone improved little , I also installed new strings . way better plastic pins ! These pins amazing . One u never worry breaking . They look really nice add noticeable sustain . Very cool . 
302	use acoustic guitar sounds great , price quality sound get better pedals joyo pedals definitely best price quality.thank u guys . I Behringer products never encountered issues operating . I use power snake instead batteries I comment battery life compartment access . The box plastic really . I ordered pedal based previous review , sounds cheap faint . I Behringer pedals many good price , one I wo n't keeping . To , n't even close good get Fender amps TC Electronics Delay pedal ( includes chorus/vibrato ) , I thought I would go solo pedal , 's go ... Needed chorus tone fit budget . I owned multiple Behringer products trust brand . It plastic casing I n't tour wo n't problem - I needed effect gives . Fully adjustable depth , tone , warble volume . Do n't spend $ 200 'boutique ' pedal - get one . I wanted add chorus effects chain since I mostly Behringer products ( satisfied pedals ) decided try . Again I satisfied . A chorus n't something use time I expect one give years good Behringer reliability service . For someone looking extra color sound try pedal.I think 'll pleasantly surprised sure ca n't beat price . A great value money . 
303	The Pyle-Pro mic stand good someone looking buy budget . It 's fairly solid , heavy enough hold , flexible enough position mic need it.There issues , however . The metal neck difficult tighten onto base without causing microphone crooked . This means choose straight forward mic mic n't swivel around base . The mic holder issue.I would use mic stand event 's visible audience . It simply difficult position look good would use mic stand personal voice recording communication . It 's great desk small recording studio . Perfect obscure use.I discarded mic clip ( , added collection , ) attached mount gooseneck . Now I universal articulating mount flexible post . What ? I use contraption watch movies ipod touch long . No holding little thing face hours end . This stand mount get small screen right line vision . What say something need really insignificant scheme things . I needed works simple It 's always problem trying keep Desk microphone one place . resolved , purchasing stand heavy stays one place . The thing I wish flex little longer , three inches would great . But otherwise wise good purchase . This shows , simple small mic stand dont fall . Good table top , hole floor recording.Its well made works well . 
304	My band playing one night , I use amp stand stage . I really liked elevating little amp helped improve 's sound decided I one . I started searching around found product . The price right I took chance purchased one sight unseen . The Musician 's Gear stand everything I needed . It arrived three days well packaged easy assemble . It 's light weight , portable well constructed would safely support amp 75lbs . I would recommend product anyone amplifier 75lbs less . I 'm enjoying . I actually bought keep amp floor I also like puts amp angle pointing upwards . It 's supporting 50 pound amp easily n't tilted back fallen . I 'm glad I bought would buy company . Thank You . It 's sturdy , well made , cheap . You could n't go buy raw material put something like together pay . I 've used couple amps 'll handle say AC30 without issues . Expect less price . Excellent , fine manufacturing , good finish . Perfect Line 6 , 75 wt . It works well heights . Although I never gigged I think would great musician gigs 2x12 2x10 combo amp . I used various fender line 6 amps worked great amplifying sound . Would buy given circumstance . If looking get 3 amps flood . I 2 12 & # 34 ; amps big Fender DSP 212 . I using amps . It works well . I recommend job $ $ . I sure I would use $ 1,200 4x12 cabinet Great deal price sturdily made . Easy assemble feels solid . Way cheaper I saw Guitar Center . Im pleased stand . I bought two . I use stand smaller 50 watt Fender amp . I n't think I would recommend larger amplifiers , especially since sits little high , amp , 's perfect . Nevertheless , I also n't really plan packing moving stand around much , I ca n't imagine ideal portability . If music studio recording and/or rehearsing playing gigs , really nice stand . This stand easily supports 50 poundFender Frontman 212R Guitar Combo height setting . In fact , even extended highest stand supports amp issues center gravity weight distribution love ease setting breaking stand . It essentially three parts : base two removable arms . Granted heavy , added weight thing built like tank.In addition rock solid , parts mate perfectly slop tolerances . The support arms slide base friction excess movement , height adjustment three nicely spaced positions . You merely pull back spring loaded knobs release safety pins engage arms position . Once line holes , release knobs pins solidly engage hold amp complaint - wish - tilt stand fixed angle . I would love I could adjust , I sure would drive price stand . One final note : significantly increase footprint amp stage . Specifically , increases depth dimension nearly 100 % Frontman 212R , although difference length nominal . I mention factor normally play small venues cramped stages.Overall , excellent stand one stable heavy-duty . At current price ( time review ) 's bargain . Needed stand lift PA mixer floor safety ease use . For $ 20 , sturdy little unit collapses nicely transportation . But definite tipping risk used anything higher lowest height setting.I took lead reviewer Jones `` removed upper brackets inserted longest bars horizontal instead vertical , although amp stable , I still n't feel stable enough set highest setting . '' I using lowest height stable , I highly recommend heavy sandbag back height setting used.I give four stars great value $ 20 , suit needs well . Nice little amp stand . I wish looked little classier guess 's probably people like gigging music room . lot vibrations apartment building . A bit heavy n't fold compact like better options ... Would love aluminum one could fold real compact ... It 's perfect hold amp tilt bit toward ceiling . Great price , great stand . What I need say ? ? ? Although , I pedal board 8 effect pedals , additional effects amplifier . I easily turn press desired effect amp button . Is sturdy good price . 
305	I love tone ! research though ! Plenty distortion , plenty bass treble , makes tubescreamers sound like band pass filter ! I dozen overdrive pedals . I know insane . best I best ever heard . I use low gain overdrive boost leads . It great job . tons tonal options . If I buy one od pedal would After researching overdrive pedals seemed like forever , I chose Fulltone OCD . The reviews Amazon helped well , along Youtube demos guitar mags . What finally made choice I found Robin Trower used one last 2 U.S. tours befor Fulltone made sig , pedal versatile overdrive . The HP/LP switch alone gives distinct tone solos rhythm , tweaking dials adds fun ( I 'm constantly playing tones ; minor adjustment makes huge difference ) . The coolest thing pedal responsive playing dynamics ; picking softly dials OD , unleash crunch harder attacks ... much better trying roll-off volume . The true-bypass great , lose original signal engaged . As , favorite piece 're looking massive distortion , keep looking . But ' pedal quite time . : Nice thing 's fairly transparent - 's changes top/bottom end tone knob ca n't fix , 's fairly good transitions area . All gain pedals gain - transitions dirt clean sets apart ... handles well . Pluck string let sit , slowly cleans . Some pedals slowly cleans point goes said , setting volume way , drive way , roll bit tone knob 11:00 , using switch - front end Mesa Boogie = pure . That 's sound I 've looking amp ! So far I 've used amps , , far , I 've found unusable even one-trick pony . I 'm impressed , says lot someone years ago , hated idea putting anything guitar amp ... amp could n't ' comes dirty tone ... 's wrong amp ... I still think way , good pedal front add nice twist ... goose front end bit shifting channels might Dr. ordered ... I admit . I tried pedal guitar besides Strats . But pedal gives everything I want.The best way I describe sound OCD Quality Clean uses pedal less drive clean boost tube amp , notice delivers strong character guitar sensitive dynamics playing.As loved Ibanez TS9 allows strat keep vocal type midrange singing trebles . When add drive TS9 , retains characteristics industry standard strat guitarists want keep stratty character get quality sound tube amp.The reason OCD preferred pedal TS9 let low end distort early . The TS9 allows lower notes distort earlier seems amplify signal . The OCD gives fattest low end tons tone . If like blues hard rock , notice feature exactly wanted give playing really strong character . You gain low end gain crunch , biggest tone could dream use pedal HSS strat blues Jr III use clean boost coolest clean tone ever . It allows playing dynamics drive amp , clipping pedal . When I playing heavier blues rock stuff , I turn drive highest quality sound I ever played with.The HP/LP switchShifting HP almost like gain boost . I heard described switching American sound ( LP ) British sound ( HP ) . I guess decent description . I found I get thick ballsy sound LP I n't lose quality HP . It feels like get boost conclude , I would say pedal perfect mix ballsy overdrive quality tone . If quality amp quality guitar , reason try save $ 30 buying Ibanez TS9 TS808 . This pedal make lot happier like keep low end intact allow break early making whimpy . I picked pedal used along DS-1 Keeley modded distortion pedal entirely knowing think . Long story short , mod DS-1 getting returned I 'm keeping Fulltone , word negative reviews ... tells something small people completely trash something , 13 reviews ( Sept. 2012 ) 5-star reviews . It tells people ripped tone pedal n't know pedal tried . And anyone complaining price - pedal extremely well constructed ( inside circuitry pristine ) built last decades . I think ratings reflect quality first , let 's talk pedal sounds ! It 's marketed overdrive/distortion . I lot people try steer away I indicated I looking distortion pedal , I actually quite surprised much gain sustain pedal . It much `` overdrive '' sense keeps tonal characteristics guitar amp , boosts level gain full , rich sound . The sound lot `` bass '' , unlike Tubescreamer ( TS-9 ) , 's definitely `` muddy '' . In fact , 're tired distortion pedals sounding tinny weak combo act , might exactly battery accessible behind 4 hand screws moderately involved get , AC adapter really way go . It 's standard plug like find BOSS Ibanez pedals , use 9V 18V . I 've read reviewers say 18V gives headroom , actually prefer 9V sound . Honestly , I tried n't discern difference - probably matters loud volumes , switch , 's really matter preference setup use . I 've mostly using LP setting , plenty output avoids shrill highs I hate . But live setting ( use boost soloing ) , HP setting could quite useful , designed emphasize mids highs `` cut '' instruments stage.If I summarize pedal , I would describe Tubescreamer rock . Which say 's `` better '' Tubescreamer , necessarily , definitely larger range gain tone . Put pedalboard may find using go-to rhythm/chord sections , soloing , . I like lot pedal . It 's deep overdrive . I 'm using supply power , fat overdrive . I 'm using TS808 front OCD ... 
306	It exactly represented . It fine job . I used recording live band practice sessions . I would necessary purchase item . This another adapter I rarely use I digital mixer I sure I ever get much use rig . use rig though never know might run I plan keeping little artifacts longer . You ca n't many adapters sound guy . This handy gadget converts balanced unbalanced mic cable unbalanced 1/4 '' jack . Simple works . I 've got couple kit say come handy working unknown equipment . I n't need anything high dollar I needed . Does cheaper feel ( much expensive units I 've used ) . These plugs well made serve purpose intended . If I buy future I checking first . Took find I needed I needed ! Free shipping . Exactly I needed great price ! I notice mixed reviews . I suppose item sells $ 2 instead $ 20 may potential quality control issues . But hey , buy 3 even one turns bad , 're still way ahead deal . Seems good connector I 've ever bought .

309	I well pleased quality performance cables . I used bands PA system work nicely . I would recommend anyone looking quality affordable price . I liked . Very useful connecting rack components . Great idea different colors . I buy . I purchased various lengths GLS cable patch rack equipment . They well made , reliable cost effective . The XLR connectors secure I could n't purchase cable connectors build less . The colors make easy identify patches quickly especially dim light . I use patch four ports 4 Channel Active Direct Box Direct DI two Mic Tube Stereo Tube Microphone mixer . First , size perfect rack configuration . The cables easily reach , color coding makes snap see glance connected . That great improvement tags labels require get close read.What makes bargain construction . The insulators tough easily nick dragged around rough stages . However , 's attention small construction details I love . The XLR ends quality components , cheap , ill fitting junk companies use keep costs . And unlike cheap ones mate disengage smoothly . Another factor strain reliefs end . Those keep conductors fraying breaking inside cable , often occur cable ends cables without them.Overall cable set constructed withstand frequent set-up teardown , built last . If shopping patch cables size great value opinion probably replace years . sound techs like make things simple easy work , XLR jumper cables way go , quality impressive . I used new set wireless mike jump 16 channel board easy , mikes color coded cable fitted right color code thus making easy identify easy control mixing board .

It used often , works beautifully . I use wind strings ! I recommend use stringing guitar easily fast . Very easy use ! This great winder . Steel shaft probably come standard issue every guitar . Unquestionably top-of-the-line manual string winder , still user must careful scratch guitar 's headstock . On tuners might work great , various mine , still sloppy . For I 'll stick good old fashioned fingers thumb . It sturdy , well made , feels hefty hands , extremely smooth action - everything Shubb winder , made China , Shubb made USA .

312	I paid $ 29 small convenient . I impressed sound.At first I played Line 6 15 watt amp . I n't like cause squealing . But I read use . Boy ! It worked great.I use Tascam US 100 USB plugin computer I get good sound practice.I still like Line 6 amp though sounds sustain . But bargain small.You use USB audio like AC/DC would like . There different amp sounds convenient opinion sounds best USB guitar audio device US 100 . Great bang buck clone Tech 21 GT-2 . This pedal build quality GT-2 controls identical sounds darn good ( especially pocket change charge ) . I done comparison two pedals I comment close actual circuits components . The TM300 distortion box . It 's like preamp . I find convincing mid scooped Twin type clean well decent Marshall type growl . I find Mesa least authentic though unpleasant distortion n't sound like Mesa imho . If looking triple rec distortion probably better dirt boxes . I actually criticism Tech 21 ( really excellent pedal ! ) The TM300 works well running amp simulate mic 'd cab also run directly PA mixer bypass amp completely . This thing actually takes pedals reasonably well . It really breath new life mediocre practice amp ( solid state ) . It also stowed bag easily enough n't lug backup amp gigs . I find much realistic sounding digital modelers n't quite 100 % replicate sound touch sensativity tube amp pushed ( n't invented yet opinion ) . It n't replace tube amp personally running straight PA lugging amp impractical no-brainer . Five stars price . If hobbyist weekend warrior pedal cover bases . If make living live performances ( price decision making ) I would advise pony extra money Tech 21 product overall build quality much higher ( regards enclosure , switch , knobs , jacks ) , customer service top-shelf right NYC . I three Tech 21 pedals previously owned Trademark 60 amp I attest difference overall build quality products Behringer 's . Sound-wise similar though I DO much love inexpensive Behringer pedals . I close dozen I encountered single malfunction 2 years . I read reviews product decided lot reviewers probably know guitar effects I since people seemed like , I figured I 'd give try . I disappointed . It gives great sound solos . I 've tried different kinds genres found 's quite versatile . I still play settings bit really get sound I want , I think 's learning effects box provides . upon looking another pedal . I read reviews decided give chance ; could I lose price ? I put cart continued shopping.Guess ... reviewers n't lying ( except one guy gave BS review ) ! It arrived today , I decided give quick workout . I grabbed small amp ( Fender Frontman 15 ) plugged Strat ( Seymour Duncan bridge ) gave go . The workout ' turned hour long jam session I got caught pedal . It turned little solid state amp fire breather ! With mic X , middle set Hot , California 3/4 gain ... thing solos heavy rhythm . I spent good deal time setting away.The Tweed Brit settings great , I tweaked multitude tones beast . I 've Behringer pedals even though decent ( vintage delay , slow motion , compressor , eq ) , I n't get excited . In fact , I sold delay slow mo recently . This pedal however , going get serious use . I 'm crazy plastic casing , seems sturdy enough . I ca n't recommend pedal enough ... reviews right ! You wo n't sorry . Its one great modeler , like tweed old tube sound mic position using bass , gives really clean treble distortion like also , try bass like . I n't lot experience effects stomp boxes , enough know I winner . Behringer 's TM300 made tough plastic . The 3 I year n't look warn scarred , sound good day I got . The tube mode pedal incredible flavor tones . Fender clean , bright , British crunch distortion , hot Gain sweet smooth California sound . I playing Peavey , I hear tweed . Amazing clarity , worth $ 28 change . You wo n't disappointed . Good price sound . Classic behringer plastic housing I n't problem ever I n't dog stuff ... built analog drives , nicer crunch dirt 's flexible . Fair say real tube best , analog practice amps put life tone . Ca n't say metal I 'm , everything else find fits bill . I bought product one reason : I several amps guitar amps , stereo , clean , high powered , two channels , I want use guitar amps , either primary backup . This tube modeler acts first pre-amp , adds gain , volume control , `` crunch '' , whatever , non-guitar amps make sound like guitar amps . I n't really care tube amps models , mic placement , I want guitar amp sound style . I also use front Behringer DI box , DI box splits signal coming TM300 sends half non-guitar amps guitar speakers stage , half house PA . I n't think many people would this.The sound get box affected amp , kind amp driving , also kind speakers amp driving . The acoustics space playing also affects sound , I 've used box settings driving PA amps , home stereo amps , bass amps , guitar amps , drove PA speakers , bass speakers Eminence Commonwealth 12 guitar speakers , acoustic space . Each combination amp speaker settings box held constant , sound different : like guitar amps speakers , . As I said , I n't really care tube amp modeled , I get authentic guitar speaker sound box . It works me.I read reviews say digital knockoff analog Sansamp GT2 , based performance far , served kind like cheap preview Sansamp . I would consider getting GT2 future , product , , poor man 's tube amp . 
313	This second 4 way switch wo n't last . The four way gives added combination neck bridge series , gives fatter tone position 2 output positions , 3 . I pleased & # 34 ; new sound & # 34 ; tele . The wiring diagram easy understand install pretty easy soldering gun . ( n't forget lay protect guitar finish solder ) . This switch work , look leap . The switch travel greater standard 3-way switch , use common Fender replacement control plate ( one intended 3-way switch , may fit . You could fairly easily alter plate , want cleanest look possible may want investigate new control plate . Recently , I building Telecaster project . A friend recommended using 4 way switch instead stock 3 way switch . This allows three positions normally found Telecaster , bridge , bridge + neck parallel , neck . It also adds ability add setting bridge neck pickups series.The result added position get higher volume output guitar regular bridge + neck position slightly higher top end output . This clearly case & # 34 ; mileage may vary. & # 34 ; I 've used traditional switch Telecasters . I 'm bit mod . If I building another guitar , I would probably use switch . It supposed within couple dollars 3-way . However , I would change working 3-way switch . For , added benefit n't worth effort . The diagram comes switch tell side use . Both sides five tabs look diagram given matter way turn . I figured would go way three-way - wrong . You think Fender would sense figure , give us proper diagram , guess . Just another example Fender . Great solid switch . Works well giving Telecaster option run pickups series parallel . As questioned travel much switch plates I say I several Teles I never problem switch travel much plate .

315	This review theMahalo Painted Economy Soprano Ukulele ( Pink ) .For price ( $ 30 shipped ) ca n't beat . Free shipping via Amazon Prime . I got daughter christmas , loves ! I taught , I play ... play `` Anyone else . '' It 's great little starter musical instrument , great beater uke I n't mind getting bit banged up.I surprised frets level neck straight ( well , good enough cheap uke ) . The strings kind cheap nylon . I changed strings , sound better ... almost good laminate mahogany soprano ( almost ) . The fretboard painted black , I n't know kind wood used ( I n't expect ebony price ) . I also sanded nut saddle action bit high , even I play without complaining much . It geared tuners , friction even comes matching polyester `` gig-bag . '' Now mother wants one play granddaughter . Overall , decent play/starter uke worth $ 30 . For price , steal . If , snag pack new strings sound tremendously better . All new strings I spent $ 30 uke I think ca n't get new strings , ones come survive little ( stock strings instrument never great ) . Also , n't know tune n't tuner , n't need buy one ; smartphone iPod touch accurate tuning apps nearly instrument , ukulele included ! A little back story : I used play instruments I younger stopped preteens/early teens . It 's something I 've recently regretting ever . So , I 'm fixing ! Not I relearning instruments I played , I picked new one - ukulele ! Like many others , I inspired ; ) Back review ! : The sound ukulele great . It 's tinny like lot cheap instruments . After week trouble staying tune rarely needs adjustments . It 's lightweight ( good ) I n't think would survive fall . It 's magnet , 's gripe I . I plan sticker'ing anyway : ) The gig bag , said , basically dust jacket . I 'm cool says majority money I spent ukulele really ukulele , extras ! For price , ukulele serves purpose . I worried I 'd regret shelling another $ 20 $ 30 frequently recommended ukelele , I n't regret all.It 's pretty easy learn , especially bit musical knowledge experience . Even n't , n't take long playing songs ! You gift internet information everywhere ! This ukelele perfect beginner someone wants cheap backup travel option . Plus , 's costly choose upgrade , n't lost whole lot money.This would also great kids want learn instrument . My little brother get ukulele since I got one ! That 's ! I update problems arise time.Do n't hesitate . If 're new , n't worry spending $ 50+ something else ( I mean , want , go ahead ! ) . This : Apparently , thing $ 20-30 . I $ I got . If 's $ 30 , wait days see goes . I mean , 's worth money save little spent extra $ 5 new pack strings , would even better . ( I give 4 stars 5 simply I played ukuleles , I certain ARE better . That 's . The $ spend , better . But definitely pretty solid much costs ! ) I acoustic guitar experience novice level , I also wanted learn Ukulele quite time . As I never much touched ukulele buying one , I looked low-cost soprano see whether I would enjoy playing similar looking different sounding smaller receiving item , I tuned little play using basic chords I learned . The Uke sounded acceptable , I ( slightly ) disappointed sound default supplied strings . Also first ( I expected ) , Ukelele went badly tune quickly playing , hours strings broke keep tuning occasional minor tweaks required.Of course , cheap ukuleles come fairly terrible ( cheap ) strings would wrong critical instrument cost little . I ordered Aquila strings Amazon replace default strings - i.e . I bought theAquila AQ-S Nylgut Soprano Ukulele Strings . I still waiting delivery , update review I eventually fit difference makes , ( I expect significant improvement sound based upon research . ) To honest though , default strings ukulele n't bad I may wait install strings I play get benefit ! As far design quality ukulele goes , I pleasantly surprised impressed . The blemish free well done , unit appears assembled well using adequate components , tuner backs reverse headstock decorative little gold , nice touch . The unit definitely belies price nice looking money costs , difficult voice serious gripes ukulele . I 'm much looking forward getting competent instrument coming months . I really could n't imagine giving ukulele anything less full five stars - 's great . This great little ukulele around house . I originally ordered different one got one error , Musician 's Friend showed exceptional customer service refunded entire amount purchase ( included change set strings ) , told keep ! I floored ! Back ukulele-At first I thought cheap enough knock around abuse , I found actually liking one ! The action fine , change strings , sounds pleasant . I used D'Addario J53 black nylon strings . The tuning bit , easily compensated . It 's fun strum well worth $ 20 ! Great starter Uke . got wife loves . Stays tune . good sound.The price right . The U-30 decent starter 's ukulele , matter color get , without flaws . The tuners feel cheap , functional , much better friction tuners `` toy '' ukuleles . The body paint good quality resists scratches ease , paint fretboard comes easily unto fingers . The string action low , making perfect fast strum patterns . Even soprano ukulele , one higher pitched sound little sustain , actually quite authentic `` Hawaiian '' sound , tiny sound low sustain make playing along instruments problematic , unless using microphone . The worst aspect ukulele strings , takes forever stretch `` break . '' This means must tune ukulele virtually every song , beginning ukulele players remember get chromatic tuner . Chords use first fret , F A sound distorted reason . Replacing included strings Aquila strings makes ukulele much better , added cost puts price range I would consider true starter 's ukulele , Lanikai LU-11 . The included gig bag almost useless , absolutely padding tight . In conclusion , low price distinctive high pitch `` Hawaiian '' sound make shortcomings . I would recommend ukulele , even starter , since problems first fret chords train ear wrong way . I would recommend U-30 backup `` disposable '' ukulele take anywhere , without fear damaging losing , little money , get better . This great little uke money ... I 've bought kids quite gifts ... As many noted , tuning stability improves strings stretch ... One suggestion - If 're willing add bucks purchase price , buy set D'Addario Aquila strings put right away ... The stock strings pretty poor , even set 4 dollar strings vast improvement . Other , I love little guys , plan keep buying ... Finally , buy ( uke ) favor watch movie `` Mighty Uke '' ... You wo n't stop smiling ... D'Addario Ukulele Strings , AQ-S Nylgut Soprano Ukulele Uke : The Amazing Musical I researched little bit . It gift child , child could n't tune thing could I ! It toy , instrument . My kids interested learning Uke . This one really appealed son front design . Plays well keeps tune . I recently ordered ukulele 4 others researching products senior adult choir church I wanted give options.Okina UK100 Soprano Ukulele Rosewood Fingerboard - NaturalDiamond Head DU-150 Ukulele , NaturalMahalo U-30OR Painted Economy Soprano Ukulele ( Orange ) Lanikai LU-11 Soprano UkuleleKala KA-15S Mahogany Soprano UkuleleThe Okina , Diamond Head Mahalo $ 30 time within $ 2 price . Of three , I thought Mahalo best offering visually terms tone quality . The Okina poor sound quality even compared 20- 40-year-old ukuleles ( original strings ) . A string upgrade Aquila strings helped significantly , even , Okina still far worse sound quality price level.The Diamond Head Mahalo sounded better even stock strings includes nice ( price ) little gig bag . Incidentally , Mahalo product description says `` brown gigbag '' ended black , black pretty standard gig bag color . The Mahalo `` island '' look eyes best sound . Much sound probably attributed strings substantial Diamond Head 's . That said , still makes financial practical sense get Mahalo since 's near price ( compared Diamond Head ) better strings already installed . I 've also reviewed Lanikai Kala pages . I guess I expect much , since cheap . Just know get pay buy . I got son , n't impressed . Does good sound , hey ... 're wanting toy , go . high quality , cut dolphin tuners , described , works like , good begginers I doubt beat $ 25 ! The uke solid little guy . I shimmed bridge little I play hard , n't bad . Pretty well tune neck . Strings ok I Aquilas put ; see matters much.The tuners ARE geared , friction like one picture -- - least , mine are.The carrying bag , padding protection , keeps rain . Bought bass playing step son , dont know uses I loved green , , I two , soprano tenor ( Larger ) cant play crap , liked look . I 'm ukulele player , I pretend one , I guy likes make music I happily say Mahalo perfect addition instrument collection . Worth noting need tune ukulele time play first weeks strings & # 34 ; broken & # 34 ; , I 've read gathered , par course . Lastly , 're going order one , I suggest pairing pack felt picks . Cheers ! 
316	Guitarists become bunch . There many players concerned name headstock guitar amp endless `` boutique '' pedals many seem unable unwilling give listen `` stock '' gear , anything n't cost arm fact 're gigging musician , I , come realize subtle , detailed nuances tone many want obsess get lost band mix , poor acoustics wherever 're playing . Yes , want sound good 's inspiring , frankly , I n't need $ 200+ dollar distortion/OD pedals n't owned DS-1 long time , recently got one I looking distortion pedal budget . Frankly , I 'd forgotten musical pedal . With distortion set minimum ( never gets clean ) 's good , overdrive still lets guitar 's basic tone get . I play strat & jazzmaster - guitars still sound like thing . With gain halfway get great crunch . And even gain maxed still get excellent note definition chords . What could want ? Sure , 's `` old school '' rock distortion . The usual `` may appeal metalheads '' caveat applies , maybe . Combine eq could scoop mids much want.I also Barber LTD ( great , relatively cheap `` boutique '' moderate gain OD n't break bank ) Visual Sound 66 , tubescreamer clone ( much gain ) compressor one pedal . Both LTD & 66 usual TS9 midrange hump , though much less pronounced What 's refreshing DS-1 strong mids , overall tone realm tubescreamer , sit well pedalboard bring different flavor party . The tone DS-1 get bright , I indicated I play single coils , I problem finding sweet spots tone knob - I generally run around pedal steal - look around find used one good price . I 'd considered modtone , decided go generally bulletproof Boss instead , basically price . I could n't happier . Think artist 's tool . And every job ' tool . Is best distortion pedal ? That really depends sound trying get using . If using bad gear poor technique perform miracles . It make 15 watt solid state Ibanez amp sound like raging Orange make single coils sound like EMG . But arguing pedal ' like two painters arguing color best used paint sunrise . This pedal good tight kind heavy modern metal running clean amp - makes sense . It n't make sense , ample Youtube reviews check pulling trigger . It used professional players like Steve Vai , Joe Satriani , Kurt Cobain . It professional pedal used professional musicians . It 's built like brick durable get-out . I found mine used $ 20 , new asking price fair . I would like see Boss start using true bypass instead buffered bypass use , admittedly I n't detect tonesuck . I 've run mine tube amp verge breakup really get things cooking . It also takes overdrive sustainer pretty well bump gain get singing leads . With exception ' type pedals companies like Tech 21 , I think included- perform run solid state amp . So happy way distorting Marshall MG , problem amp . I pedal 15 years , replaced old one month ago . It distorts sound , quite way would imagine though . This effect sounds really good fat cab larger amp let cabinet give tone little color . I use Epiphone Valve Jr Marshall 2x12 stack top fine . This thing Champ smaller amp give meat probably looking without EQ pedal.This says . One Volume knob , one tone , one distortion knob . IT . This pedal must pedal board . I love overdriven sound pedal distortion element distorted single notes lost fray . odd years counting still one best . This first pedal I ever bought I started playing guitar 15 years ago . It 's still primary set ! The sound puts balanced : get subtle sound , high-gain hard rock/80 's metal sound . For looking insane crunch , n't . Anyone wants nice , versatile pedal , IS one want ! This cheap piece junk says , distorts , You want something make guitar sound like junk , . Why pedals make guitar sound like piece junk popular beyond . This boutique Distortion pedal like Hendrix would use . distortion things built heavy metal , last , I kinda hope n't ( kidding ) , want distortion , got distortion This distortion pedal . It give amp boost solos turn clean amp dirty girl . It 's pretty harsh tone - kind white noise distortion . The DS-1 DOES NOT warm tone amp . You dial tone , 's pretty harsh sounding.That said - DS-1 exactly I wanted . My amp gives nice warm crunch , classic rock style . The DS-1 gives 80 's metal punk rock sound I wanted , took 5 minutes tinkering get nice transition amp matching tone DS-1 . It 's BOSS , last drawback 's item currently cheaper elsewhere . Usually Amazon sort thing , word wise , n't pay $ 40 new thing . I find I play pedal along Boss Super Chorus pedal , guitar Tex-Mex pickups captures lot Gilmour 's sound tonality . This pedal market long time smoking deal Boss pedal $ 40 . The pedal works great almost guitar pickup set sings EMG powered Schecter tube distortion levels dialed surprise , works good bass although bass players know lose bottom end.The guitar universe always raves Boss distortion pedals guitar player one distortion pedals . Buy experiment gain settings find favorite tone.I may buy another one mod use bass . From review , entitled `` For tone snobs , '' review product 's page : '' Alright , want get good ( somewhat `` basic '' ) distortion sound less $ 100 ? This deal . `` I strongly disagree . You find MUCH BETTER distortions $ 100 less , even near $ 40 mark DS-1 currently priced 've played guitar 10 years . Like many people one first pedal purchases DS-1 . , everyone talks , 're available given music store nation , hear famous musicians using , plus DS-1 actually pretty cheap ! So I snapped one like everyone else . Come find something , n't always mean GOOD ( see : Nickelback , movie , family , etc ... ) .So I plugged n't really care . The distortion harsh , thin , artificial sounding always noisy . I tried amps ( My practic amp : solid state Fender Frontman 25R , big amp , , 100w tube halfstack ) It diverse , basic sound . I 've read Japanese made DS-1 's better sound newer , made Taiwan models , either way , DS-1 great pedal , like many newer players , I n't know better time . Fast forward years I 've bought sold literally dozens pedals . There whole world great tones found keep eyes pedals I currently I like much better DS-1 . All great general purpose distortions , easy enough find new used guitar shops , , time writing , bought brand new $ 75 less good ol ' Amazon.com , rugged enough last years : Boss DS-2 Turbo Distortion : Lest I catch flames people thinking I 'm Boss ( I 'm certainly , I loved TU-3 , , MD-2 , , among others ) I 'll start DS-1 's big brother . This pedal much nicer tone , mention 2 distinct distortion modes . The I setting pretty much higher quality DS-1 , II setting brighter , richer tone . As DS-1 completely DS-2 popularity , find DS-2 's ebay cheap prices . A worthy pedal , unfortunately overlooked Co : Great dirty distortion pedal . Probably personal favorite . You 've heard box used literally hundreds thousands songs last 30 years , used ridiculous amount guitarists . Its rich , full distortion higher gains gets slightly fuzzy . I 've never heard bad tone mine . Its great getting `` big amp '' kind sound small practice amp . Its also great pushing big amp much headroom overdriven sweet spot without crank amp volume . A truly excellent Little Big Muff : The Big Muff another pedal 've heard hundreds songs . Its kind fuzz , kind distortion , definitely owns sonic territory . Very big , saturated warm . Used heavily 70 's classic rock tones , also 90 's beyond tons grunge garage . Used everyone Carlos Santana David Gilmour Smashing Pumpkins , Jr. Jack White . I personally reccomend Little Big Muff , touch tone recent NYC reissue , smaller , uses regular 9v adapter CHEAPER ! A great Distortion + : The Distortion + great first distortion , usually found pretty cheap . Whats nice Distortion + sounds great anything , lack tone knob helps keep somewhat transparent , i.e . easily hear natural tone guitar amp , n't cover sound . Used quite famous folks , including Garcia , Randy Rhoads ( Ozzy 's famous guitarist ) Steve Jones CM-1 Cool Cat Metal : Make sure get Cool Cat Metal , NOT Metal II . That 's fine pedal well , definitely traditional metal pedal . The Cool Cat Metal , CM-1 , actually different pedal metal pedals . Basically , pre-amp sits floor . It fully adjustable EQ tons volume gain roof . So anything clean boost ( gain minimum virtually NO coloration tone ) high gain metal stuff , plenty great overdrive rock tones . It works well amp I 've tried , find tons great sounds . Its unbelievably versatile pedal , even true bypass . The best part , Danelectro seems made way many , easily find one used even new $ 30 . A true hidden gem 's actually CHEAPER JF-03 Crunch Distortion : This little guy surprised . Its supposedly clone MI Audio Crunch Box , , , must one awesome pedal . Its essentially Marshall stack box , boy ever succeed . Great crunch , tons volume gain , really make practice amp sound like big ragin ' stack ! It even sounded good going modeling amp ( pedals work well modeling amp , one even sounded better Marshall simualtion built ) , get brand new one $ 40 shipped , fantastic ! Speaking Joyo , I 've pedals well one two MOEN , another Chinese pedal maker , I 'm honestly floored nice sound given shockingly low price tag ( especially theMOEN Fuzz honestly Big Muffs every Big Muff I 've ever played ) . So JOYO MOEN , make variety great sounding fuzz , od , dirt pedals , check ( anyone gets arms supporting Chinese company , please keep mind NONE pedals listed review , DS-1 included , made America , let alone western ) suggestions give something look . Also , ca n't actually try pedal store , YouTube great place hear demos different pedals do.I also mention try love DS-1 suits needs , power . Tone subjective , every pedal sounds different running different guitars amps , I may share different opinions something love , 's okay . My main reason posting lengthy review give newer players information . You PLENTY options distortion pedals , DS-1 NOT thing 's affordable . Find something truly love buy . If DS-1 , one pedals I 've mentioned , anything else , important part sounds right YOU . Here 's deal pedal . It inexpensive get better pedal barely bit money sometimes little less money . In opinion , spending less $ 100 distortion pedal , whether first pedal pedal , bucks get MXR Badass distortion much crisper tone . This little expensive brands , think sounds great 's way durable plastic pedal.I 'm pretty new electric guitar 'm really distortion tone expert like reviewers . To sounds better easier adjust modeling amp , I think 's good purchase . This best deal ever first pedal zoom really electronic synthesized sounding alot echos stuff . Honestly best effect held pipe effect . I got today man sounds crisp clean evenly distorted . It job distortion sustain best buy best price ! ! ! ! ! ! ! This pedal around long time , though overall quality Boss cut corners enable lower priced mass production pedals , boss ds-1 remains staple image distortion stompbox 's . The ds-1 no-frills tank pedal ; designed withstand direct nuclear blast well Michael Moore stepping , know take amount punishment might care give it.This pedal n't replicate type 's `` Marshall-in-a-box , mesa boogie , vox , Fender ; tonal aspect n't complex dynamic . It add plenty grind tone , plenty hum go . If 're looking first distortion pedal use 15-watt practice amp , look . If decent tube amp , look elsewhere , pedal , get pay , simply quality amp : Inexpensive , good build quality , distorts signal.Cons : Lots hum , tone control gets really shrill really excessive hum tone control , would get 4 stars . I love pedals . Inexpensive purchase - easy mod pedal received gain JCM purchase mod every one them.This pedal also good stock lead boost . Love pedal . There 's element nostalgia DS-1 I 've never understood . I know 're cheap . I know 're incredibly durable ( BOSS pedals ) . I know everybody one tried one point , Kurt Cobain ( apparently ) used I also know I 've almost never happy tone I get I step pedal . It 's incredibly thin harsh , lacks proper sustain , even cranked way . I 've used Marshall solid state amps Vox tube amps . Fender single coil pickups guitars humbuckers . You mess TONE dials want , dozens affordable pedals , even distortion , richer , deeper tone.Coincidentally , I also used BOSS many years , supposedly DS-1 OD-1 . That pedal n't ideal either , I turn knob way `` distortion '' , 's much better tone I ever got , dependable usually $ 40 ( less ) , I ca n't really give bad review probably belong everyone 's collection . That n't mean 'll want use time . ... 's distortion really useful much beyond lead boost already distorted amp . The true many pedals era , including ( ! ) Tube Screamer . The Tube Screamer great lead boost already distorted amp , many people tell 's great stand-alone distortion 's . Same goes Boss DS-1 . Now , 's things get interesting : There PLENTY modifications done pedal Keely , Monte Allums , others , turn otherwise mediocre pedal raging beast , dripping tone gain sings weeks . For cost pedal , $ 30 costs get materials mod , well worth . Mine modified Monte Allums Rectifier modification 's absolutely killer . I use lead boost , 's nice overdriven tone 'll find plenty use . If want basic , solid , well-built distortion pedal , - Boss DS-1 really nothing special . But platform great-sounding mods , ca n't go wrong . I know , I know , many people hate pedal , calling & # 34 ; stale & # 34 ; , & # 34 ; generic & # 34 ; . The problem simply n't found right settings pedal amp , , , settings amp , pedal make difference . One thing note bit quiet side opinion . I Digitech Bad Monkey , I set level 2 matches amp . With pedal , I crank level make clean tone level distorted tone . This excellent distortion pedal people want traditional rock sound . I use Fender Mustang amp Ibanez guitar good humbucking pickups . It 's easy use rugged . If play metal , might want get HardWire TL-2 instead ; pedal delivers distortion ( insane amount , necessary ) tone control , 's also expensive . But easily boost distortion achieved DS-1 using amp overdriven setting . The DS-1 excellent general purpose distortion pedal . I n't know achieves level quality price-range . First I expert things I tell brief period I owned DS-1 I enjoyed playing/practicing lot pedal . I Fender wannabe guitar , Fender 10 means gear n't best pedal produces wide variety distortion tone changes keeps interested . I much fun I n't even notice fingers hurt anymore . Honestly , essential buy starting along headphones cord extension police n't come . ( update 2012 ) It year later I much better guitar amp lot knowledge . I glad I got DS-1 reasons . Sure made enjoy playing practicing lot I soon found sound considering I like blue classic rock . Again money I dont think beat importantly buck send modification Keeley . Initially I wished I went overdrive ( OCD Boss OD-3 ) mod done Keeley I super flexible pedal cover sounds I need . In closing , spend $ 40 buck get ... .and start wishing could send modified thank later . 
317	I 've buying gear Alto Music since 1980 . I 've trusted guitars , 've helped make right decisions needs budget . Last year , I bought set Fender Custom Shop Texas directly Alto 's web site . Over past year , I received bunch Amazon gift wanted get Shure SM7b . When I saw I could get mic Alto Music , brainer . I purchasing local music store Amazon . As mic , 's SM7b , 's everything I looking , despite low output mic . It 's smooth , sexy low end color , harshness , , high frequency unpleasantness occur condensers . I 'm recording untreated basement , mic perfect I 'm singing loud rock stuff ; picks 's right front none room . I 'm using Focusrite 2i2 , great loud singing , I 'm picking clean quiet gain use mic acoustic guitars softer vocals well . For mic 's cracked . I use Shure SM7B mainly podcasting voice work performs extremely well applications . I also use PR-40 Dynamic Studio Recording check link review item . Both microphones dynamic microphones give voice warm , natural thing , well actually two things , Shure SM7B Heil PR40 set two switches . One bass rolloff one mid-range emphasis / presence boost . While switches useful , I prefer keep mic flat let outboard processing / EQ handle adjustments need done . If n't outboard processing , could helpful bass rolloff really help keep low frequency noises ( example , someone bumping table ) minimum presence boost help certain voice ranges cut mix bit I reviewed Heil PR-40 I said best bang buck Shure SM7B may changing mind bit . While PR40 $ 70.00 cheaper SM7B Amazon time review considerations must made fact PR-40 users want use shockmount ( $ 100 ) pop filter / windscreen ( $ 15 - $ 60 ) get best results microphone . With SM7B shockmount built microphone surprisingly good job Shure includes two different foam windscreens ( one normal use one ultra-close use ) microphone . So bottom line Shure SM7B accessories probably going less thing worth mentioning like Heil PR-40 Shure SM7B built like tank . It heavy microphone opinion looks cool whether mounted boom desk stand . Both microphones perform far rejecting sounds excellent microphones voice podcasting SM7B takes little drive Heil PR-40 , 'll want make sure decent mixer / pre-amp handle microphone.The bottom line Shure SM7B high quality microphone I would highly recommend . If 're comparing Heil PR-40 likely thing make difference aesthetic differences price performance two , close . You looking I consider best friend voice ever . During 40 year broadcast voiceover career I used ( forced use ) every large diaphragm studio mic planet along Shure SM7B 's predecessors SM7 diaphragm dynamics notable advantages condenser microphones voiceover work solo vocalists multi-track studio work . I 've used years Sennheiser , EV RE20 , EV RE27N/D , Shure SM7B , Shure SM7 , Shure SM5 recently tried Heil PR-40 . Sometimes selection , I used available . Of lot Shure SM7B favorite ones still available . The SM7B better shielded SM7 SM7B today better shock mount old SM7 earlier SM7B . The shielding B model minimizes RFI computer monitors , florescent lighting , radio transmitter proximity , etc . The SM7 redesign SM5 . I consider SM5 best vocal dynamic microphone ever created n't production ages . I used ribbon microphones also pretty good RCA RCA 44 good SM5 SM7 's SM7B best vocal microphone still production . Stop looking buy one . You find better microphone voice work whether singing spoken word . It controllable proximity effect , something missing EV 's . I play SM7B like violin , others I n't seem nearly much proximity effect toy dramatic good condensers voice work SM7B everything bad condensers voice work 's change jobs lot I got tired finding EV RE20 & RE27N/D mics Sennheiser everywhere I went , I bought SM7B . I never liked EV 's Sennheiser much n't ever feel like much tool . The Heil PR-40 pretty good n't on-board EQ options . For recording EQ probably big deal tweak post production live radio ca n't much that.The SM7B tool skilled vocal talent , trying make novice sound good might better RE27N/D someone actually knows really work microphone SM7B dynamic large diaphragm mic I know deliver everything real voice artist give . The reason microphone designed one thing , voice work . The others versatile , SM7B `` THE VOICE '' microphone intended . It however found secondary duty bass cab microphone pretty good recording loud boomy sound effects , primarily vocal instruments ever recorded broadcast , human voice complex difficult capture reliably . That one reason vocals sound good $ tube condenser microphone , since capture , overtones human voice . Unfortunately even best condensers also pick lots things n't intend also least trace self generated noise . If dry voiceover ca n't hide hiss condenser something else . With SM7B n't to.Even singing microphone sort secret weapon kids calling `` Recording '' today usually totally ignorant . They figure anything short multi-thousand dollar tube condenser microphone inferior studio vocals microphone proves wrong.If want good around microphone , NOT . If want best dynamic vocal microphone , . As others mentioned output needs decent preamp works pro studio gear I 've ever connected . I think cheap USB interface want put another preamp front make far usable recording whispers . Most real studio preamps good match . I 've plugged real junky mixers work . You need least 60 dB gain , spec sheet actually says 59 . 70 dB would better . Lots made `` LOW '' dB n't much less Shure SM58 dB ! dB n't much decent mic preamp . But `` '' USB interfaces built-in mic preamps probably going need help designed hotter output condenser Shure SM7B comes built shock mount stand mounting yoke attachments . Every large diaphragm dynamic shock mount made costs extra . They need external windscreen SM7B comes one ! I got mine 10 years ago still came two windscreens . It nice metal case storage/travel . I think come one windscreen bigger one Shure calls still come metal case . I use smaller windscreen mostly Shure calls RK345 still carry . The smaller windscreen makes microphone open airy I 'd suggest getting one RK345 's , accessory 'll need add . The windscreens held little Velcro tabs easily . They also durable foam screens.On back end tube round plate remove hex key plate multiple EQ adjustments Boost settings fiddle get sound like best . You leave plate want . This easily EQ flexibility large diaphragm I 'm adding two cents worth others pretty much agree thing rules voice work . I written review earlier wanted try new Heil PR-40 first make sure I still SM7B guy took Heil tryout happen since I n't want actually buy one . I still SM7B guy . I would give 4.5 stars wo n't let , since nothing better right class I rounded 5 stars , SM5 actually bit closer 5 star vocal mic . So I big fan SM57 Microphone vocal mic due ease recording good sound quality.I bunch Large Style Condenser Microphones ( Rode NT1-A , AT2020 , SP C-1 ) clear , sensitive 's difficult get solid performance mix without either clipping picking everything room . So 're like let go bit sing , try Dynamic Mic wide range belt A / B test SM7B I bought SM57 ( I love ) vocals - exact processing chain , cable , settings , etc . switched mics . I sung passage well , I say - SM57 sounds muddy comparison SM7B . If I n't new microphone I would still like SM57 , bottle ... going back . The SM7B clear sounds sweet comparison still handles vocal sound dynamics well.DYNAMIC SINGERS ( Rock , Jazz , , ) = If budget get SM7B n't , buy SM57 SINGERS ( ACOUSTIC , ) = If sing softly time really n't need one dynamic mics , would better standard Large Condenser mics listed . Of type , I like Studio Projects C-1 Best I think , close . I ca n't underscore endorsement mic previous reviewer ( ) . If n't started business , trying every trendy dynamic condenser mic hundred dollar range , might actually save bucks cutting directly chase going one . I 've always wondered I ca n't reproduce sounds local NPR outlet , I finally realize 's Shure SM7B I enhances voice depth richness filters pops unwanted ( face , separate pop filters cumbersome use ) . It 's directional `` selective '' ( rejecting room ambience background noise ) , 's perhaps ideal mic applications . But announcing , broadcasting , vocal performance vocal recording , I n't see anything could possibly equal let alone surpass . What need know ) This mic directional . You must keep mouth sweet spot times best results . back inch gets tinny muddy territory , inch close makes strong proximity effect . I found palm 's width tip mic works best . As long I keep mouth , results predictable good regardless room I 'm . Also mic aimed low face ( like lower lip chin ) 'll sound like stuffy nose . high ( like bridge nose ) sounds sneering nasal . Right upper lip works well me.2 ) The bass cut presence boost convenient . Use plastic thing like guitar pick switch , metal scratch . I 've played around switches end set flat best . Initially I thought presence boost good idea , mix made vocals honky upper mids . Flat 's 's . Flat sounds ) Being dynamic , wo n't sound open airy condenser might . Though takes EQ well , EQ . If remove foam use pop filter , get highs , working I realized n't always sound right , seems unbalance highs 5k toward sibilance little much , might work . After using years , I learned starting bad mix bright blaring adding SM7B vocals causes mic appear dull muffled , really 's mix 's problem . Whereas I start vocal sound make clear natural , build mix around , mix turns natural sound 's bright dull ) Yes , rejects room sounds condenser , amazingly . It rejects 's behind side , front 's pretty sensitive . So 're singing room behind , pick . So n't think make sound like 're dead control room , unless actually one . Hang acoustic foam behind 're set . Being records twice dry condenser , takes reverb pretty well mix , meaning add reverb delay without vocals drop far away undefined ) So sound like ? The sound natural true voice . It truly vocal mic first foremost . That plus characteristic mic 's top selling points . It works fantastically death metal growls clean singing atop sparse/acoustic/clean backgrounds . It slight color mids ; I agree frequency response chart indicating slight scoop , slight boost , 's still natural sounding despite . The color tailored voice : reduce honky boxy mids , main vocal range . That 's one reason mic considered `` flattering '' vocals . It still body though , definitely thin sounding ) This thing heavy rugged . The capsule surrounded truncated metal screen enclosed sides . The screen like kind see behind microwave doors . What I like mic I throw inside bubble mailer wrap scarf storage worry crushing damaging , n't need big case like condensers especially tube mics . So 's actually compact practice quick set one mic adapter mounts . Even without adapter , convenient free rotating collar screw onto hold mic place screwing ) This mic needs 50 dB gain loud singing , quiet singing , whispering . Make sure preamp designed least clean gain . Some cheaper USB interfaces go . If interface lacks juice , worries , get 'll add nice clean gain 's phantom powered too.Overall , I would prefer condenser good room since allows move little without coloring sound , air compared one . But since room n't perfect , . The biggest pros 's natural sounding even reverb delay stands mix . It 's especially good spoken voice , designed , since unlike condenser SM7B good job picking many mouth clicks , mouth noises , background end , I get rid mics keep one vocals rest life , would SM7B . Mainly I know I conveniently use anywhere , anytime , get reliable good results.EDIT 2014 : Forgot say , listen mic shoot-outs net , often times tip SM7B positioned distance condenser . This problem SM7B 's diaphragm actually back inches . So condensers closer talent ( lack talent ) SM7B cases , causing latter sound , honky , un-detailed , thin due solely distance factors , thus characteristic mic color . In shoot-outs proper distance used , 'd surprised much SM7B sounds like good condenser . It really . Of course may missing air ( , less prone sibilance ) I said EQ , since mic takes EQ well . Seriously , shelf highs . Another thing I wanted add , gentle bump 2k region ( vocal definition ) mic , sound slightly honky strident blaring depending sources , EQ bit . And finally , Shure says mic flat response , 's true , color frequency response charts show . Yet , color gives larger life natural sound voice , sounds natural even though 's completely transparent honest .

320	I 've using One Spot power Gator small pedalboard 8 years . In time I 've done probably 200 gigs I 've never problem . Is super quiet ? No , pedals amps gain single coil pickups , noise . It 's fact life . I 've never found excessive . Turn volume guitar way 're playing.I would recommend anyone looking affordable solution powering pedalboard . What amazing product . capability worldwide use , powering eight pedals , cost effective , . If I bought eight adapters , would cost well $ 120 USD . Even price 's sold , build quality pro level . I 'd happy using well-traveled pedalboard . At price , could buy two three packs power huge usually run six seven pedals typical session . Not , 's nice know delivery smooth , without drops spikes power level . I crank 'em I want , go NUTS . I use power Big Muff Pi , mxr compresser , Ibanez Tube Screamer , Planet Waves tuner pedal . The pedal I wo n't power digitech whammy , expected I bought . It works great . I use 9-volt battery adapter power Big Muff even works perfect . I get extra hum 4 pedals takes one spot surge protector . Great little power source . I 'm sure I 'd use professional gigs , great home use . Like many guitar players , I effects pedals different brands I needed alternative nine volt batteries power . At one guitar forums I frequent I started thread powering TS9 Tube Screamer nine volt power supply , One Spot came back twice replies . Since time I acquired two pedals I really needed something . I looked powered pedal boards decent boards expensive bulky . I got creative , I ordered One Spot Combo Pack bought 2 '' wide industrial strength Velcro built board fits hard-shell brief case.So far good , two months band practices One Spot 9V DC adapter Multi Plug daisy chain cable I bought , little four pedal setup works beautifully . I 'm perfectly happy . The One Spot adapter well made cable ten feet long long enough reach stage power source .

This thing awesome . It n't take lot room tone options connections ... .and 's way cheaper power box If using two pedal effects standard equipment list With price 9volt batteries ca n't afford purchase rig . If need , 's enough wiring space pedals . But wiring thin enough able stuff crammed pedal board . A great feature disconnect plug gives ability disconnect wiring harness 9volt adapter The 9volt adaptor comes plenty wire pedals board convenient position . I nice pedal board guitar rig , enough power 13 pedals . This totally solved problem noise power issues . Very smart idea well thought anyone needing one stop solution DC distribution . A+ ! I 2 combo packs simply great ! I 15 pedals connected 2 Visual Sound 1 Spot units Pedaltrain Pro , wiring underneath . Looks pretty neat along George L 's cables almost invisible .

No added noise , signal loss , saves cost hassle constantly replacing 9V nice assortment adapters use brand pedal there.probably durable power supply available , price , cant beat . I bought pedal board needed power wires . Bought kit . It super . The Spot ' provides power needed , wiring right pedals I 've installed .

No noise issue , `` brown outs '' power supply could n't handle load . I still open leads pedals ... ( smile ) . My power strip space `` toys '' make weak playing sound better . I 'd read lot One Spot power system . I needed power overseas I ordered . It truly nice product amazingly quiet . I currently high end power bricks two larger pedal boards ... I may swamp one . Highly Recommend . Love . makes plugging lot stomp boxes easy . Quiet power supply , lots cables end caps adapters , 'd pay single power adapter . It 's nice dig half dozen power supplies set play . About thing missing would right angle adapters , I 'm sure find somewhere.good quality , cord extremely long dc power supply . Quite people complaining buzz . I 'm getting . I use old Arion Stage Tuner , Digitech Bad Monkey CM-2 Tube Overdrive , Dunlap Wah 90s , Boss NS-2 Noise Suppressor . I run Fender Deville 410 , runs Acoustic Neo bass cab extra first I thought noise suppressor . But even 's , I 'm getting absolutely buzz price AMAZING . To able effects powered one plug godsend . The cables VERY long , maybe long , 's possible . If 're even thinking buying , JUST BUY IT ALREADY ! ! ! ! Granted voodoo pedal power , another isolated power supply , provide clean , quiet daisy chain power 8 pedals , pretty dang great $ 150+ silent ? reliable ? Yes.Would I use stage studio ?

If 're super quiet signal chain snob , save extra $ 150 get voodoo labs . This nice way get rid wall warts batteries pedals . Easily powers 6 pedals adds noise signal path . Simple , effective , works advertised . The extra adapters nice touch . Get one , 'll happy . I love product . power many pedals low ratings . No need expensive large pedalboard power adapters . For modest rig , road use , I recommend product . great useful product well made quite , lots use view floor effects , works great , , noise , buy . This powering entire effects board 's great job ! It easily connects variety different pedals adapters included 's enough wire power everything without cluttering anything extra wires . The value excellent anyone budget tired full power strips cluttering setup . I 'd recommend musician uses multiple devices I bought power supply home use - I n't much gigging recording , primarily used practicing messing around . The product works well ; I 'm able power 5 pedals easily . The cords plenty long length , however bit difficult chain together longer pedals shorter ones without two pedals right next ( i.e . wah pedal next standard size pedal ) . However , minor complaint way effects usability product . I n't use special adapters though , I plan getting Line 6 , Line 6 adapter great added touch . Best , power needs pedals takes one outlet spot home . I 've using product months complaints . You ca n't beat price . This system works good . I use every gig , problems . The leads actually little long , 's good thing . This great keeping pedal board organized . All need power conditioner ready plug . Godlyke , I 'd say better purchase . Though Godlyke product claims power ( 2amps ) , slighlty less ( 1700mA ) . Anyway , drawing much juice using pedal board , may want re-consider using . The product plastic , seems solid , I believe hold repeated use problem . Being plastic though , careful drop stepped rolled , etc . I like fact heavier gauge wire Godlyke product seems slimmer fit readily ' 1 spot ' advertised . The heavier wire means someone rolls 4x12 cab power supply cable higher chance survival . The extender comes good , seems generic length space connections get . I wish came two . I using Pedaltrain Pro board inches , require pair extensions get pedals . The combo pack also includes adapters odd pedals refuse conform use 1/8 '' power connections , 9 volt adapters pedals external power . One thing I checked yet actual output supply . A lot companies think voltage 'close ' 9 volts , thats good enough . The reality indication poor quality control lack producing quality product . You find higher end devices specifically warn NOT use anything higher 9 volts 9.6 volts n't 'close enough ' . Anyway , I checked output adapter yet , I fire pedals I could power one extension came everything worked nice quiet . It amazing good quality power source help eliminate buzz ' signal chain . I 'd buy fact I may buy another back . It tad pricey thirty bucks ... feels like twenty five dollar item given plastic construction , , good buy competition . It 's good ideal big problem I Ya using tube Amp . ( 65 ' Twin Reverb Fender tube ) Ya get one . It 's bad I ca n't use . I 'm sure transistor Amp . uses ? ? ? ? Sometime round 1994 , friend built several band . They great incredibly handy . I havent , wondered later started seeing marketed developed first one . Certainly , , never patented , flash forward 18 years sitting row stompboxes , resenting batteries individual power supplies . I thought back first sound combo power supply realized needed invest one ... .and . This one comes slip covers unused adapters . So far , lived expectations . I cat speak playing yet , mostly messing around little home studio , definitely havent heard crackle recordings amping letting loose . So , simple device , really cant beat ... unless dont really use boxes . Personally , presently wah , distortion , chorus , overdrive , delay , slap echo , flanger running . Everything works ! A real money saver smart buy ! It works perfect Boss pedals ! I Happy ! This perfect . No buzzes , hums , nonsense . It 's simple use universal power supply pedals . Save hundreds dollars get . I 'm glad friend introduced product ! I new pedal effects , new pedal boards , new challenge power . I research settled Pedal Train board ( Mini , case ) One Spot power . This bundle -- including 8-pedal chain , adapters power supply -- . In fact , may overkill . I 5 pedals , I rest chain twist ties . And adapters , never used 'em . But complete kit . If need , I n't know tell ya . I dreamed something like around 1979 Guitar Player magazine plan build thing . It 9 volt battery MXR pedals 1979 , work setup . 9 volt power adapters modern kind , fit , . I got sorts stuff plugged ; mini amp , flanger ( AC ) , equalizer , compressor , fuzz , wah . Love gizmos . Say good bye batteries . This affordable , , given high number effects supply . I could find nothing better market price features . The One spot works nicely pedal board chain . Everything needed came combo , making ready go right box . I hooked 4 Pedals far 's awesome . Real cost saver batteries . You really cant go wrong price . This terrific product . While price might seem little high power adapter , actually serves function might need several adapters daisy chains key OneSpot 1700mA output . By comparison , Boss adapter puts . Since stompboxes draw 5 60 mA power , could reliably chain 3 4 BOSS combo kit great value comes daisy chain eight pedals , parts hookups 9V adapter jacks I n't use pedals . I use BOSS Ibanez pedals works great . Best , 's added electric `` buzzing '' noise , problem many budget power solutions.Also like cable hookups angled instead straight - makes much sense tight pedalboard . No 9V 's hooking multiple cables every time - one simple plug I 'm ready play ! What makes better kit need power 8 pedals . It comes various adapters even rubber caps cap power outlets arent using ! Powers pedals negative tip boss , maxon , ibanez , etc , etc . Even one reverse adapter oddball positive tip pedal ! Also connect battery pedal connecting battery clip ! ! ! One best features power plugs right angles n't stick straight pedals side jacks ... takes less room pedal board . Also 8 plugs stretch daisy chain cables.The great feature power capacity greater put 1700mA ... run 8 great item great price . No brainer solution anyone pedals . This I needed get rid three four large AC adapters . Great little kit anyone pedal floor board . It says , 's still great pedalboard solution . The distance plugs sometimes short . Also , 're using ALL plugs , 've got dangling end 've got try stash tie . Again 's good item inherent problems 're pedalboard varying distances pedals . Getting proper pedal power unit ( like Voodoo labs , DC brick , ) recommended . Even though lot outlets , pedal may receive enough power . I usually use power two three pedals time ok. Any , loss headroom pedals . May power pedals high current draw . Does says . I multiple pedals plugged handle . Much cheaper buying loads 9v batteries .

322	The strings nice feel them.Used replace factory strings recent guitar purchase.They improved action considerably . good stuff These great strings . I thought bullet end BS hype , I really think makes string stronger sound clearer . And even rusty ears lying , I say definitely fit better G & L Legacy guitars - regular strings little extra wind ball end coming right saddle cases - solve problem . I use strings Telecasters I say tone wonderful , beside last weeks without turning different color use . Very bright really convenient looks guitar . With twang twing twong nothing wrong ... got ta love strings wan na sing . I revising previous review 3250L 's ... I American Stratocaster two weeks . I loved much first I ordered 5 sets restrung several Strats mistake . Why I impatient ? These unbelievable right box , bring Strat life , giving unbelievable feel sound.But , every positive , 's usually negative ... .and wait ... ..wait ... yup , was.I changed pickguards two weeks installing Strat noticed three smaller strings . G , B & E ; flat fret side . They already worn . I suspected something sound changed already , becoming flat week.This NOT mu guitar , I 17 total rotate playing I bet I n't played Strat than6 hours so.Now , I 'm disappointed . I 'm going step 250 's , 150 I . I love sound n't want change strings every week.To make long story short , I would n't buy unfortunately search goes perfect set strings . These great strings favorite I found Fender Pure Nickel strings . Some may like sound may like Pure Nickel I 've Fender player since I first picked guitar . I 've used different strings Ernie Ball I always use Fender strings . For Stratocasters I always use Super Bullets Telecasters I use Super 250s . The difference two bullet end vs ball end 250s . The bullet end designed give better tuning stability tremolo Strat . I n't use tremolo much I n't know critical really since super bullets cost super 250s I figure I might well get ones designed Strat . Also , OEM strings Fender installs factory ca n't go wrong . I highly recommend . Having trouble usual strings I decided go back well known brand . These solid strings never let . They go tune stay tune . I wish little bit slinkier feel . Great strings ! Used years -- always loved . Put Eric Johnson strat . Would n't use anything low quality guitar . I buying string many years continue tips | & 20 words required./// I put instruments confidence sound expected time . Great strings great value strings really good tone tremolo stability greatly improves ! ! ! The heavy 32 , 42 52 adds BOOM tone . The others , 10 , 13 17 nicely decent tone also . I n't rate 5 stars lack VCI . When opened pack plastic anti corrosion protection . The high strings plenty flakes . If fender solved would perfect . These seem quite well constructed electric guitar strings I appreciate long . Rock On ! I issue new Squire Guitar , Fender hooked set . The String Ends Bullet end , rather typical small loop . The theory larger bullet end makes better contact tremolo cavity . I say sound great worth trying . I order I hand . perfect size Jazzmaster . Too bad seem get dirty quickly . Maybe hands sweaty These strings sound super awesome ! I 'm sure engineering specifics , looking responsive , easy fingers strings nice sustainability , puppies wo n't let . strings comfortable fingers sound pretty good bullet ends work well trem axe These strings I started year ago , tried different brands time frame . They hold IMO well better brands I 've tried , especially price . I probably change strings necessary I gravitated finding lowest price strings least decent quality . These fit requirement well . 
323	My daughter using strings many years work great . Excellent price product described price right . It recomended I get new strings I bought violin worked great . They steel coiled fine electric violin take time stretch bit hold tuning bit first . They 've great since . This string set offers typical D'Addario quality value . I use D'Addario strings guitars , mandos ancient old fiddle . I prefer 's premieres price . These ones little & # 34 ; bright & # 34 ; sound deep resonant enough . Also bear mind clearly far superior - would paying $ 50 set . D'Addario Prelude Violin String Set , 4/4 Scale , Medium Tension good deal beginners . It 's good enough , expensive . Try till ready expensive string . These good value quality strings.Strings stayed tune two hours settling in.I 'm satisfied . I would recommend D'Addario Prelude violin string set anyone want use wire-wound strings . They durable nice tone . , 're looking budget violin strings , probably n't playing principle violin New York Philharmonic . Me neither . I 'm violinist , I teach Mariachi Band elementary school students . On el cheapo violin , strings sound quite nice . I would give 5 stars , I think would bit . They 're fine . If 're looking 5 star strings , 're going pay ask someone plays better I review . awesome cheap repalcement string would recommend anyone doesnt want spend 50 bucks high quality strings

Gave guitar teacher , thought hoot . A pick pick , 's doubt , little art work sort gives personality . great picks 
326	Not great mic , need something realitively cheap , 'll . Limited dynamic range . But , works . Wish I 'd gotten something little nicer though . This second SM48 25 years ! What 's difference 58 48 ? The 48 made Mexico . There noticeable difference tone 48 on/off switch . ( I buy one ) If feedback issue practice space , get one switch , otherwise opt better say go ! ! Save $ 50 . This mic great ! I one I used coast coast coast coast . Unbeatable price quality . You ca n't go wrong brand name like shure . I mine 14 years still sounds like came box . You shame game arsenal . As veteran I recommend . It rocks ! As clean . I got mics I environment needed ON/OFF toggle microphone - us - works great . These mics sound great normal speaking singing small room . They sound similar Shure SM58 use every day . They still going strong . This microphone best microphone I ever owned . It dense , little quiet , sound absolutely brilliant quality . It clear sounding , well built . Get mic . You regret . I like durability , on/off switch . came carrying bag mic holder + adapter . powerful clear though would , far better mics price range used . n't tried PA live yet . bought Helicon voicetone im hoping boosts little . im sure mic years come hopefully spring better Shure later . 
327	I think amp size would sound good . Boy I surprized . This amp old Roland Cube 60 . THis amp LOUD ... VERY LOUD ! ! ! ! ! And tone adjustable great cleans nice heavy dirty sound . All super amp . The ZT Lunchbox sort new technology allows LOUD GOOD sounding tone come box literal size lunchbox ! I amazed small amp I first purchased - tiny . Then I amazed LOUD could still clean headroom . Others reviewed written hissing sound , I problem . After trying 3 guitars ( 1 passive p/u 's , 1 active p/u 's , 1 acoustic electric ) remains nice quiet . I using practice amp well band setting.Now 's thing ... NOT lot bass frequency , I noticed setting floor help , still enough 're looking heavy metal `` scooped '' sound . So , I would recommend metal heads ; however , rockers , tone knob makes big difference . I keep tone setting I prefer little darker sound enough mids cut mix nicely still.Bottom line ... I would recommend amp ( obviously I gave 5 stars ) . I n't think dissappointed . I purchased several amps last 7 months ( see reviews ) . I attempted move tube amps becuase I wanted set pedal board dial effects . And really , reading web pages eventually take tubes . I went Vox AC4 realized I n't want tube already defined limited sound ( fault amp - I experience ) . I also n't want modeler tube . I loved Orange Crush , totally unreliable.Enter ZT . . The amp limited gain available give traditional tube behavior . Nice break , reactive playing literally miles clean head room . But unlike tube amps - pedals come play I manipulate clean sound level without losing bit clarity depth . It also iPod jack , headphone jack ambiance ( i.e . make sound kind boxy ) . It model . Like Crush Roland Cube , 's voice . I 've heard Fender Tweed tone . I guess I see , still 's voice - important amp . I note - AC30 Fender Twin high end 1x12 Tube still louder much fuller . But 're talking $ 1000+ tube amps.I n't matching extension cabinet I n't need . It REALLY loud . I Mustang III gets destroyed ZT . At 75 % volume dial , I hit DS-1 actually make notes . That something Vox AC4 Fender Blues Junior without getting muddy . It fully . I n't played live yet , rehearsel environment , keeping loud drummer issue . A friend plugged Marshall 4x12 thunderous . Really , stupid powerful $ blues , jazz light rock , 's brilliant right box . It medal pedal board , check youtube videos Lunchbox played live setting metal band . It tube power 10 lbs solid state flexibility . I would also encourage anyone scour net reviews video . You simply find negative thing ZT Lunchbox anywhere . It really solid state aimed take prefessionals away bigger , heavier , expensive tubes . If play effect laden music , boy going hard time walking away drawback - $ 300 solid state amp really needs external pedals shine could turn - especially players looking swiss army knife amp . Roland , Fender , Line6 others still niche dialed . Well amp 's pros cons , however cons pros.Pros:1 ) Small ! ! ! ! 2 ) sounds like big combo amp 3 ) makes overdrive pedals sound better 4 ) sustain 5 ) big bottom bass 6 ) HD construction components . 7 ) I turn knobs way n't get noisy feedback . 8 ) soundsREALLY good ! ) yes , `` could '' louder 2 ) Not `` bright '' Now details , I tube combo amp comparison ZT bit dull side far presence.Its , could use . However made step distortion . Solos sing amp . I feel like guitar pickups stomp boxes sound better . The rig way . I stopped using combo amp together sounds good . I also kinda detect processed sound plugged straight I first turn ( seems go away ) . I know analog path digital modeling processing internally . It also seems positive release make notes sing get louder ring.Volume ? For conservative band small room fits bill . larger venues would work fine.If 're LOUD band , might consider plugging external cabinet option . ( darn I meant test review ) . youtube forums guys making amp louder plugging blank cord the1/8 '' aux input back . I tested yes , go louder whatever reason . ( I 'll getting blank 1/8 '' jack put aux port ) A small noticeable volume increase . If need LOUDER I suggest larger ZT , double price . A friend mine one longer uses mesa boogie marshall amps anymore . The 12 club ZT super turn knobs way n't get noisy I rate 98 % gear head satisfaction . Remember talking lunchbox 6.5 '' speakera tremendous feat technology get much sound little reviews youtube.PART II , extension cabinet option : Hooked 8 ohm cab sounded bigger louder . However NOT use internal speaker together extension cabinet - Turn switch . It WILL amp start acting weird . I found hard way , verified manual shut internal speaker . I would assume low volume could use . You 'll know touch back amp warm , I would recommend . I using ZT Lunchbox Amp year . wo n't confuse Marshall stack blackface Deluxe small , portable , solid state amp works advertised . People say loud n't kidding limits . The sound 6.5 '' speaker requires space develop . Up close painfully loud sound rather directional lacks bass . I use mine practice home band rehearsals . I played stage , mic 'd PA , n't happy sound switched tube amp 12 '' speaker.To sounds best humbuckers I 've played single coil guitars ( Fender Gibson ) usable results . If clean volume might disappointed . It gets loud distortion ( noise ) becomes annoying . Players use lot distortion ( e.g. , Metal ) get lot amp players need cleaner sounds volume . While ZT Lunchbox n't versatile small amps , great `` one trip '' load rehearsals.One thing consider adding matching ZT extension cabinet . It makes big difference two ways : two 6.5 '' speakers move air doubled speaker cone area helps thicken sound . Also , speakers angled separated area covered sound increased . This big help rehearsals . I point one cabinet towards room . I 've tried using guitar speaker cab , PA speaker , PA floor monitor extension speaker ZT extension cabinet sounds best . It 's size ZT Lunchbox thoughtfully put handle back stack them.For ultra-portable guitar ( harmonica ) amplifier get decently loud ZT Lunchbox hard beat . But particular tone might find lower wattage practice amp 12 '' speaker works better . This overpriced item . That complaint . There 's enough reviews state obvious . It small , sounds good , keep little jazz trio amazing . HOWEVER I say I 'm super uber pissed day I bought amp sam $ 450 dropped $ 250 . How amp come half price night ? I mean , kind scam company running afford stay business sell half price originally marked ? It 's like blue sunglasses . On TV They 're sold $ 80 . 6 months later get bin $ 2 CVS . This business , trying get much customers regard true value.. PS ambiance better feature newer verb processors.Edit : Just read another guy gives 5 stars `` used weapon knock someone . '' Not sure amp deserves 5 stars getting , certainly someone death alley . I stand logically opinions item . ZT sold $ 450 first place . It inadvertently turned customers like company name . I 've playing brother 's Lunchbox first plugged jam house I thought joking . This amp easily cut drums , even close confines practice studio . Granted , I heavy , messing around come classic rock early 60s amp three volume knob plenty tone good , exceptional . It 's clean Fender Jazz Chorus , 's still better many amps I 've listened . If want make spectacular tome machine plug FBM-1 Fender '59 Bassman quirks . The ambiance knob substitute reverb . It give sound increase , designed simulate open back amp true effect . The gain controls input signal amp , according manual like soft overdrive . The volume level solely controlled volume knob gain knob playing real role loud amp gets . Finally , speaker switch rear turning internal speaker , speaker circuit routing signal external cab . That means use ths amp head turning 6.5 inch internal speaker , active cab set external speakers addition internal phones headphone jack NOT turn internal speaker . You need speaker switch . Personally I love feature also use phones jack output PA amp 's internal speaker still definitely need follow instruction manual , especially advanced user 's guide , may initially disappointed . My brother returned first unit purchased pop turned , well slight hum idling . The replacement amp problems . However , follow manuals ( plural ) prevent problems . I mentioned quirks - power procedure positioning gain knob mid level keys smoothing amp out.Bottom line : tiny amp packs punch sound characteristics heard believe . If want true reverb need plug pedal ( check theBoss FRV-1 63 Fender Reverb n't already ) , small venues practice rooms ambiance feature probably need . Do take time read documentation start using amp properly used 's simply amazing . Let preface review saying I professional musician , I experience guitar amplifiers sound reinforcement equipment . I bought amp couple reasons- I wanted combo light weight , easy move , store , carry , also clean sounding slightly loud . I get sound level I want amp without turning volume knob 1/4 , I ever want , 's plenty headroom . It definitely clean , noise-free amp moderate sound levels , I add effects Line6 Pod Pro I want , like drive , reverb , etc.. As far durability goes , I 've day , I ca n't say . It year warranty period . Price Musiciansfriend good , I buy everything music ( Amazon ) . It 's solidly built . All , beautifully designed executed product . Thanks , ZT ! Update- So far , good ! I 've played amp couple weeks , 's great . Clean , low noise , I 'm used controls love sound . No need even use Pod Pro . I 'm thinking adding extension speaker cab design , using Eminence software Eminence Commonwealth 12 '' guitar speaker . Also considering Lunchbox extension cab . I n't really need volume 12 '' speaker might change sound enough I like , although I like sound 6.5 '' speaker comes . Always experimenting sound . To think people buy $ 2000 tube amps , wow I 'm kind expert ! Update- I hooked amp JBL PA cab , really rocked ! The JBL 15 '' woofer cab lot bass , I adjusted ZT tone give signal treble compensate . external speaker definitely way get volume desired . Now thinking Eminence 12 '' speaker 1 . ft. As extension speaker . 
328	I like bag , though slightly different bag pictured . It 's bit big tenor uke , 's probably made baritone uke.All good value money ! Had I known I getting I would never ordered . There gig bags gig bags . I 've ordered used inexpensive guitar gig bags . I expected . This one offers almost protection . The reason I returned yet return shipping leave little refund , may end returning fit Kala room spare . This second Makala gig bag . The first smaller size concert uke , second one I purchased Oscar Schmidt Tenor actually came . logo 'd gig bag included , I love uke bag . Single layer fabric providing protection . After comparing bag one Makala uke , I came straight page ordered another Makala I like bag better ? Its multiple layers provide padding protection uke inside . You carry around , set , let roll around back seat car ( little ) without blemish instrument . As good hard case ? Of course . But good bag.I also like fact 's logo outside . I buy decent bag put whatever uke I want inside . That disappointment another reviewer , 's plus.What n't I like ? The dorky pad around handle . Both concert & tenor bags handle pad first project remove . It 's uke inside weighs much need special pad handle ! And looks better without . The construction , fabric , color padding . This super bag ! My precious uku always protected look good . I bought impression soprano gig bag . I know says tenor ( I look ) since I put soprano gig bag amazon search I figured I would getting soprano bags ... Anyway n't seem much normal gig bag . Yes pocket extra strings . Not sure well holds tenor since I n't one . Mine black almost purple image shows ...

330	I 've ordered two kits aged white , one severe scratches scuffs tremolo cavity cover plate . Literally point looks like someone dropped concrete floor , accidentally stepped , decided good enough send sale . The knobs , covers tips great shape , however . Back plate `` greenish '' tint , single ply , 3-ply wasnt advertised , `` '' vintage cream . But I guess close enough considering price.Shipping took far long . ( Not sure Music123 USPS blame , Id go USPS ) Besides minor faults , items fit well look 2006 Strat look '57 , without huge price tag . If want breathe new life old guitar $ 20 , kit ! Changing pickguard hardware great way give guitar personality help stand pack . One favorite thigns Strats easy .

The product arrived description , I made mistake buy Fender Squier Bullet ( `` full '' Strat ) .There 2 differences pickup covers Fender Squier : First , magnet tips Squier closer together . I guess fretboard narrower Strats . Second , Squier 's dent bottom allow wires go side solution drill holes wider dent . Not beautiful thing worked.The parts ( knob , backplate tips ) fit perfectly . I like replacing pickguard plastic parts give guitars different look . It takes $ 40 ( accessory kit + pickguard ) give guitar make well spent . FYI - slightly white . . . unless 're comparing right next pure white pickguard , probably would think 're simply white . I happy made USA missing switch tip two cracked knobs . Might happen shipping switch tip n't done shipping . Recieved accessory kit , find I missing black tip switch tremolo bar tip . Trem back cover fit nicely knobs help complete project . Saving p/u covers next project , would nice get trem tip switch tip sent customer service . Received missing parts , immediately . Finished project . I definitely using seller .

331	good pedals perfectunder price excellent qualityI like sound 3 pedals pedalboard behringer product wow price u beat pedal , got pedal add second guitar harmony songs wow sounds awesome , probably note activate noticed kinda lower volume little bit , mind though still give 5 stars . It octave divider ( two ) It parallel intervals ( la Owner Of A ) It intelligent harmonies ( make sure guitar IN TUNE track playing ! ) It Digitech ( ) It chorus-like whammy bar 's 's welcome 's 're looking ( 's Lexicon , 's TC , profess ) know use really ca n't go wrong.Get one fun ! Because 's programmable I 'm getting another . I 'm second US600 pedal , first one broke . I plugged cheap cord input , I went pull , stuck . So ... I applied lot force pull cord . When I , I heard something break inside pedal , I went use , n't work.I pulled pedal apart inspected see repairs , ended opting buy new one instead . Even though pedal cheap housing ( worries little bit ) , Boss equivalent pedal 3 times much . So since n't `` staple '' effect pedal board , I 'm happy go something cheaper now.Pros : Cheap price- sounds : Cheap housing - may break used lot I 'd rather use solo-combo pedal save space , I find shopping separate pedals satisfy taste ! Behringer US600 Ultra Pedal pretty need little time learn , rock you.Just try . They said could hook volume pedal raise lower note 're playing three octaves , I could never get feature work properly.From video reviews I 've heard YouTube , even come close Boss version , costs $ 100 less . Since I professional musician I playing around , works fine . And ... get pay : I 've owned , discovered turn six-string Strat bass , turning balance knob way right , pitch second bottom position . In fact , I record Dean Edge bass onto Boss Loop Station record Strat top using Behringer Ultra Shifter/Harmonist , I tell difference tonality.I thinking selling bass . It become needless expense . Needs neck adjusted twice year , strings expensive , harder play Strat . Have n't got far thing yet I like . Same classic behringer plastic housing I personally never problems . Definitely get odd tone change work , I 'd say check YouTube channel hear , familiar tones . It dual tone shifter I looking . key capability . I n't seen much expensive ones features . A Great buy money . The Behringer US600 well-made . The high impact plastic housing hold well long abused . It sufficiently quiet modes seem color sound bypass purchased US600 specifically & # 34 ; Detune & # 34 ; effect . This effect works quite well single coil pickups going tube amps . The effect particularly dramatic Outputs A & B fed two different amps , giving nice room-filling stereo effect.I pleasantly surprised effects . The Pitch Shifter produces nice lower octave effect , good I heard anywhere . When using outputs , possible feed original signal guitar amp lower octave signal bass amp . This makes guitar sound HUGE ! The Harmonist effect amusing , limited uses . It wo n't make sound like Duane Allman playing harmony . However , handy short solos . I tried key G got useful results.The Trem Bar would work well loud uses like metal . The effect gives nice effect sound.Overall I think device offers value many expensive pedals . I seen several speak ill , I 'm sure took sufficient time learn use pedal . There quite learning curve gadget , results obtainable one takes time master device.One observation : This studio effect road effect . There many individual adjustments need made order calibrate effect . It would difficult box floor . I place top rig order access control knobs make adjustments . The way would work well floor pedal would device dedicated one effect ( Detune , example ) conclusion , I debated months whether purchase effect . I 'm glad I finally decided get . The great sounding Detune effect alone makes worth price . The Octave effect Pitch Shifter nice bonus . The effects icing cake . Kudos Behringer building another reasonably priced effect home studio enthusiast weekend warrior ! This affordable copy Boss Harmonist pedal . I bought mainly harmonist polyphonic pitch shift feature . But surprised much fun trem bar flutter mode play with.Anyway third day tracking pedal suddenly started one second delay . And fourth day addition tracking problem , hitting certain notes caused low pitch fluttering noise . Also pedal started times . I would given Behringer us600 five stars kept working , tracked nice n't tone suck bad . The Seller shipped fast I give 5 plus stars ; review regarding actual product.The US600 basic pitch shifter , n't expect elaborate plastic ; sturdy BOSS 9V batteries quickly , stock up.If use A/C adapter , get hum eliminator . ( 60 cycle ! ) Also run US600 AFTER distortion optimum wise shifting clean signal.Distortion , pitch shifter , chorus , out.This pedal gives sweet 12-string chorus sound alone worth 45 bones . The dive bombs , reverse dive bombs , flutter . Do n't expect 2 octave bottom , n't that.You sound like Thin dual guitar lead , get May , meets Allman Brothers harmonies budget , pedal n't true instructions , go YouTube watch demos . Super cool pedal tons applications . sounds great recording . would n't take tour anything , plastic . function buggy times . trem function works great . input expression pedal would recommend using one save pedal wear ... ... plastic . I love Behringer pedals , price get ton great sounding functioning pedals half price Boss counterparts . one favorite pedals time . I use US600 short lead riffs , works great sweetening role . It easy change key manually , point fact , much easier I originally thought . It 's pedal board .

333	Works advertised purpose . It front computer speaker set ( woofer ) use TV sound system.Works fine . I Behringer gear always works . I bought connect Audio Technica cartridge newer Onkyo receiver phono input . The unit work I turn volume 80 ( 100 ) get reasonable volume . In addition I Onkyo connected receiver I use zone 2 amplifier . With preamp I getting serious spikes amp . They audible lights would dim volume zone 2 speakers would drop . I problem source appears signal preamp.This unit may work perfectly fine Behringer mixer use n't meet needs . I returning . This well assembled packaged unit , designed price . So certain compromises single-supply wall wart - partly advantage get AC amplifier - basic circuit , inexpensive parts . The preamp supports moving magnet , provision load adjustments hand works well , packaged nicely , serves purpose folks audiophiles fussy , want basic amp turntable connect line inputs . Also , avoiding & ldquo ; all-in-one & rdquo ; tendency units include inexpensive D/A converters USB output , almost certainly cleaner uses suited.The unit also & ldquo ; & rdquo ; 'd like upgrade things like capacitors , resistors , . Or use nicer external power supply - first thing I 'd upgrade . Lastly , know ideal load cartridge , capacitance phono cables , adjust loading inputs budget limited . Behringer done . The Phono Preamp exactly looks like : It 's ultra-compact . It takes negligible amount space . It sit comfortably turntable another compactness , though , NOT sacrifice usability . It trouble amplifying turntable 's signal line level . Before buying preamp , amp could boost turntable listening ' level . The noise evident signal due far much amplification necessary . With help preamp , amp longer acts I comfortably listen music without amp 's ' I 'm turned 11 struggling ' noise.The build quality far superior anything else price point . It 's cheap plastic like many companies would try sell , entire enclosure fairly thick metal . This makes nice interference shield overall pleasing look . It also features ground terminal hook many turntables amps reduce , option buy black . accessible screws side , though , would small task take apart enclosure paint I wanted.This preamp also power switch , much issue . It 's one small complaint otherwise amazing product.Summary : If need preamp , buy one . It build quality performance much expensive preamps . I wanted wait till I got another phono preamp I wrote review . I get Phono really needed aux inputs cd etc . But right away I noticed first impression sounds overly bright . The next issue real problem might others . I using vintage turntable . The rca jacks work fine amps etc except little preamp . They tight make good contact I need mess . This problem gone new preamp . Overall good little unit may issues . If afford need inputs might want look else . It sound ok little bright . It supposed . I using Pre-amp year great . After I figured attach ground cable record player installed easily plug plays ! I noticed excess heat problems even though I keep inside closed entertainment stand .

335	First , let say , pictures I seen posted Pop Filter , put Yeti mic stand , clamp fit stand pictured . This design flaw , Pop Filter , Yeti stand , filter around long Yeti came . Blue , clever person , could easily fix , drilling holes side clamp mount . Then could move forward simply screw side mic mount screws stand . There many great pictures clever fixes , well . Since I mine hanging upside , boom stand attached Blue Radius Shock mount , issue , I say problem Blue fix . ( I written addendum bottom , great fix . ) Other brands filters give , problems . I going knock stars , I 'm reviewing filter , superb works meat . This studio grade , high quality product , metal , except two tightening knobs . The dual screen design eliminates plosives , P 's B 's example , better screen I used far . This especially true , screen distance inch Yeti capsule screen , 4 6 inches away unit , I found Yeti 's sweet spot Cardioid pattern . Next silk screened Blue logo also helps find sweet spot , place front capsule area . I like idea metal screen , especially transporting , wo n't worry snagging , runs , cloth filters . Speaking old cloth filters , I Neumann , 12 years old , nice screen well , cut pops well Blue , especially get closer mic screen . Also reading copy , maybe music , I see Blue filter , much better round 6 & 1/4 inch jobs Like Neumann . You neck filter position easily , cheaper filters I used past , creep back unwanted positions , Blue behaves . The Blue Pop absolutely transparent , muffling , foam filters , The curved design Blue Filter also protects sides plosives possible proximity errors poorly placed screen none . The screen solid build , Blue products I used far . It also fits look Yeti Radius Shock Mount like glove . Surprisingly , I paid little $ 30.00 Amazon , real bargain mind , high quality . This filter Blue Microphones way , I going use entire collection mics ! need use Yeti table top mic , especially using shock mount pop filter ( brand ) , I would suggest buying SAMD5 MD5 Desktop Mic Stand , works great set ! This pop filter built like tank compared cheap cloth plastic versions get discount music stores , 's bit expensive , quality functionality like night day . I use front Shure Beta 58A , 's absolutely perfect . Watch review one prior posts fitting properly Yeti microphone . Works like champ , gets rid unwanted noises ! Larger I expected . works exactly like ad says would , eliminates pops secondary noises background , easy install , nice looking It n't naturally fit onto Blue Yeti mic weird , since IS Blue mic supposedly universal whatever made work . For 10 dollars instead pop filter could one looks feels like 'll last time ! If pop filter fit right would gave 5 stars : x This beautiful shock mount . However price didnt perform . The mount doesnt fit directly blue yeti leaks wind plosive sounds P 's S 's . Not worth price .  It 's works . Nice small . Cool looking . Does job . sturdy enought . Might even get blue mic . I use 
336	I bought put really old Martin acoustic . The guitar still sounds amazing , strings certainly fit budget , provide great sound . These one best strings I 've used . I 'm blues guitarist take beating well . Very much worth cost I thank Amazon ! These good strings , good price . I purchased strings several times sound good last long time . These strings retain good feeling long time , well past point needing changed 've lost brightness . But seemed work well guitar I re-stringing . My son thought great knows quite bit . I bought ago got around using last week . I n't ever remember non wound strings bronze . To looks weird sound much better ancient strings . Brand name , good string , good tone , seem last awhile I change strings often never really know long set last . I used use Elixir Nano string , good sound , last . These . great sounding strings . I 've used strings acoustics even gave band mate . They seem keep tone long time n't change instrument tone like strings I 've tried . Like lot folks , I 'm picky strings , , good light string sound great acoustic . These strings great sounding , great looking fretboard , bronze . One issue I , 5th 6th strings big route tuning head , still wound nicely . I would actually say might want get Extra Light gauge , 's probably tuning machines , kind suck . 
337	I 've used three pop filters experiences home recording podcasting . This one worst . The plastic screw ( yes , plastic ) meant grip pole attach pop filter , completely supporting 's weight nearly angle . Bad ... , metal piece secures flex arm clamp . It seemed loose I got packaging flex arm would wobble rotate spot causing major problem came proper placement . After twisting twice I stripped . Now thing worthless . I 'm returning would rather go lady 's bag market sale crazy woman day continue put thing . Do huge favor buy Nady 6 '' pop filter . If n't , 'll wish . I use everyday . It prolonged life equipment improved quality vocal productions As stated 's bit heavy causes problems used stand boom , 's decent product fair price . Not easy set , hard tighten . Works well enough filter get placed . It 's good product , works well 's meant . I 'm glad I bought main pop filter , one bad reviews . Frankly , I 'd never heard `` pop filter '' popping p 's b 's came consciousness time device popped field view Amazon web page . I 'll bet couple layers women 's nylon stockings would effective , contraption pretty much purges offensive phonemes ( 're called `` plosives '' ) . I 'm still hearing `` '' phonemes ( sibilants ) along artifacts ( `` back '' vowels prefaced `` '' momentary effect ) , filter n't purport able anything price , seeing gooseneck , base , generous-sized screws , etc. , I 'm prepared say one fairly valued ( I doubt Shure Blue pop filters , almost double price , offer anything brand-name status ) . The hardware solid heavy-duty could wish . ( I know I 'll never able blow away . ) Unfortunately , clamp seems designed fit mic stand rather computer screen , almost thick . You may wat reconsider buying ANY model , top ( filter ) part essentially pantyhose wrapped around cardboard tube.Despite , clamp adjuster parts relatively honesty , Buy nicer filter , none . They NOT make huge difference recording quality unless 're using microphones . If case , spend money get nicer nice thing- keep artists getting close mic essentially making . I found quality nice dealing ... vocalists . 
338	Let start saying tuner previous tuner Korg CA-40 frankly , tuner terrible.The main differences SAT800 CA-40 : SAT800 build-in light , CA-40 not.CA-40 build-in stand back prop 45deg angle , SAT800 not.SAT800 auto manual mode , CA-40 auto.SAT800 displays octave note , e.g . 1E , 2E , etc , CA-40 displays displays alphabet , E oactaves.SAT800 numerical display cents , CA-40 made get new tuner finicky CA-40 using build-in mic . The needle graph jumps place harmonics guitar nothing sensitivity accuracy tuner . Yes , accurate many tuners poor usability . Another issue CA-40 poor screen . The screen dark viewable head on.The CA-40 flaws CA-40 even tuner : accuracy , usability , durability , versatility . What ask tuner price ? Over years , I 've literally owned dozens electronic tuners ... generally five six time various locations ... ranging $ 12 Musiciansfriend promotional item $ 200 rack mount . Most $ 30 range Sabine , Yamaha , Korg , Seiko . The Seiko time favorite , like Bear fairy tale , affordably splits difference `` small '' `` big '' . It stays put floor I run inline amp LCD display large enough legible I 'm standing . At time , neatly fits ukulele case . Beyond , simply good electronic tuners , accurately without . Bravo . I teach class guitar community college bought SAT800 loan students class . I selected rubber bumpers beefy build , expecting anything day age nail pitch quickly accurately . And , indeed , tunes acoustic classical guitars without . Oddly , one year use , nobody dropped bumpers also provide sure grip hand music stand . My prior smooth plastic Seiko cost four times much SAT800 managed hit deck several times week . Amazingly still works perfectly well suited students . However , display larger sported colored note names , intuitive beginner use.The built-in mic works fine quiet room useless classroom full guitars ( built-in tuner mics ) . You need use tuner pickup well ( I use Korg tuner pickup ) . If I nick pick I 'd say letter name pitch way small LCD . It 's tucked far right corner 12 point type positioned octave number . A lot students ca n't read notice small type . Also octave number immediately front letter many beginners assume string number ( n't matter many times I explain n't ) . Finally , easy accidentally recalibrate pitch . Nearly every week somebody inadvertently sets whatever causes bunch students tune . A lock button safety would smart design upgrade . Most nick picks n't apply pros advanced players something consider 're calibrate safety feature double pitch name size would 5 star product . Right 's mere 4.5 ! This first guitar tuner , I n't expiriance determine : tuner better tuners . Is working good , 100 % satisfaction . Rugged , good looking , efficient ... sorta like . Have several tuners different names quality . But Seiko certainly quickest . The rubber housing excellent idea . Would buy another .

340	Its useful . Looks really nice electric acoustic stand . durable well . Went shopping local music store guitar case , expensive . Went Amazon found great case , great price free stand . Great value . Works great . Easy assembly . Must fully expand base set guitar It arrived small package 3 main pieces ( base , bottom fork top fork ) n't take much assembly put together . It great job holding guitar upright makes look lot nicer well . I probably buy couple these.The downside I see far foam padding rather thin . I hope n't eventually hole wear , time I could see happening . I suppose time I could find replacement foam fix though . This stand made quality products . It cradles guitar perfectly angled right .

No modifications needed , even reviewers said slightest bump knock stand , I suspect none reviewers three legs COMPLETELY open therefore extended widest base . If n't really LOOK closely open legs , 'll think 've reached stop legs fully open . I n't fully open first , bit easy push , view , still acceptable . When I discovered I still open three legs bit , I retried much steady . That last 1/4 '' ( 6.3mm ) movement leg worth 100 % improvement . The stand fully steady I hoped possibly could , especially given price . , I gigged stand today problems .

Less expensive Guardian , holds Gibson Custom problem I would trust electric guitars basses .

The tubing made thin round steel tubing maybe .025 & # 34 ; wall , n't expect take much abuse snaps even welded better mine . Just folding legs repeatedly back forth likely cause break pop one light duty aluminum rivets literally thin metal tubing.For $ I expect perfection , 's foam covered needs never scratched stand one good quality- CHEAP ! Since less $ 11 , I see going hassle returning . I able carefully weld mine back together- would probably option . The stand might work fine n't fold regularly leave set up- If need portability I would definitely purchase better quality stand . I actually even dozen . I 've never issues marring finish acoustic guitars . They work great & ca n't beat price . I think I paid around $ 4.95 ones I purchased .

There n't much get excited guitar stand , however , 's job price right . I purchased four delivered time . Each adjusted , held , guitar securely . I found stand stable . The welds seem secure ad heavy enough job . My music teacher similar stand cost 4x much . It 's appear better quality . I 've used stand two years held great .

A good moderately priced guitar stand.I concerns foam rubber cushions affecting finish guitar result I replaced standard inexpensive vinyl tubing purchased local hardware store.A good moderately priced guitar stand . I would recommend purchasing . A inexpensive guitar stand easy assemble ( 1 minute ) holds well . Very pleased purchase . I use stand put acoustic guitar . A day n't go stand use . Just finished setting . Works perfect . , stable , even looks good . It 's holding Gibson Les Paul , trustworthy ! Great price . Wayne I little unsure I unpacking stand actual rack swings side side . When I put guitar , fine , held perfectly . This cradles guitar nicely . I wish like one picture straight . It actually reclines back fairly far . Well , father looks like would pics . I recommend anybody life ends needing guitar rack future . One best stands industry ! Fits guitar , banjo , even cello . Good construction easy put together.How beat ! I got 2 Electric guitars . They indeed work , stand legs decent . DO careful un-folding skin would easy . The guitar body cradle loose spins around real easy . The guitar fit well neck cradle works well . I problem foam cushion far ( I modern finishes guitars I n't think I put guitars gig bags stands bit disappointing . My Epiphone LP seems bit tippy stand Turser Strat knockoff , design guitar stands fault . I also like little rubber grommet include . All n't bad . Not quite good value money . Good little stand hold guitars . They function well inexpensive . The downsides bit light , best place near wall , case bump . Also , seems every one I ordered ( Here MF ) foam bit crushed simply could packaging manufacturer though . Do use ( foam matter ) Nitro finishes . Good product Great price . job fine . simple kind cheap looking hard balance rug ( even thick rug ... I thin rug still unbalanced , hey , really meant rugs I ca n't complain ) I two ( really wish I ordered time slight price increase self- ) I say - simply ca n't beat . I also Hercules ( 10x expensive one ) , two , got ta admit , major advantage tri-stand saving space ( actually huge consideration ) . I honestly n't know reviewers hard time balance two Musician 's Gear Tubular Guitar Stands I currently never given issue ( aside running INTO thing ) , hold variety : Guitars various styles , Banjos ( open back BG resonator ) , , anything long neck . All , unless specialized stand need , I would first come Musician 's Gear . It 's cheap , light , simple , job . Not sure else could want . I 'm happy n't know else add . It simply works . Bought two year ago , I 'm still happy . I like fairly light . It works expected given problems . I recommend item . 
341	I 've using abusing pedal effects since 1970 's . [ ... ] , running sorts things , chaining sorts configurations , many wart ' pedal years . I said b/c I n't want come . I 've learned single effective way power pedals properly infinite number 9v batteries , careful match pedal inputs correct adaptor outputs . Check polarity tip - tip positive negative ? You 'll fry Boss pedal flash plug hot positive tip one . Make sure polarity matches ( pedals want negative tip adaptors , except Digitech want 1/8 '' plugs ) . Make sure voltage matches . A adaptor 9v pedal wo n't power . things right save $ , Behringer pedals ( I use six board ... see product links ) `` polarity fragile '' , break right away wrong adaptor . I BBE delay way . Happy ! ! Behringer Slow Motion Effects PedalBehringer DD400 Guitar Delay Effect PedalBehringer CS400 Compressor Sustainer Ultimate Dynamics Effects PedalBehringer PB100 Preamplifier/Volume PH9 Classic 90 Phase US600 Ultra Shifter/Harmonist Ultimate Pitch Shifter / Harmonist Effects TWO Grunge Micro Dunlop M104 M104 Distortion Guitar Multi-Effects Processor Thought I would give pedal shot since inexpensive sounded really good online videos posted . Pros : Very good sound quality , many options echo suit every individual taste , bright blue & flashing red ( tap tempo ) LED 's , stereo - dual operation , tape + analog + digital types delay = awesome , guitar signal `` smooths '' engaged , class A bypass . Cons : Volume decrease hair engage pedal , signal becomes little ( sounds good ) analog echoes , batteries go FAST ( get adapter ) .All , worth money . Comes warranty , reason try . A lot options available good-sounding pedal . Great unit price . It offer lot variations echo delay types.It sturdy enough use stage piece . Even would use way . I ca n't say battery life use withan AC adapter . The EM600 sounds great using outputs 2 . I drive mine sometimes Behringer A/B box using one ofthe 2 pre-amp gain controls Behringer Tube Amp downside settings type control echo delay types read without getting close especially dim n't really big deal though often n't put EM600 Pros : I bought pedal primarily place volume pedal , swell pedal , function fairly well , lot cheaper . Aside , also nearly every type delay needed : *the tape/digital/analog switch slightly changes sound trails feature useful holding sound ( swell mode high repeats ) pedal & # 34 ; & # 34 ; playing notes time knob acts like analog knob , pitch shifting turned playing repeats knob go little one repeat self oscillation ( sometimes runaway ) depending delay type*the mix knob nearly cut dry signal*stereo input allows multiple instruments play pedal small problems , compensates inexpensive : The modulation kind adjustable width/depth one knob , n't best compared chorus pedal . Just general warbleThe blue led VERY bright , point ca n't see settings knobs , I cover sticker ( still shows enough haha ) *The casing plastic , thick durable enough ( maybe consistent gigging ) digital effect , footswitch state dependent , words , turn pedal , unplug , plug back , pedal turn buffered bypass , effect continue draw power battery cable plugged , even off*the battery difficult get press sides switch , lift up*there noticeable & # 34 ; click & # 34 ; change delay type ; however , led notes : almost half weight pedal bottom metal plate . The pedal without feels shockingly lightweight , good amount heft . For n't know , pedal copy expensive Line 6 Echo Park . The two things make better real deal lower price ( IMO ) better tap tempo . You odd sort clicking sequence Echo Park , Echo Machine simply hold footswitch 2 seconds , set tap tempo . When 're satisfied , hold enter regular on/off mode . folks point superior construction Echo Park , I wo n't totally . That said , effects modules construction Behringer pedals basically - plastic 'd like metal , surface mount construction ( practical maintenance really possible manufacturer ) . But , switch tone dock requires maintenance point - ca n't cleaned , dock becomes best I tell , settings copy original . That makes sense , saves Behringer costs R & D ; - make fit dimensions , alter tap tempo . That 's win customer decreases price . For find dilemma buying copy something else , I 'd submit pedal collection probably either partly wholly copied something else . Unless want restrict known originals prices , standard option . If worthy improvement ( IMO practical sense usually sonic one ) , would kind insist original . The tap tempo EM600 earns purchase , like lower noise floor Biyang X earns purchase copies - venerable MXR Dyna 4 stars ? Because 's street - cost cutting means pedal potentially something landfill years come . There 's denying , get 5 stars requires unsurpassed durability price point . Despite may think , done - ever slightly higher cost . Behringer probably decided preferred increased profit per unit instead , n't want go certain price point risk getting beat direct BIG reason knock star little amp crank get acceptable volumes , quite bit audible hiss pedal . If I used bigger amps , I would never noticed , would n't issue . But 21st century time lower playing volumes live settings , means smaller amps popular . So hiss could absolutely deal breaker . It might slightly lower P.A . 're using , I would n't sure . I 'd say 'd want ( true ) 30 watt amp ensure n't issue , may absolute overkill gigs really small ones . Overall , pedal works fine amp I 've tried , kind picky especially delay pedals . I 've typically found digital delay work better pedals opposed analog delay , pedal different - much I like MXR Carbon Copy BBE Two , n't nearly flexible . This one IMO par flexibility old Boss Danelectro Dan Echo . But surpasses different types delay effects . Many something I would never use , I could imagine others would absolutely love . Or - could come handy something specific , great flexibility recording studio.Also worth considering EM600 's price , could buy backup 2nd one different settings . I 've 4 days I 'm glad I bought . Its basically top end 2 second delay whistles bells would n't even think would . I ALOT delay pedals thing limitless except 2 second loop capabilities . This pedal amazing . It many functions . Unless need worry plastic . I love pedal I would completely recommend .

345	I 'm using mandolin . Perfect clear loud picking . When I want gentle muted tone I use Pro tiny picks , much much smaller pictured . I small hands work . They slippery helps .

Perfect grip leads perfect thickness . I 'd order I .

These thickest picks I 've ever used . However , I really liking . The tone give seems better ears anything I 've tried speed picking improved . I 've tried every standard pick - even bone , silver & really expensive ones . These little Dunlop stubby jazz picks favorite - 're cheap ! Great guitar also mandolin . They small , takes getting used , though.Play round side fat tone . Play pointy end little better control slightly thinner tone . I bought thinking normal sized BIG stubby picks , obviously n't . They 're sturdy BIG ones bit small comfortable . I still think Amazon whoever else could bit clearer product information , 's still bad . 
346	White thin picks fender , else I say ? They good looking , downside thin picks tend keep buying thin picks keep breaking YOU ARE FAST AND WITH THEM ! I 've always fan Fender Classic picks . They feel right , wear well , make nice sound conjunction good set strings Telecaster . I also think price pretty fair . These guitar picks I n't play guitar I ca n't say much fact came said These picks perfect . They right feel medium look awesome . What say picks perfect . If n't used picks , get . They perfect size shape . Your really ca n't beat . Other picks usually let I riff melt faces playing blues jazz gospel etc. , Fender heavies made make notes sound like hit real . I prefer cheap imitations . Only Fender Heavies . That 's I smoke . Like reviewer wrote previously , I received less picks advertised ( I received total 7 picks ) . I n't know people customs `` borrowed '' , I find strange one person problem . Other , picks good , seem durable produce nice sound . I bass guitar sometimes us pick . Seen work great needed . Looks good : ) I used Fender Medium picks since late 60 's . Yes , made China ( ! ! ) still pick far I tell . The picks arrived fully sealed outer envelope contained within nice little mini zip-lock baggie . All 12 , Fender Mediums .

Best guitar picks . Great shape , sturdy . No fancy expensive flashy grip features . Guitar pics God 's Rock intended . The Fender medium second choice first 'Just Strings ' pick exact shapewith softer ( less scrape ) feel strings half price.Pick choice like guitars amps ; everyone different opinion . Fender Medium , favorite guitar pick , dozen last right ? When slip away I 'll order . 
347	Buttons fine , however I installing screw broke inside guitar ( right thread ) . And I even pre-drill . way I get : ( find real screw drill new hole next ( slightly off-center ) A bit wimpy , far holding . This exactly I needed worked great . It would nice felt pads included buttons . I pay another dollar local guitar shop felt padded washers . I ordered strap buttons upgrade existing buttons . I recently purchased beautiful guitar straps needed new buttons . These filler items much larger purachse . Thanks . They work nice guitar , make sure use glue wood screw installing .This help stay wood back . They fit fine . Works described lol . Comes screws & # 34 ; cotton & # 34 ; washers dont scratch body . Not exciting item , I 'll admit , work advertised I love strap buttons instruments . What say except mounted properly , came right screws I didnt issues . LOL

349	put Fender dreadnaught wish held next step quality mic well ... Love death , installed love sound versatility . built volume knob GREAT tough . I could go , reviews tube better Job . I like fact & # 34 ; partially & # 34 ; installed cord coming sound hole easily installed permanent basis cutting cord length running inside guitar body end pin hole ( enlarged bit ) . Either way , plugged , sounds great . This pickup maintains great acoustic sound guitar , Blueridge . I installed Fishman & # 34 ; saddle & # 34 ; pickups Martin guitars pickup sounds good , better . If n't mind pickup visible sound hole , way go . Another nice thing ease changing batteries compared undersaddle type pickups batteries attached inside body guitar . This bad product , great . As soon I received , I installed custom made Guitar , played two hours . Installation fast , took couple minutes . My problems 3 fold : # 1 . Sounds bit `` tinny '' = much high end , equal amount bass . # 2 . A small complaint dismantle entire installation change batteries , I could n't get mine work `` passive '' mode . # 3 . And biggest complaint , volume control difficult get 're performing stage . You stick finger hole top side strings fumble around trying change volume sensitive sudden loud soft . Like I said , bad product , top notch , definitely professionals . If 're fooling around home , recording home , fine , job . BUT ! ! ! If 're pro , 'll want spend double money get R. Baggs M-80 . The M-80 gives truest sound ( unbelievable ) , works passive mode , easy change volume control . Sincerely , Doc Great pickup , combined Fishman Aura Spectrum D.I . excellent experience . Even pick quality amp make happy . I looking sound hole pickup came one best found I expected . I use practice recording . I really like price I wish bit otherwise perfect .

350	run laptop behringer mixer . windows 7 didnt need install drivers , plug n play . reaper picks immediately , arm track , set level record . I offer thistid bit information problem little signal mixer uca 222 reaperhad track distorting . I found others issue . I right click volumespeaker bottom right task bar computer , click `` recording devices '' , select uca222 ( internal microphone ) list , click `` properties '' bottom Sound window , select `` levels '' tab reduce level around 2 3 equal volume themixer windows 7 Reaper . Until , every signal Reaper hot would distort even mixer output set next tried everything reaper resolve issue finally search others problem.So far behringer uca 222 working great . signal clean . This interface alright , nothing special , guy budget . You use record old tapes records go straight interface computer via USB . There pretty much little latency n't noticeable . I plan buying tascam interface soon around $ 70.00 make things better . I still use record anything TV like I said , old tapes . The software bundle pretty much free , find everything internet , bundled together , nice . bought idea `` FULL '' version behringer 's sequence program came ... says `` compact version '' OTHER X Users ? ? ? ? -- -- worth yer timeyer better spending money 's 's WORK OSX Cubase garageband ... another interface `` guess '' long want use RCA plugs ... ! $ % uses RCA interface analog instruments puter ? ? ? ? based software im sorta sour yer owner I would GET IT ! ! ! ! cheapest way `` intro '' yer way interface ... .. Mainly im talkning truying way thru music digital interface Keyboard sequencingfor THOSE users yer better buying pizza probably ... Pros : - Price point- Does job : - USB cable ; susceptible interference ( could work minimal circuitry around use ) - Cheap plastic construction This device converter works RCA inputs outputs . The Input seems geared range consumer level audio range . This box also ability monitor input directly headphones . I 'll brief point : + Works audio interface line level signal . I used Samson Is compact USB cable long The red color looks Has headphone volume control+ Plug play . No extra drivers needed . I use ASIO Cheap . There 's NO audio interface Latency fairly low . Not Plastic RCA connectors . Not big deal wouldve perfect dual plugs phono ( 1/4 inch ) .- 16 bit sampling . Should 24 bit maybe . Even DigiTech RP255 built audio interface . I previously UCA-202 worked great couple years I noticed audio went dead one RCA phono input jacks ( I used jacks previously issues ) . Regardless , I liked UCA-202 much I got UCA222 replace without hesitation , plus bonus , 's purdier ! : ) Plugged , fired PC , new UCA222 started working immediately ... muss , fuss ! For money , I n't think find better deal enhancing PC 's audio versatility . I n't know I 'll even bother included software I use great program called Mixcraft ( btw , check 're looking PC recording simplicity sounds impressive , costlier guys ) . Anyway , two thumbs way UCA222 ! I three units ( one Red 222 two Grey 202 ) use output midi sounds laptops internal sound pro PA system ( mostly Mackie gear ) live performance occasionally add sounds recordings 24 track home studio . This unit quiet handy . The price dead cheap . I two similar units ( Lexicon Alpha smaller Lexicon boxes ) cost much . Yes Lexicon boxes provide lot different inputs outputs nice need portable basic input/output sound card quiet easy install ( plug ) , buy reviews talk `` cheap '' plastic . Yes plastic ( many expensive units ) I throwing boxes equipment yet break one problems . I also admit I n't abuse equipment purpose , I gentle either dropped several times software comes 222 package good , case I really n't need . I software Audition I would like take moment say something included Audacity . One reviewer wrote `` low , '' quality software . That could n't truth . I used software years studio high quality software . It work 16 24 bit processing , input output almost every type audio format ( .wav , MP3 , etc. ) . It also ton nice free downloads ( compressors , EQ 's , sonic etc . ) Audacity web site . Audacity started life shareware purchased Sound turn bought Sony . This high quality studio software still download use free 's trial software 30 days block important features . I would add really make work well need use preferences section set higher quality settings available . As I remember defaults set mid level quality average home user use without taxing computer resources.The bottom line Behringer units ( 202 222 ) work great I ca n't hear see difference color added software included 222 package . For low price ca n't go wrong . yo interface hook know stuff feel . thx behringer . 
351	I use time testing audio cables works great ! It 's got metal housing seems sturdy . Battery lasts months . Well done Behringer ! Solidly built , small tester easily carried around gig bag . There n't really much way instructions , LEDs fairly well labeled straight forward enough figure . If band sound guy band got ta one . The time stress saved depending trial error eliminate cable priceless . Bottom line ! ! ! eliminate variable audio problems faster easier solve . A must every gig bag checking cables . I keep battery tester active 's . Sure eliminates lot guess work first hint audio trouble . Easy use economical product . If 'd ever setting stage discover hum hiss box . It find bad intermittent heart beat . It locate shorted XLR open ground fast . Do n't go onto stage without one boxes . We bought tester son use band 's equipment set-up . It appears well constructed , help problems cables work equipment connection issues . I using tester year test XLR cables I come contact work . It works detect faults ( non intermittent ones ) , comes durable enough housing compact enough take everywhere . Does great job checking cords . Was able eliminate lot bad cords stash . multiple types cords also ! I picked Behringer CT100 cable tester takes guesswork maintaining cable collection . The unit job well helped find several bad cables I previously thought ok . It well built sturdy . The bottom tester sharp metal corners screws could damage wooden table . I suggest get adhesive rubber pads support underside.Although machine good , accompanying documentation awful . It presupposes working knowledge audio equipment many users may lack . For example , include LCD readout look cable good bad . I go audio engineering forum find diagram . As turns , Behringer CT100 inexpensive knockoff Morley cable tester . The manual Morley unit available online diagrams make testing easier understand . This thing test cables musician use ... rugged , reliable simple understand ... price , hard beat ... , compact , extremely sturdy . All metal enclosure good quality jacks , simple understand LED readouts . Runs 2 AA set apart slightly : tone ' function sends known volume signal line . Very helpful level adjustments long chains ' issue indication - This made choose model . If 's even shortest dropout , LEDs indicate . issues annoying difficult troubleshoot.My complaints : -The small screw holding battery cover stripped immediately initially inserting batteries . It like bar soap knife . Quite frustrating . Used change phillips slotted screw , managed get 's included belt clip attaches two screws back . This clip blocks access battery compartment , ridiculous . Luckily I need clip . I used one screws intended clip replacement stripped battery cover screw.-No rubber feet bottom + metal enclosure + battery cover screw = sliding around marring whatever sits . I stuck re-purposed rubber feet solving ' situations mentioned , thing 5 star product . Too bad could n't go extra step make 5 star box . 
352	Classic design . I remember 35 years ago high school band . They n't changed much , n't fix 's broken . My son uses practicing home electric bass ( Jazz Band ) standup bass ( Orchestra ) . It solid , yet flexible height angle . Assembly breeze . This classic music stand schools also excellent home use . Built like tank . Should last forever passed next generation musicians family . This heavier duty higher quality music stand . It accommodate big fake sheets , I love . Some people complained plastic hinges fragile , fine n't use excessive muscle . It 's survived clumsiness I load 4 pounds guitar books without breaking sweat . The well built , sturdy well balanced enough I concerns tipping , even loaded several music books folder sheet music . The tray wide appropriately sized lip , moveable moderate effort . Once place stays slipping . For solid construction feel heavy easy move around , although would little awkward transport small one purchases number alternatives , I always concern I want I get ... case winner . Delivered promised good condition appropriately packed . This one want . It 's timeless classic , built like tank , worth every penny . An investment musical future ! Made U.S.A. great thing see . Nothing Chinese CRAP sale anymore . ( I 'm looking YOU . ) Sadly , nice ones I remember high school band attachment clutch EXTREMELY thin gauge metal . Who knows REAL QUALITY would cost days ? Still , I feel good knowing English speaking , tax paying U.S. got meet house making these.GOD U.S.A . 
353	I 've tried 3 types , 're pretty much . I n't really find huge difference tone relative rubber , small degree . To dull sounding acoustic . Well , n't sound bad , switch normal pick 'll notice upper upper-mid harmonics duller attack . It n't sound bad , certain applications would fine . I would n't want everyday acoustic tone , though.THey fare much better electric guitar , difference attack less notable , 'll still notice loss `` sparkle '' . But part I found sound agreeable useable . The pick tends catch strings bit - 's friction , course - 's something get used to.The bottom line : I like , 'll probably last almost forever , I n't really see becoming go-to picks . I like thickness feel ( wo n't slip hand playing ) loss high end enough I n't think I want limit way , except certain situations . I tend switch back forth pick fingers anyway , I already get sound similar using fingers . Worth try , though , might find keeper need tame amp guitar 's bit bright . You know , higher volumes , , 's easy high frequencies emphasized , might work better live setting 've got amp cranked . I usually use fingers strum tenor uke , songs pick appropriate . I used old felt pick made back 1940s , disintegrated time newer felt picks I 've found n't feel same.I bought set soft , medium hard Wedgie picks try I 'm really happy results . I greatly prefer soft Wedgie Uke , I like medium nylon string guitar hard Wedgie 's really nice Jazz Bass . I still use hard plastic picks electric steel string acoustic guitars , Wedgie 's fantastic I need fingerlike sound instruments.I 'd love see slightly larger version pick someday , still works well . This great pick use picks , need softer sound occasionally . Much easier getting fingers tangled . The negative way seem packed . They come three colors colors stand soft , medium , hard . They also come 3 5mm size grip thickness ( grip pick . ) The white soft , medium grey medium , dark grey hard . I use white medium grey 3.1mm find easy adjust . They soft wear fairly quickly , keep playing little cutting sharpen back . You get nice soft tone , like using plectrum , develop picking style get various tones ( double bass , acoustic , finger style , etc . I use soft picks smooth tone , medium pick deep jazzy sound ( think Motown . ) I never leave home without least three gig bag.For real trip , able finger pick , try Jam Cat pick holder sold . It easy switch finger pick instant always need rock bit . I like medium version picks lot , & I ordered hard ones 3.1mm thickness -- pretty thick , way . So plan using basses acoustic guitars unless electric unusually wide neck heavy strings . These soft ones much give opinion , makes difficult handle -- 's great eliminate pick noise , softer ones want cling strings require player make many adjustments . My verdict : go medium hard version . It 's great pick soft sound , I would n't use aggressive work , slow ballads 's great . Bought I thought 'd nice alternative plastic nylon pick use ukulele I want different sound finger picking strumming produce . They give great tone without hearing pick strike string , n't wear strings I actually use occasion 3/4 steel string acoustic guitar I want nice mellow tone . The negative rubber , & # 34 ; stick & # 34 ; strings , n't great quick strumming , I wish . First time soft wedgie ... ... pick ( I older brother : ) ) . I used new ukulele sounds feels great . Very good price looks like last highly recommend try , n't like give fellow & # 34 ; soft wedgie & # 34 ; may like . I like picks use ukulele , makes strumming lot easier old hands mine . It sounds exactly like sound make strumming fingers , seem sturdy enough last awhile . A worthwhile buy tired fingers : - ) I purchased 3 pack soft rubber wedgie 's add-on larger order . As , I found reasonable value . However , I 'm sure long last steel string acoustic . I think picks would fantastic classical nylon string guitar `` uke '' . They grippy slight one side additional comfort.I love soft warm sound provide . I use mostly late night I ca n't sleep want play , rest family still sleeping . Not quite effective E , A , D steel strings certainly playable . Not great strumming , fun pick individual chords . Thanks.SPO These picks cut pick noise acoustic guitar wear rapidly leave rubbery residue guitar . I n't like thought damage stuff would time inside guitar stuff getting pickups , etc . Big disappointment . I 'm getting lot high string guitar sound thought picks might solve problem . Back drawing board I go . 
354	I bought Takamine acoustic/electric guitar fits snugly job well.I happy low price I got , pleased overall quality exceeded expectations . It works I need ! It arrived earlier I expected ! Really nice ! My guitar safe hard case ! The case nice sturdy . It lasted year last years come . The inside nice soft big pocket put things like picks , tuners , capos .

Martin name means quality . martins doubt , excellent strings . The light strings carry excellent deep tone hard fingers . These strings sound great acoustic properly tuned , I bought local shop looking different brand . The owner shop reccomended part setup . I like lighter sounds , using capo makes sound great also .

358	I bought one one heavier guitars hoping shoulder relief job . It 's inexpensive padding excellent . It looks like last . I got use 12 string . It huge improvement strap , padded 'll pay higher price . It job , however . For price satisfied . My new electric guitar n't particularly comfortable play sitting , I needed strap . I 've played straps past always found uncomfortable , I hoped find padded strap n't break bank . This strap fits bill fine . Depending angle pegs set , however , may find holes strap time enlarge point guitar always danger falling . If pegs set angle , like Strat , strap last forever . If 're guitar horizontal peg , like LP , 'll probably want invest strap locks well . This move pressure strap holes metal locks extend lifetime strap security . The padding OK , great - however , 's certainly better regular nylon strap good job forcing strap lay flat across shoulder huge bonus . quality . The shoulder strap tends move play . Gets job done , serious guitarist . I enjoy using strap guitars . Easy install remove . 5 stars seller strap Decent quality price . Fits acoustic guitar intended seems comfortable person purchased . Bought strap provide extra comfort young son hold relatively heavy electric guitar . make better woudl slidable padding , padded area longer . This guitar strap performs expected 's price . Great entry level guitar strap getting started ( backup strap ) .

362	I idea happened anyone else problem , I got literally 8 plug-ins , part plug existing cable make chain . It 's like I got extension cord male outlets ends . Soooo 's pretty much useless . I guess get one power blocks 9v outlets , I guess could plug I really see point . I would 've shipped back I lost packaging wrote loss . I think I payed like $ 8 whatever . I would recommend going actual music store physically see male ends female end . This daisy chain worked well - problems yet . I 'm powering six pedals currently , I able use one without problems change sound . I think great way power basic effects without breaking bank , work single spot A/C adapter might already , need buy another . I recently received multi plug cable ( daisy chain ) use guitar pedals I pleased one spots , product . I tell built last cable eight plugs spaced enough allow put pedals I like . It plugged Behringer 9 volt power adapter nicely . Its nice replace 9 volt batteries every week . A real money saver long run . Buy cable . I ordered plug advertised & # 34 ; 1 Spot & # 34 ; brand plug . It I received . Instead I received generic plug eight 9v connections would definitely fit purpose , really cheap version . The plugs generic version larger 1 Spot wires kind stiff plastic . The original 1 Spot plug much smaller plugs , great saving space pedal board , wires soft & # 34 ; rubbery & # 34 ; , making easier work pedal board , specially 're working pedal board like Pedaltrain wires bars . I informed seller issue told mistake would send correct one . In email I included image original packaging 1 Spot 8 Plug make sure would mistake , amazement sent another compatible plug . I emailed refund , promptly . I say , respond quickly refunded money . I imagine order plug without ever worked original 1 Spot plug , would n't know difference although really cheap version eight 9v connectors . I strongly recommend , spend extra two three dollars get original 1 Spot 8 Plug . This cheapest effective way saving lot money wasted 9v batteries always run gig , rather n't matter . power supply - still cheaper 9v ones supplied manufacturer . This cable expands capability One-Spot Godlyke 9V adapter . The quality good length plugs adequate pedal boards . After reading bunch reviews product , sure buying , give try completely satisfy , n't ad noise pedal chain , use radioshack power supply 9v 2.5 A , tell sound came electric issues.I 'm saying better voodoo lab power brick , work perfect n't see taking . Man ... I saw things light came head ... & # 34 ; uh , duh & # 34 ; noise , plenty length nicely spaced right-angle plugs standard 9V DC complaints noise cables symptom something wrong within setup.I old wall-wart laying around put good use.Check total amount amperage draw ( usually milliamps ) make sure wall-wart handle daisy-chain away ! I 2 one spots came 5 multi plug cable , reading little bit internet I read one spots handle almost 10 pedals ( depends pedal , power handling etc . ) So I saw 8 plug cable figured I would try . With adding many pedals board , perfect . recommend alot pedals want plug . nice good like fine great fantastic like love nice good like love happy free

364	I 'm using V1 5 watt tube amp . It 's really nice . I tried NOS route I much prefer tube . The good thing comes box JJ , unlike tubes places I 've ordered seem lose original boxes along way looks like everyone brother messing . I VOX AC4TV . It uses ( stock ) 12AX7 , I thought I would try 12AT7 see happened . I read type tube could give clean little test run , first impression amp noticeably quieter tube installed . It might reduced volume third - came benefit amp noticeably less noisy . That nice benefit.I n't notice much change tonally . I think tube basically brought volume . I would n't say better worse 12AX7 , quieter , significantly less ended switching back 12AX7 . I bought tube test friends Fender HRD PI spot . He wanted clean tone willing less overall gain . He liked result I switched GT 12AX7 . I want try 12AT7 next , JJ good job . Also interested swapping GT ( Sovtek ) 's JJ 's . I found tube sound pleasant , cheaper cost Electro-Harmonix , work , unlike tubes I received . JJ 's great tubes ! This 12AT7 replaced 12AX7 preamp Epi Valve Jr soften gain sweeten tone- nice , I found old American made I like JJ still great tube .

366	They sent 1mm ( Blue ) mistake turns I prefer size testing . Fast shipping . I play bass rock/metal These nice sturdy sound real clean.I 'm better luck heavier acoustic strings.I still get used harder picks electrics . I used swear Hard stiff picks Les Paul Custom , I recently bought Strat re-issue -- TOO FUN fast rhythms Phase 90 ( phaser ) pedals ! ! !

I like bright color easy found , seems right strumming acoustic guitar . They work well Dunlop pick ; n't crack , big plus use general Fender variety . I go little thicker I would regular plastic picks , get flimsy . Take note price picks shipping cost - might cheaper go nearest music store . I 've used everything think way picks Tortex one favorites . I least 100 various thickness ' Claytons , I need . The Claytons great , times I want different thichness Tortex Claytons find perfect pick anything want play . They last forever great got ta try I bought .73 mm picks & I would consider medium thickness . If like lighter get smaller thickness like heavy go larger thickness . The .73 mm right , I really like . Love picks . Have used years . Feel firm yet still flex needed last forever . Highly recommend . I 've always used Planet Waves nails I wanted try Dunlop buying little package . A good experience . Durable , comfortable texture makes easy use allow slip easily . I know pick choosing personal matter . I choose specific model thickness flexibility perfect . I use Dunlop Orange thickness perfect . I hit strings , hard picks heavy enough get job done yet I n't break many strings . 've using tortex picks years wo n't buy others . feel great , n't fall hands , decent life span ( plus turtle logo sweet ) Great picks beginners pros alike ! Go thinner picks like versatility playing . I think Tortex / Delrin picks standard others judged , good gripping surface , easy identify thicknesses way I think improve would replace black ink logo script sort raised fingers smudge grip would even look `` Picks '' get idea I mean . I 've huge fan dunlop picks long time . I started playing 15 years ago , used slim , floppy picks long time . As time went guitar skills grew , I needed pick sturdy , would n't flex play intricate detailed songs.The tortex purples favorite , 're thickest ones I find . I like soft sandy feel . They n't slip hand easily , 're thick , take long time wear . I like picks lot ! They super strong look like take lot use good shape ! Recommended Yes . The 1.0mm Tortex picks BLUE ! I quite surprised number reviewers complained getting pack . If anyone ever ANY guitar shop , Tortex Picks color coded ! Anyway , I 've playing guitar 15 years . I 've using Blue Tortex picks 14 . At first I messed around different picks I could get hands . small ; Fender brand slippery ; Guitar Center brand wore quickly ; Jim Dunlop nylon picks felt weird . The 1.0mm Tortex give right sound attack , n't feel flimsy fingers ( I keep tight grip ) grip far superior market ( gator grips feel porous . ) Durability wise , I 'll lose pick even comes close wearing ! Whatever size looking Dunlop best option . It lasts long , sounds great , feels nice . It probably pick among companies . I recommend orange one beginners , general would go much higher green ones gets heavy feel comfortable anymore sound well , totally want . Either way , Dunlop best great price . I 've always used dunlop picks , I 've tried ones like fender , dunlop picks well feel right , I 've never like thicker picks picks weird grips feel right playing , give try ! ... 'll wind cool little turtle tortex sticker instead I 've playing guitar 40 years , Tortex picks nearly worst I ' v ever used . They noisy overpower guitar strings noise . Dunlop Ultex picks sound much better . thankfully still picks . 'm always losing , work super well always buy brand . I looking something able bend bit fall shape stay bent much use great . They good tension still sound nice acoustic grip great . It 's almost like layer felt . It sucks hands cold pick keeps slipping fingers ... n't want keep fingers breather warm air easy hold onto matter condition . I 've using picks 10+ years , 've always great . Between blues yellow , I 'm covered . I love picks . The flex right , last forever . I never one break . If n't know type pick like , buy sample pack . Picks make big difference sound playability . These thin flexible . Easier use beginners easier strumming general . However tone different . So 'll need decide songs work , far quality , great . Easy grip , durable . Good picks , great feel brings sound loudly . Mostly Electrics . I prefer lighter sound Acoustic work well friends Electric , Fender . I used use lot thinner pick reading article Paul saying order play fast need minimum 1mm . These things great yes , I shred faster ! If thought pick pick ( like I long ago ) would probably come realize would mistake assume position playing playing strength increases attack and/or use Dunlop Tortex 1.14mm playing I using thin medium picks read guitar magazine along hearing several friends heavy pick better . Why ? After messing I found player able fully control pick let pick interfere input attack . The interference thin medium pick give , slackens hard . With heavy gauge pick lack rigidity slack introduced player picks tried liked using heavy gauge picks since mid like Dunlops feel , grip , durability . They hold long time . How long ? I last years . They incredible bargain given long lasting students use , I n't demand , I stress control aspects picks different recommended . You wo n't disappointed . Finally decided getting 1.00mm picks I n't like thin thick , perfect gauge I looking hoping . The logo wear uses I n't much . Been using daily basis practice far 's wearing fast . Recommended ! I think great price give . John Mayer uses picks one favorite guitarist I sticking . I 've used picks years great results . If 've never used stile picks wo n't sorry . In fit curiosity , I decided I would check picks . After spending much money various brands picks , including every model DAVA picks , I came back home Dunlop Tortex green . They stil play great , sound great steel strings , last long time . These pluck Guitar Bass strings decently . If want one set cover applications , good choice . I like . Grip good thickness right . I wish tip sharper good Tortex great really like picks may better fit bill prefer yellow ones little thinner The thickness pick use matter personal preference . For style , .60 Dunlop Tortex perfect . The surface matte slick . I n't think I ever worn one unusable ; seem last forever ( 're lost ) . I 've tried brands picks made materials , I always come back . I 'll probably buried one hand ! ordered one pack got entire box ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! either way picks great although would suggest Jazz picks I always keep lot hand . These picks I use playing acoustic guitars ( strumming style & vocals ) . Since I play several hours nearly every day I tendency go lot picks . These definitely last longer brands ( similar weight ) I used . For example , I & # 34 ; round-off & # 34 ; end Musician 's Gear pick Fender pick hour playing seem get much mileage picks . The weight great style playing . They seem durable brands . They 're inexpensive since I play lot hours I always keep lots hand . I love 'em , use daily , rely ! ! ! I love Tortex .50mm picks ( red ) . I one 's 4 years old still going strong ! Yes , turtle writing eventually get rubbed , never leave black residue pick strings . I use red , yellow , orange Tortex 's exclusively practice performance ( I 'm church worship leader ) . My highest recommendation . I love picks playing acoustic .

And picks inexpensive enough keep endless supply . These guitar picks best . Simply put . They easy grip onto , even hands sweaty rocking day . Highly recommended . I never use guitar pick Dunlop Tortex . I use green picks , also orange ones . I recommend buy green picks orange picks . Great beginners pros .

I played several years stopped playing lack time . I recently started playing looking perfect pick classic rock ( I old Ibanez Les Paul Custom ) tried several picks quest . There several I liked ( several I n't ) thus far favorite 1.0mm Tortex ( blue ) picks . They nice , almost powdery , matte feel minimizes slippage n't break , though fairly stiff . Depending playing various thicknesses available , people find something suitable personal preferences . I wo n't say I never try anything else , thus far I find picking 1.0 Tortex picks . I n't seem drop compared picks I used past seemed slip ... . I absolutely love feel guitar picks ! They grippy , I n't broken single one yet , stand junk studio , 's hard loose , I still . If like child , nephew , niece , sibling , parent plays guitar bass ca n't go wrong getting , guitarist playing cheap little Fender picks break strum chord , lucky enough break , slip hands 're playing . They little thin rhythm playing however , I recommend .88 mm picks . favorite picks .

367	pleased I n't know best ( n't tried ) , I 've tried , none better . D'Addarios top quality , reasonably priced . My choice 12 string 6 string acoustics . Nice bright full sound . Good life , sound good couple months . Inexpensive . Fast delivery . I happy product . Guitar tone subjective almost topic . And I 'm sure brand loyalty much perception tone . Even , D'Addario provided consistent product years I 'll readily admit knowing . I 've used may brands , I seem always return D'Addario steel stringed acoustic guitars . These strings soothed poor sore fingertips ... They light play make practising easier whille building callouses ; ) 
368	Love Elixir strings ! I bought first pack , 7 years ago I 've hooked . They last , least , twice long traditional copper wound strings , sound even better . GET THESE ! These make cheap $ 50 acoustic guitar , sound almost good Martin ... kidding . I first discovered Elixir strings I purchased Taylor I 've convert ever since . They cost roughly two three times much uncoated strings well worth . If hands play , product keep strings sounding new fresh . They sound great Martin ! I used strings years great price . Shipping time good . Purchased strings tried Blue Steel strings son 's acoustic guitar . He prefers Elixir strings Blue Steel strings . He says last lot longer sound better , . I started using suggestion friend couple years sound great hold tone long time.I jam friends couple times week strings hold long time ! ! My husband got n't get dirty quickly , plus . Initially sounds n't clear uncoated ones , wears couple hours play would n't know difference . He 'll buy . No difference putting new strings regular kind . I using strings 7 years . At first I used Elixir Polywebs , things broke time . I switched n't broke string since . If play Gibson Martin I would buy heavier string , match well 414ce Taylor . Because price I n't use cheap Fender Acoustic , I suggest Earthwoods . I even use Electric version strings American , pleased well . Elixir favorite brand strings . I bought seeking strings longer life ( bad experience w/ D'Addario strings lasted week 2 ) boy 'll tell babies LAST ! change strings twice year & coating makes comfortable & easier slide strings . I love bright sound get easy tune & also keep tune good & overall string must try EVERY guitarist By far best acoustic strings , period . They sound great , last forever . Nanoweb Electric Custom Light Guitar best electric strings ever , best acoustic strings . Fantastic . What I say , I string snob ! Ive tried MANY different kinds strings acoustics Elixir Nanowebs far best strings I ever played.I set another major brand cheap Washburn I bought , I changed strings WOW HUGE difference . The guitar great ring it.Also use Taylors . These give quitar beautiful voice ! Pros : : Price 
369	Elixir strings favorite choice strings 8 Guitars . They smooth bending breeze . They last longer brands I 've used . I use little Finger Grease Spray I would recommend anyone . Without changing pickups polishing frets , I thought I 'd try get little sustain switching strings . At first I thought I got bum buy I bring action bit account brightness strings . Had tone I ready dig set back trash ... .. played half hour ( went exact thing Polywebs I put ) retuned , sounded pretty good . Played another half hour retuned actually sounds great . Dropped action back 's smooth silk hour 's time . VERY HIGHLY RECOMMEND The title says . They 're Elixirs , ca n't go wrong Elixirs . Trust , I 've played 13 years . I liked Elixir strings acoustic , I knew ones electric would worth extra money ( compared non-coated brands ) . They seem create less noise unintentional slide friction -- 's sort like difference flatwound regular strings -- feel like super-flatwound strings , meaning feel smooth . I nice built , I imagine I 'd like strings even I starting ( restarting ) I imagine tear fingertips much less non-coated strings . I put one Gibson Les Pauls ' far good . Great sound wear one session , unlike D'Addario strings.I update weeks I see long last . Good strings electric guitar.I liked product sound , easy change much . Bought son 's electric guitar . He loves brand ! They sound great seem last longer brands . Price great ! Elixir strings nice . slick last forever compared standard strings..But admit D addario strings good replaced often . So money want try technology advanced strings dont think disappointed . Some people say slick.. see put new strings expect feel certain way.. But get see long last . Been using years . They feel great , last longer string importantly , sound cost little strings 're worth . Totally awesome strings . I 've heard strings great , I highly recommend everyone try n't . Outstanding string life , superior sound , ease sliding , I get strings every time . Elixirs life ! I 'd pay double strings day . As professional guitar player , I always nervous playing show & # 34 ; old & # 34 ; strings . However , I 've using Elixir 2 years , strings really last long time . I would usually replace strings every month , I 've started leaving 6 months . These guitar strings nice I love . I always buy brand . They work well sound amazing . After reviews I expected Strings Ever , golden strands would last year sparkling tonal perfection ! Instead , I got decent set .10 's lasted whole hour D snapped neck pickup . I use PRS Wilkinson bridge rarely breaks strings , I pre-stretch gently completely . Plus I tune Eb vocal breakage reasons , I break normal strings , Slinky .10 's . Ergo , break one hour thick string minimal tension , tuned , unacceptable , especially strings cost three times much electric strings.As tone , 's definitely bright almost edgy , nicely zingy told . Yet one negative I 've noticed 8 hours ' loud playing drummer things seem vibrate widely strings , making harder tune . Sounds odd , I know , I replaced D Slinky D ( replacing singles ai n't cheap either triple price , please note ) , I 've since noticed tunes faster tighter range Elixir strings.So , I must say I 'm summarily unimpressed far Elixir electric strings.What 's good string lasting long time breaks fast ? Especially costs three times ? And 's tuning thing ? And cost much , anyhow ? Is coating siliconish stuff really worth two bucks extra string ? Not string toast 50 minutes , zero doubt there.Anyhow , I 've got five Elixirs one Slinky main ax , age I 'll get good feel Elixirs stay tune hold tone , I 'll report back . And way , Slinky D sounds almost exactly Elixirs , tonally . So much Magic Elixir n't get wrong , I really want love , I hate changing strings , guys , quality control ? If I 'm going pay triple price , crazy expect triple quality ? Or heck , even little better ... PS If look D'Addario reviews ( I love acoustic strings ) , respond many reviews questions . I hope Elixir address questions . [ Edit : And , six hours ' playing guitar , B string popped place D , neck pickup . Once I ask : good strings `` sound good three times longer '' break three times faster ? ] [ Edit : . Come ! After four hours , A string went . I play ax one two sessions week , next time I drummer , `` Which one go today ? '' He said 's amazed G still , plays knows G takes tension . An hour later , guess ? Yep . So 's four broken strings less 20 hours ' play . Seriously ? Not good deal 9 bucks , I 'd bummed cost 3 bucks . The plus I think point sounded good new , dang , unless play totally smooth jazz , I 'd stick Slinkies D'Addarios . Unless I got `` bad set '' , seems kinda lame triple normal price . In case , Elixirs worth money . ] [ Edit , : I called Elixir told multiple breakage , sent another set . That set taken four hour hard rock sessions breaks yet , thought tuning issue remains . I 'll add star good customer service hope perhaps first set dud . But honestly , price , duds . ] These favorite brand strings.When beginner years back 1st strings bought electric ( since used acoustic ) And say , elixir favorite brand strings . They last long , easy tune , & nice bright sound & take proper care ( wipe done playing , keep guitar gig bag using , . ) bright sound last 6 MONTHS OR MORE ! ! usually buy two sets year & im HEAVY player play hours . I love coating aswell medium gauge & usually n't coating get light gauge strings , overall strings awesome & must buy every guitarist ! great set strings I stick elixir strings whether electric acoustic great brand know . 
370	Now I create charts fly quickly perfectly straight lines . 5 frets allows enough room complicated chords even scales . A must guitar teachers IMHO . This large ? I ca n't see anything smaller could use . The lines strings frets close together . See previous evaluation similar product . It matter large want chord chart . I 'm amateur musician songwriter helpful songwriting ideas . I n't studied music formally , I ca n't recall C # 7 looks like versus F # 7 I discover chord shape 's easier diagram look web . This helps . No moving parts . No high tech components . The ultimate low tech . It 's rubber stamp works intended purpose . I find size useful I guess depends individual 's needs . Enough said . I BOUGHT BOTH THIS STAMP FOR GUITAR AND ALSO ONE FROM THE SAME FOR MANDOLIN , UKULELE , BANJO . I 'M PLEASED WITH BOTH . LARGE TO SEE , USEFUL TO STAMP CHORDS ON MY OWN MUSIC AND OTHER MUSIC THAT NOT HAVE GUITAR CHORDS . 
371	Solid music stand made heavy metal poles solid metal music holder . The joints tighten made plastic material . If anything give use would plastic parts . Right brand new condition everything fits well grips solidly hold poles place . Arrived day . good purchase . I expected bit job . I would like plate heavier , seems little I surprised well stand made . It 's worth $ 45 easily . I ; used stands 27 years best I ; owned ! Wanted buy better stand cheap metal folding one I 'd high school . This great compromise portability/storage sturdiness . I want collapsible legs , , solid coated metal shelf wonderful old metal folding stand . Works well Manhasset second shelf accessory , constant use months . I 've absolutely problems . The height easily adjustable , shelf tilt easy . Am happy I got price I paid ! This largest top stands , one I use traveling / gigs . The top n't fold like expensive Stagg Hercules stands , 're using gigging , may something consider . I lug weighted piano around , n't mind lugging . This great music stand , I like 's adjustable various ways customize exact position need . It 's sturdy well built . I n't ever worry 'll tip . I love . I would recommend . Solid enough room sheet music . Very portable , though holder challenge times . I another stand collapses compact unit , heavy tomes wish use several sheets want string ... unit superior . This music stand great quality great price.I pleased . I bought On-Stage stands past , sure I would n't I right.Very sturdy-well price . I purchased model home use -- kid 's backpack . It 's solid sturdy , easily holding song book open -- pieces sheet music . It adjusts tall enough standing well low enough sit next easy chair evening . I often clip digital recorder practice threat top flipping . Works ! I 'm happy stand . It heavy , I knew going . But purposes , plus . The weight makes sturdy . It folds , quite portable , despite weight . Adjusts easily holds position . Purchased another folding stand cost $ $ $ literally fell apart . This one much better although quite portable . On plus side , music stays put one , 's stable height fully adjustable . You buy confidence . This easy put together ! Top slips folding bottom part stand adjustable . Love ! I pleased music stand . It working well holds heavy music binders far . I would recommend others try . On-Stage makes decent products , one would awesome actual table stand would fold one times . That would perfect ! Otherwise , works fine . This great music stand . Very solid feel . No need tighten . It holds heaviest books without tipping . I left trusty Manhasset behind job replace I came upon alternative offered Amazon . As banged Manhasset get week-end warriors like simply throw top everything else long ride home , I 've never one fail past 40+ years . There 's nothing stand user even adjust , yet moving parts always seem retain right amount tension , preventing 5-10 pound folders lowering top half causing dip forward . But `` rub '' . The feet base permanently attached upper tray holding music . Consequently , ubiquitous , well-proven stands sometimes challenge pack crowded van sedan , especially couple keyboards , amps , instrument stands , requisite gear Amazon 's On-Stage Music Stand becomes attractive ( course , n't hurt costs less Manhasset ) . It permits fold legs position parallel shaft well completely remove upper shelf holds music . Consequently , 's much easier find convenient place -- whether trunk floor back seat -- packing stand . Simply `` slide '' position.The drawback -- apart durability issues reviewers warned ( careful over-tighten set-screws ! ) -- thing heavy . Frankly , I expecting lightweight stand , least compared old Manhasset , 've owned around latter , first thing 're likely notice stand pictured , substantial addition weight . At time , moving parts set screws ( topped plastic , rotating , serrated wheels ) , On-Stage stand n't give amount confidence durability Manhasset -- words , I 'm less likely become careless simply toss top long , 4-hour line : On-Stage appears good value -- truly heavy-duty stand ( respects ) 'll extremely well practice stand studio living room packs conveniently traveling jobs . But n't expect lighten load , simply 's heavier , last longer lot traveling n't plan put one piano folders stand , 's least one truly lightweight ( albeit plastic ) stand 's worked really well ( perhaps needless say , n't -- fall apart 're designed takes 15 minutes simply disassemble put back unforgiving , pint-sized cases ) . But Peak stand made hold ( turn , holds relatively heavy music books ) served well several years ( I stand , I called company , responded immediately sending critical plastic piece become warped , Peak stand problem-free ever since ) . It 'll cost bit , much folks willing spend exchange losing unwanted pounds . I 've purchased types , I keep coming back one . For $ $ 's best buy opinion . On Stage makes nice products . This music stand adjustments one favorite older units . Well made price n't put range everyday musician . Really liking On Stage products , also bought 2 boom mic stands excellent . 
372	These picks really nice tastes run jazz pick direction . It 's easy play fast tricky lines smaller hard picks . give shot great picks , , shorter speed maneuvering sweeps better stumble strings sweep , , works fine use turtle purple big ext well like try experiment see helps spleen sweeps etc , , nice picks well made Good picks replacement jazz 3 I still prefer one , nice backup case run . I 'm really happy Black Ice Heavy picks ( mm ) , I bought badly disappointed last order Dunlop Jazz would call Black Ice picks medium sized . They roughly size shape Fender picks , little bigger Jazz IIIs . They stiffer 551s perhaps touch less stiff IIIs ( thinner IIIs ) .One thing may account nice way Black Ice perform edges beveled smoothly finished way differs 551s ( I still like ) Jazz terms playability , pick shape stiffness.But important thing hardest thing communicate : The tone . I love tone I get picks , best I say I looking pick would generate solid , mellow jazz tone archtop - tone reminds say , Barney ( without Barney 's chops ) . This Black Ice delivers . I like pick , I bought different types variety & # 34 ; Pick & # 34 ; . A suggestion teacher . Good suggestion , depending kind guitar I 'm playing , changes tone . I like one . 
373	Overdrive wont drive ... love price usual danelectro delivered I love products reason sound like couple hundred bucks yet ... . Works great price ! ! I started get pedals I thought I 'd try something cheap like , I dissatisfied . Do n't mistake distortion pedal new , although get distorted tone pedal , boosts volume slight raise gain ( For know shit please n't call , I n't really know I 'm helping ones like simple terms , lol ) . It works great switching abrasive tone solo'ing wanting get loud songs.Definitely would pick one super cheap & # 34 ; I wan na try & # 34 ; pedal . At price range , little effects pedal admirably . You get pretty decent sound . No need spend lot , especially ' e budget pretty good . I took one star tone sort weird sounding high-gain situations . Other I 've problems . Holding well . Yes , pedal plastic , switch durable feeling , knob placement annoying . At less $ 15 , need able look past things . I 've higher failure rate Dunlop Cry Baby thing built like block . This pedal actually sounds pretty good used intended . Which say , pedal nice job preamp tubes valve amplifier . No unless already good amount gain going . No overdrive pedal lives 's potential running solid state ( even modeling ) amplifier . It 's really intended end sounding buzzy . Some complained RF interference use FAB pedals ( getting radio signals amp ) . I happen pedals costing 5x price particularly running long pedal chain . Based tone alone , pedal overdrive tube preamp well anything $ 100 . Check YouTube review pedal guy goes ' . I believe uses strat , pedal sounds GREAT . If blind test pedal overdrive costing north $ 100 may surprised- particularly gear ( amp guitar ) halfway decent . What I note though , pedal wee bit gain little less treble TS type pedals . That n't make worse better- different . The ' actually less pronounced tubescreamer , good thing IMHO . There already enough tubescreamer clones market ! It perform miracles lousy sounding guitars amplifiers . Incidentally , pedal plays well dirt boxes . Since n't true bypass , likely get tone suck run bunch chain , rest pedals decent bypass fine . Lest mistake novice point reference review- I 've playing guitar since 1979 used ' dirt boxes since vintage overpriced . I years past caring brand getting good sounds simple gear . Great little pedal reasonable cost . This pedal durable cause I owned two years held great little cheaper mean good pedal . Sounds great . This thing sounds great tube amps , 2 watt danelectro amp 1962 's 8 inch speaker 12 watt excelsior fender . It good range overdrive levels . It clearly vintage style effect good classic rock dirty lo-fi stuff like The Black Keys , The White , garage band like stuff . It good light tone shaper boost put distortion effect feedback heaven total top sputtering fuzz . I love mine price , good mix compared modded SD-1 overdriven tube amps . It 's different worth mess around . Just bit gentle thick plastic case switch last . Also , blue LED bright . Thats either annoyance great . Rock ! Depending amp guitar , pedal going either really great bummer . It sounds terrific fender strat ( single coil ) Danelectro ( pickups ) solid state amps , giving warm tube like sounds terrible tube amp vintage silvertone amp , really sounds 1980 's Kramer , loaded humbucker 'll either love hate ! That decide mostly type guitar amp use , 's different pedal every combination . The Danelectro FAB series pedals offer great sound without digging budget . The D-2 Overdrive effects pedal works great gives soft growl fuzz works well playing blues ... . The reason I n't give 5 stars & # 34 ; It tends little noisey & # 34 ; turn gain much . You get noise filter add pedal board take care noise problems may . This series pedals ( FAB ) hard plastic cases less expensive hardware costly units works quit well . Danelectro offers expensive units I n't think sound much better , hardware better , view ! ! ! . You ca n't go wrong product , Danelectro around years makes great product ... I six Danelectro effects pedals work great ... This pedal remarkable useful tones . The sound may everyone , already Boogie really metal like distortion . I needed something different still usable , I feel pedal fills bill . The low price tag n't hurt feelings either . This win-win buying decision far I concerned . The FAB overdrive pedal work well . In fairness product , I aware reviews gives varying results based guitar amp . I Epiphone Les Paul Special II , Fender Frontman 25R amp . No matter I adjust , muddy sound . I 've heard used higher end guitars amps good results . I took chance based low cost , I plan upgrades guitar . The guitar new , strings came . I plan get better grade immediately , may I need get expected sound . There several reviews product You Tube . You search , hear capable . 
374	I n't know I would without little shelf music stand . I works sold-shelf stand , holds swab & even occasionally small speaker set I phone . It easily slides lip music stand reasonably secure . Very well worth $ $ . The plastic pretty lightweight , big help . I keep various guitar picks , clips , pencils , etc . kept falling I set front music . Glad I bought . I using Musician 's Gear music stand . The shelf fits , moves easily moving stuff shelf stand . It made plastic flexes fairly easily n't feel sturdy metal shelf stand . There n't options though unless know one metal . It good thing cost lot . This shelf convenient often used would think come every music stand . It slips lower shelf creates smaller shelf pencils , pens , clip tuners , capos , etc . It pays cluttering book shelf items go spilling floor every time adjust book turn page . I love pen , capo , tuner clipped top lip shelf serve keep pages firmly place book & # 34 ; trained & # 34 ; stay place . A must , five star item . plastic bracing . Due design , attach stands turned lip shelf ( quality stands ) . I used sticky tape -- problem solved . Gives place stow guitar picks , tuner , capo pencil , invaluable accessory . Worth 6 bucks , aware may improvise comes attaching stand ! 
375	It works , works well . It easily cuts guitar strings , ukulele strings , etc . No damage blades cutting heavy light gauge steel strings . If change strings , cutter must . It durable , material made high quality metal , makes clean cuts . The rubber grips comfortable use , red accents ( therefore easy find ) .My minor gripe spring-loaded open . I 've cut blades reaching pocket times I first got . Thankfully I n't change strings often . I also made little leather pouch clipper end , I put rubber band around handles keep must-have bag . Highly recommended . As case tools , really get pay string cutter . It 's extremely well-built , performs task well.Pros : - Extremely high quality Comfortable rubber Red accent handle makes easy find Effortlessly cuts even stainless steel bass stringsCons : - Has ability lock cutter closed storage ; tool spring-loaded open . While may plus people , I find less , extremely well-made tool guitar kit . If 're bassist likes stainless steel strings , 'll appreciate cut like butter . This cuts strings problems . It n't take lot pressure squeeze handles n't damage cutting blades like wire recommended frequent string changes . Good cutter guitar strings take care electrical wire sizes . comfortable . While simple string cutter ( something one buy anywhere ) , made well excellent quality . Anyone changing strings guitar needs one tool . It easy hold good product . At first seemed stupid buy wire cutters guitar strings , work extremely well . They seem high quality easily clip guitar strings right tuner post.I agree user pointed fact 're spring loaded open mechanism keep closed . That make storing little akward , , I think best product change strings.PS - If using scissors clip strings ends , crazy - buy things ... 
376	I 've owned several multi-effect pedals past , even one Digitech . Up til , one thing common : layers menus click thru make changes adjustments . It pain . Then I saw one ... ! I lot research , torn RP255 . I decided go cheap got RP255 . So far , OK decision . The RP255 plenty features , good compromise menus knobs . I recommend reviewing manual first day two sum device quickly , RP255 probably capable generating sound effect want , may need work . As many multi-effect pedals , selection ( 60 ) factory tone/effect profiles , save trouble programming new ones . These 60 `` user-defined '' profiles , identical factory presets . The difference # , modified user , left . The factory presets , # , . So , really experiment different setups without worrying losing came factory . You also `` reset '' entire device want , lose addition different tones effects unit offer , also two additional features useful : ( pretty basic ) drum machine 20 second looper . The looper really I bought pedal . It 's easy use , overdubs . I wish Digitech would made 40 60 second looper . 20 seconds really n't much . FYI , use drummer looper time . No biggie , 's good , I disappointed unit ? Pretty simple . I 'm older guy , playing approximately 50 years . I 've played every kind music , I would appreciated much broader selection presets . This may slight , seems like 95 % presets sort ( obnoxious ) distortion . Come guys , customers 13 years old ! I expect professional piece equipment offer variety professional choices . Now , I 'm working presets . I 'm back programming menus , ugh ! .So 's . It 's solid piece equipment , many tone presets choose . In honesty , I aware , I would probably gotten unit , good design quality . For $ 120 get virtually every effect works wellAbility adjust presets sounds great - especially reverb . When spring reverb used '65 Fender Twin amp model get really great sounding drip , much better 'd expect . Delay chorus also pretty presets overdrives pretty meh . Nothing good even DS-1 pedal . Nothing good solid state amp overdrive . And nothing universe good tube permanent preset . In words , 'd great clean channel could double tap preset . No dice , program sound multiple preset slots . That makes seems like lot ( 60 slots ) get filled pretty end , 's definitely worth $ 120 I spent . I recommend 're market one . Not best pedal , price ... 's pretty freakin ' awesome ! Love 20 second looper ability turn wah depressing volume pedal way forward . Solid sounds cabinets ! So problem reviews people generally review things soon get still phase . I 've used jam lab 4 years use every time I play electric ( 5-7 hours week . ) The unit held well . No problems case pedals . All switches , knobs , plugs , & display work fine . It n't on/off switch 's minor . It 's low profile easy switch foot . I going mixer works fine . No feedback buzz it.I like recording software , Cubase , came . I n't think I 'd use much I . It 's fun easy record songs . Cubase little quirky often tell error needs close , I 've learned nothing happens 's fine.I n't use looper much I Digitech Jam Man . Which , n't , need ! The drum presets fun use . It 's blast set drum track , loop rhythm , jam top . Is n't 's ? My two gripes tuner clean presets . The tuner accurate I use cheapo tuner works much better . Also tuner supposed silent n't . Some flaw I guess . Also clean presets ; like acoustic clean bright sound cheap weak . I n't like . The distortion presets awesome tube overdrive massive fuzztone . They rock . I use alot ones well.IMHO `` must '' addition set . It 's professional use ... I turn pro I 'll get something better . I gave two stars expression pedal stopped working second day , visually 's hard read lettering small . Also many function one knob , little confusion . The sounds great recording aspect nice , something best needs.I looking Boss instead , Any product make player like sound like pro sound investment . The RP255 amazing processor loaded features ( looper , drum machine , tuner ) dozens cool pre-sets ( `` '' favorite ) . You customize sounds I still n't gotten tired Digitech 's choices . The AC adaptor ( included ) allows hours rockin ' fun . I live , headphone jack essential . I run iPod unit play along favorite tunes - sweet ! The control settings little daunting first , owner 's manual walk tough stuff . Bottom line : great toy . Unit sturdy . Lots good presets capabilities . Works X-Edit software . That gets confusing bit unit displays one thing , computer screen another . I n't mastered yet month knocking settling sounds acceptable far ideal . I 've see much easier software puts effects screen stomp box graphics build sound . With X-Edit call sound start changing . The interface match RP lot provisions . The thing , get bit overwhelming , least . I got Christmas would shop around lot . Perhaps I wind choosing far , eh . For one thing , plugging headphones , output n't loud I 'd like . I kinda demands output another want play loud . 
377	Some complaints well warranted cheap unit . First I fumble around almost 15 minutes get open straight seems like I got previously-returned unit customer must bent arms wrong way along joints I careful I could tell would break bent wrong way much force . I give I felt bad return I didnt want make Amazon lose money weird shaped box probably costs $ 8 postage send back them.But eventually I figured . I 5 ft 10 inches tall man stand tall enough I opened way still inch 2 spare I wanted raise maximum . Looks like complaining height realize 3 segments stretched reveal full height ( They probably raised 2 3 segments ) .So price I think get pay since I want stand stay bedroom home I think unit suffice plan travel around getting kid 18 years old I recommend buy sturdier unit probably break short order . And fifteen bucks plus buy new one.The truth flimsy piece junk , okay responsible adult treat great care ( ) children drunks , fragile easy break . I took advice tightened adjustment knobs height finger tight without great force previous reviewers attest easy strip bolt over-tighten , careful.I keep mine I purchase second unit I would buy one I dont like flimsy junk I feel even large dog could knock break dang thing . I bought replace folding stand strong enough hold weight guitar books . This stand works great , hold even largest music tab construction much better portable stands I 've used past , two great features I really appreciate . One 's height adjustable , two tilting head . The tilting head real portable stnad , one works great.For price stand great buy I would recommend anyone , primarily guitarist stand . With page holders tilting head height adjustability one best stand purchases guitarist make . Of course , stand nearly solid feeling , solid-metal music stand I use home . It twist around bit handle . On hand , 's much lighter , collapsible , goes inside practice bag instead piece furniture takes another hand lug . For practices rehearsals I want travel light . This stand fits bill , desk angle adjustable works well large fake books single lead sheet . I two pieces thin plexiglass cut local hardware store sandwich separate sheets music I problems wind three-sheet-wide scores . I 've never sturdiness problem stand , I 've never tip , I careful tighten knobs necessary , I set legs sturdiest position . I always play sitting , height consideration . But I measured found highest bottom sheet music 50 '' floor . That 's plenty high even I vocalist , I 'm 6 ' 1 '' . Sure , impress would $ $ 100 , stand quality almost unbelievable $ 13 . I notice negative reviews two three years old , I wonder stand design . It IS lightweight stand I take care knobs , I certainly would call might important : The stand delivered month ( October 2011 ) NOT `` two section '' stand , advertised . It 's one section collapses 20 '' length fits practice bag . I actually consider plus since makes quicker easier erect rehearsals . I bought one Signature stands years back , 've changed bit . That one definitely two sections , I made top section excellent table-top book stand . That older one also clamps section instead turn-knob-screw-in type clamps . It may challenge assemble it.I personally found challenge assemble I wired.I 'good ' putting things together without product get : ) As newbie violin student I needed music stand . Having purchased many things Amazon.com , I learned trust customer reviews get posted ( remembering always cranks ) . This music stand got good reviews I say I happy . I would recommend purchase one . This stand little difficult open . The top gets stuck turned wrong way . Other stand collapses small black bag came .

You use standard eye-glass cleaning cloth ( 2 quid ) instead buying cloth ( 5 quid ) , imo . You could also use eye-glass cleaning solution instead ( I past ) special solution works better wood laminate surface guitars - eye-glasses ( smiles ) . This really shine wood quite well . I recommend . 
379	I one gig bag already ( like Fender ) , wanted another gig bag third guitar I bought . This Fender lots better bag . My bag storage pockets broad bottom part nice storage pockets neck like Fender bag . The Finder 's padding bit better bag also , , course , neither good hard case.I prosthesis right leg . I need back pack straps back gig back help transport guitar , I use require hands . The Fender 's straps great . The left strap gig bag would often work shoulder guitar would hang became difficult carry . The straps Fender stay put - love it.The guitar I tote bag Martin HD-28 . But , also Blueridge BR-180 Seagull S6 Coastal Spruce . Either three acoustic guitars fit Fender gig bag I said , great gig bag . If I ever need another , I 'll getting another Fender gig bag . Really impressed gig bag . My beloved Jasmine fits perfectly inside , nice padding , tons pockets store stuff , backpack straps handle easy carrying , looks FAB ! Love price . Ca n't go wrong one . I Guitar Center looking right gig bag recently purchased Ibanez Acoustic Guitar , virtually identical theIbanez Exotic Woods Series Acoustic Electric Guitar , everything stock bit small ...

380	A good solid piece equipment ! It sounds good looks absolutely beautiful ! The description listed slight wear marks back , I really look hard find ( one ) . It came well packed brand-new guitar looks like one ! Tone control n't work returned . But pretty nice even though I felt fret-board quality higher 900 Gibson Les Paul expect . If I order I would pay 140 get SG 400 quality pickups . The sound let 's say ... average . Good beginner guitar , guitar upgraded new pickups . The bolt-in neck n't bother SG 400 n't another reason I would step next time . Shape ok. subjective . I like solid Les Paul shape little better since 's conservative . But size good almost comfortable Les Paul style . Ca n't believe make good guitar like 160 bucks . Also , even though I tempted faded finish , glossy finish really nice . This guitar make player proud . For money ca n't find better deal . I currently overseas n't want bring good guitar along . This great playing guitar money , comes packaged extremely well high quality around price . I bought Guitar Center wish I n't . The reason I said I would rather saved taxes , oh well . Now guitar ... second three Epiphone guitars someone n't professional musician , I still want sound like one . The sound SG true big brother Gibson . Awesome crunch great sustainability . I take leave kill pot . The electronics , mainly switch could use replacing . I 'm complaining , I noticed extra noise switching For $ 169 , ca n't expect top sum , I love guitar . I keep E flat tuning stays . To , guitar sound crunch deserves drop 's tuning little . love thing ! ! ! action perfect , great sound , good feel , easy play highly recomend 
381	I Fostex PM0.5 MKII BX5a Deluxe . While BX5a tends get higher review rating popular , I personally prefer PM0.5 due bass & volume . Both models cost , PM0.5 roughly $ 20 PM0.5 bigger , heavier , heat sink back , combo jack . While BX5a bigger tweeter , separate XLR & TRS jacks . , well-made . If plan share monitor 2 difference sources , separate input BX5a convenient ( always get support 2 inputs PM0.5 ) .The BX5a clarity & boosted details , tinny side . The PM0.5 boom less treble . I guess difference due size tweeter length bass port ( BX5a larger tweeter & 1 rear bass port , PM0.5 2 front bass ports ) . Sounds coming PM0.5 resemble ambience car & home stereo purpose , I like warmer sound PM0.5 . I use watch movie , PM0.5 suitable main speakers , BX5a better placed surround speakers.For references , I placed audio samples song I wrote & arranged ( wo n't copyright violation issue ) , re-recorded AKG condenser mic , placed height tweeter , . Hope 'll help making choice easier ( instead buy like I : ) [ ... ] These speakers worked great 14 months . Last week ( ) , one would n't power way . The problem getting worse every time I try use , 's matter time stops working . It seems problem capacitors I read reviews . I took chance monitors anyway , huge mistake . I use 2 4 hours per week . I contacted M-Audio 's online support system given addresses two electronics repair shops . One East coast one west coast . I 've since found many complaints issue Internet M-Audio support site . M-Audio n't stand behind products , I 'll never purchase anything . I 've used reg year . Obviously better sounding monitors , really great pay 'd recommend someone trying save years continued regular use . sound good year ago . My old pair JBL Studio Pro computer monitors finally gave ghost . At time , mid 1990 's , best could expect computer monitors . I mixing voice overs , I needed real deal . After extensive research listening , I decided M-Audio BX5a deluxe . For price beat ! Punchy crisp bass , smooth highs great mid range . They also accurate , I hear things way recorded . They also bring light subtleties old CD 's I never heard ! Also wood construction , gives speakers warmer resonance others made plastic metal . If studio budget , need best speakers $ , buy . Remember , studio monitors , audio going directional , use monitors . Great speakers portables , like Ipod . One note , need really good sound card get babies ! I bought solution obtain feedback recording guitar computer . That solution successful . These speakers put enough power I maintain clarity guitar tone fairly well achieve feedback almost easily amp . I amp powers 12 '' celestion speaker . These monitors powering 5 '' Woofer 1 '' , respectively . Slight drop power output , beefy enough I n't really isolation pads come paper thin , almost pointless . If really need , get substantial pads . The back panels get kind hot hours ... really concerned , 's worth great sound , excellent low end , lots clarity throughout . They pricey , priced pretty reasonably amazon . I would really recommend going retailer ... even sale expensive store online . Only go store hear compare monitors . On plus side , monitors look feel amazing . They coated kind silky rubberized stuff heavy look n't sound horrible . I mean , computer speakers anything . The sound forward , I would say harsh . That 's uncommon among studio monitors . There definitely lot clarity . Not ton bass , 's pretty much understood monitors woofers size . There 's schools thought studio monitors . Some people think basically bringing warts music , others think sound like normal speaker . These pleasing people interested first . I definitely sounds like music right face listening . Any flaws would quite previously used KRK 's I compare . Granted , larger expensive , although also budget monitors . I liked better . They clear also sounded nicer , course , much bass.I going put woofer burn ... see I could improve situation ... BUT one speakers starts buzz 5 minutes 's turned . The buzz increases volume time . I tried moving different location , turning volume , even disconnecting audio feed ( plugged power ) . Nothing stopped buzz . If warmed turn , buzz starts like 10 20 seconds . So I sent back . I n't really impressed sound I 'm definitely satisfied quality control , I 'm going try larger expensive monitors instead . Maybe Behringer 's something . I think 's worth extra 200 dollars get full-sized monitor . Sound nice , unreliable BX5a Deluxe.I pair NS 10s , currently working without problems 10 years use.2 years ago I purchased set regular BX5a 's , lasted 1 1/2 years , faulty capacitors replaced BX5a Deluxe model , one week . one amps longer power up.I need pair affordable AV shielded monitors I depend , Cheap M-Audio Monitors it.I back using 's slight AV noise I find decent AV shielded much better company Avid took ! 
382	These best strap locks opinion , good quality , easy install remove , secure , look good . All guitars locks I 'm satisfied . In particular , I favor Dual Design . Why ? If need arises , 's possible use regular strap n't button locks installed . I two black ones 7 string Ibanez , Laguna guitars . I spare straps guitars , sometimes I lock spares plastic Dunlop discs.I older bass guitars similar Dunlop locks ( standard version ) , two locks installed mid 1990 's , one gold DD . All three held issues . I n't need re-tighten screws guitars two years ago . Then , I n't tour around world like metal stalwarts known ... . ; ) So I bought Dunlop , I trust brand . I dont even mind sorta big bulky . The problem I , scare piss . Its `` tighten washer nut '' situation ive normally seen strap locks . These pegs insert . Its hard trust , I always 1 hand gripped firmly guitar even adjusting amp I guitar . So scared little metal balls things slip , peg fall ruin $ 500 guitar . I single problem system yet , I never hope I . But happens update . Good product far , would n't recommend . There much crap world worried , strap locks shouldnt one things . The screws long thin bodied Gibson SG Classic . I find shorter screws fall pin straplock work either -- heads believe I used Gibson Les Paul Custom years ago , worked perfectly . Not newer SG though -- least new screws comes with.Fender Start appears take system well -- time tell . yes , willing swap strap locks originals work fine ... problem drilling new holes guitars ... explained size bit use wasnt big problem ... tried drill guitars fit without drilling luck ... good price welll made.. best strap locks ive ever used , dunlop always great products.easy install highly recomend bass player Almost dropped bass floor couple days got bad boys . When I put I felt confident I would n't issue anymore . It 's easier strap quick release tab . This every 's best friend .

The schaller ones ( see ) major flaw family 's experience . We never run anything design going n't work Schaller Design : Our family 2 guitarists 1 bassist using locks . Every one us continual problems locks periodically unscrewing guitar body . I one back gig damage brand new 60th Anniversary American P-Bass ... good . My son one come middle gig last weekend . The problem design 's ton friction top bottom pieces lock results tab 's screwed body unscrewing . We 've tried applying bar soap , petro jelly , spray based dry lubricant ... . none prevented ultimate forces cause phenomenon.We tried make Shallers work could . Maybe 're active stage tolerate equipment damage performance distruptions caused us . Straplocks around long time , You use instrument regular strap well , This dual design sold install guitar . A little difficult getting lock mechanism installed strap , still took ten minutes . The added security knowing 1200 dollar bass n't going hit floor makes well worth small cost I never owned Straplock system prior owning Dunlops , boy I amazed ! Every straplock system I 've used past , friends ' guitars , semi-permanently mounted strap guitar - often extra ties manner things made impractical detach strap whim . In contrast , locks mechanism make trivially easy pop strap - 's great ! Better still , hardware fit almost perfectly existing screw holes , making installation trivial . And new posts close size shape old ones I think I could slap strap onto guitar pinch , using posts like OEM ones . This great system , I would highly recommend anyone uses strap electric guitar . I use basses job quite well.. They easy install bass strap . These came stock Jackson . All guitars I Schaller buttons I one main strap I use guitars . I figured since guitar came I would try . Not twenty min later I removing putting Schaller buttons place . Here 3 major reasons I like . They stick far guitar strap button back stomach ! 2- Problems engaging . I would push receiver pop back . It n't I forced pushing button went stayed . Schallers click know ready Cheap . They feel cheap . Thin metal used comparison Schallers ; heavy solid feel them.For bucks I 'll stick Schaller 's . I using 10+ years never seen one fail . I 've using Straploks guitars past 10+ years . I one fail ever . Just sure tug put strap make sure 's right . I 've struggled C clip past , going ? It 's one time thing first install , 's biggie . I disappointed quality engineering product . A work-around main issue follows review . The flaws bother order significance are:1 ) Quality : Very weak soft-metal screws . Using minimal force well aligned driver damage screw-heads 4 I worked . 2 rounded much I afraid would hard remove later , causing run hardware store higher quality replacement screws.2 ) Engineering : The instructions recommend , screws ( ones come straplocks ) designed # 2 Phillips screwdriver . However , standard # 2 driver big fit strap-buttons . So likely choose grinding screwdriver fit , using # 1 increase impact first problem since wrong tool ) Engineering : The point connection strap inch guitar . The strap button radius inch . Therefore lateral stress ( i.e . weight guitar ) 3x due leverage pulling outward screw . A 9 pound guitar would applying constant 27 30 pounds force screw wood around ( half weight evenly two strap buttons course ) . Get little active stage level force could go way , screws n't total crap , might 3 4 star review . Once deal fact normal screwdriver wo n't fit get things properly installed , would probably work people . So stuck set , 's I recommend : Go hardware store buy # 6 x 1 '' stainless steel replacement screws . Note wo n't fit properly , closest match modified . ( They 21 cents local stores , would cost Dunlop maybe 10 cents bulk paid crap screws come . ) Put screw electric drill ( pointy end ) screw head rotating smoothly operate drill . Run drill using file belt sander take fraction diameter screw head . It n't need much . I used belt sander took 20 seconds . While , file cheap # 2 screwdriver fit strap new screws normal , recommend friends try different brand ! The first thing I noticed design far guitar 's surface strap actually connected . What tells considerable added stress screw wood surrounding added leverage guitar 's weight . The & # 34 ; & # 34 ; surface wood , makes sense , I ca n't help wonder could eventually ( eventually much time use ) cause cracks splits result.I found someone selling Dunlop strap buttons , great idea someone 2 main straps several guitars , order I found Planet Waves Elliptical End Pins . I think best idea yet keeping guitar strap , unless 're going spinning guitar around shoulders , additional stress guitar 's body . I 've ordered set . Sorry , I n't like 're big . They stand much . They work 're effective pronounced . There many good alternatives ; strap gaskets , strap locks , undoing pin putting straight guitar strap . Again , work , 're aesthetic elegant . I also got gold set bass looks like I wearing big purple platforms I play . Not cool . I like straplocks , little tight get Levy 's strap . I manage get . However , I found easier buy strap guitar . Quick snap . Sturdy . If convenient , wo n't used . In case , convenient easy use , hence , prized guitar drop floor accident . Well worth money spent ! I agree another reviewer included screws strip much easy . I purchased set strap locks years ago , I dont recall issue , I 'm thinking Dunlop changed screws point . I luckily able get screws muscle , locks secure . However , due issue , I 'm considering alternatives another guitar mine could use strap locks . I hope Dunlop fixes issue soon . The Dunlop Dual Design Straplock System sturdy , fairly alternative guitar straps slipping instruments . The screws used attach Straplok guitar heavy gauge pretty large -- 's little chance going come . The locking mechanism seems like secure require little maintenance .

383	I picked Pod HD500 I love . Of course couple days later announced HD500x , n't look like 've made major changes . Anyway , 're thinking getting one , thoughts , particular order : thing versatile . You use number different ways . Just effects board 8 customized effects , effects amp sims , midi controller , recording interface , name 6 gave access guts . Everything tweakable , , flexible . They trust users read freaking manual . I 'm amazed much customize thing suit needs . Want foot pedal control feedback level delay ? No problemo ! live performance , thing would perfect . It allows organize presets `` Set '' name everything whatever want . You change banks patches easily change patches . *While effects cup tea ( particular , distortions sound harsh ear ) enough options make anyone happy . For example , I love distortion I get tube compressor drive turned . *The built looper goes forward , backward , half speed , effects , effects . Fantastic ! * It 's built like tank . Metal exterior , everything feels solid like last longer I willIf 've got cash need solid array effects live performance , take look new version . Just buying handful actual pedals simulates ( mention amps ) would cost money , assuming could even find vintage ones . Truly great piece gear ! I 've several PODs never really impressed tone . Right box , HD 500 totally blew away . I know marketing calls `` HD '' added tonal characteristics , 's true - huge difference HD series older PODs . I ca n't really say sound better , ears amp models sound significantly better older PODs without much tweaking NO EQing ( although one tweak tone several EQs ) .One complaint older PODs ( I agree ) one could never seem get great high gain tone . This case HD 500 . I 've able get great high gain tones without much work.At first , I purchased theLine 6 POD HD I n't see value HD 500 . After thinking , I decided pick HD 500 compare two pedals . I definitely think HD 500 worth extra cash , even hobbyist . There extra controls looper , extra record time . The wah pedal seems better constructed 500s ( I could wrong , I DO remember different ) . The dual tone feature flexible routing options HD 500 amazing . I 'm sure I 'm forgetting differences , I know I 'm happy I went HD 500 HD drivers seem work great Windows 7 Pro 64-bit Mac OS ( 64-bit Mac drivers ) . The included software OK - I get feeling still building . It 's bit seems work OK part . The software updater works great I 've already couple firmware updates since I purchased HD 500 ( bug fixes ) . There also much anticipated firmware upgrade coming end month add six amp models several adjustable parameters supposed really help dial correct `` tube amp feel behavior '' .I nearly purchased M13 plug myFender Super Champ XD Electric Guitar Amplifier , I noticed HD 500 number effects PLUS amp modelling price ! I know two pedals designed different purposes , HD 500 made much sense . I use practice headphones , plug amp effects pedal . To use effects pedal , one need disable amp modeling set output mode match appropriate amp setup . I also decided test playing HD 500 directly aBehringer Eurolive Active PA Speaker System Woofer Compression Driver , may replace amps primary rig ( I get Behringer today , 'll see ) .The build quality POD X3 Live improved . The case entirely metal vs. combination metal plastic . I definitely see heavy road/gig worthy . I also purchased Compact Keyboard Gig Bag , fits HD 500 ( albeit snugly ) .Overall I 'm happy setup , recommend amp pedal anyone looking practice home ( especially headphones ) wide variety musical styles . I love HD500 . Got back started explore 's capabilities . Sounds good happy fact additional tones downloaded website . There many options , I spend hours experimenting trying different things . The possibilities endless . Wonderful . I love . Am sure . ENJOY ! ! ! The Line 6 POD HD500 too-much compression even compression effect turned . If want guitar sound like Eddie Van Halen , Joe Satriani guitarists studio album guitar sound , I recommend getting BOSS GT-10 installing BOSS GT-10 Patches James Limborg . Search Google BOSS GT-10 Patches James Limborg . Before get started , I `` pro '' amateur . I work church use work . But I hesitate say I 'm `` pro '' , `` amateur '' means something purely love ... I feel way music ... So ... First ... models I 've tested far away realistic ears modelers I 've used , includes Logic Studio 's amps ( sound almost good btw ) , POD X3Live ( HD models noticeably better ... fizz GONE GONE GONE ) , original POD 2.0 ( sounded made happy time ) , ToneLab SE ( I missed , anymore ) .I made patches one guitars based Bassman 4x10 alongside Dr. Z , coolest sound I 've ever made guitar ... easily . Better sounding , ears , real amps I 've using ( maybe I put stage n't run loud ) . I sound unit.Oh , always ... forget pre-sets . They 're probably useless imagine might bad news . And 's significant ... ... First , editing clunky like XT X3Live . Just forget trying use display . Connect computer ... Seriously . When start patch , get lucky , seems , manage coax `` two amp '' config ... Next , The functionality unit exaggerated 's specs . You almost certainly NOT able 8 FX way 're thinking . Why ? Let 's say use XT X3 . think 're used to.You start 8 effect banks ... volume pedal ( need use effect bank ) . You might able use analog pedal , I like volume compressor ... I loop I guess ... 2 . FX loop ( works effect bank ... Line6 , way make always active firmware upgrade ? Seems like ) 3 . Noise Gate ( used always available ... n't worry mix M13 I plan , though , M13 great gate ) . I mostly use clean barely amps , I might able skip this.4 . Wah ( always available active X3 ) .5 . . The X3Live final EQ final output I liked lot . addition FX , . You need dedicate FX bank ... might left . For , put clean boost tube drive ( I think sound better box M13 . Probably 're `` digitally part signal '' I think ) verb amp . No slots left . What need delay modulation ? ! I re-think way I use FX box . Still evaluating work 're guy like using X3Live ( occasionally ) solution guitar . ( All guitars piezo bridges . ) No use acoustic preamp . No matter . I one . I probably dedicate `` '' amp bring signal unit mix addition , n't many routing options X3Live , ability switch two FX chains one patch ( instead switching programs ) gone . As far back old Vox ToneLab SE , I could literally switch channels one amp/cab another FX chain . You could something similar X3Live . Not . Also ... Line 6 , earth ca n't make Midi work USB Midi interface unit ? How complicated really ? In short ... X3Live significantly ... flexibility imho unit , many us least , ought discontinued imho . For , 's still viable also still might need FX ! I thought might possible unit , even I needed use Stomp acoustic side ( I 'm happy ) would bump M13 stage . It first , , I indeed get rid M13 , n't miss it.. That said , I think I 'm hearing FX ( especially dirt pedals ) work FAR better inside box M13 connect POD favorite patches far I 've made ( use Bassman model Dr. Z model ... far AWAY favorite amp model ! ) n't leave room modulation special FX . ( I 'm `` switch whole patches fly '' guy . I turn FX . ) But bit tweaking , I discovered sounds , I n't need dual amp chains often , I flexibility back ... So I complaining limitations ? No . Because sound unit extraordinary . I 'd take full star shortcoming , fact unit sounds good enough I ca n't it.There , point , I hope , technology possibly address usability shortcomings , I say , price , I totally satisfied sound ! In meantime , I willing trade flexibility former rig sound one ? Heck yes , sounds good . I even love models amps I know I 'll never use first time ever ... . And months experimenting , I able make patches completely worked two-voice guitar stuff ... NO additional outboard gear I n't want . So I 've simplified I wanted , longer feel like I 'm really compromising ... started rig consisting HD500 , sometimes M13 , acoustic preamp ( currently Yamaha ) mixed HD signal aux input . I 've gotten point I everything I want , I need , without additional pedals , I sold M13 . I kept analog pedals I like , rarely take house anymore.I 'm know trade-offs . For I , basically M13 form function handful amp models shoved box , close 're probably going come . And , I mention ... SOUND ! It 's seriously great ! UPDATE ! I learned I indeed problem replacing M13 well , sold . I thought I 'd miss , I ! As February 2012 , I supplemented product black James Variax ( Korean ) , 's marriage made heaven ! If going go product , looking new guitar , check new . Totally amazing . You 'll see much controversy device read line 6 forum . My opinion `` I Love '' . I play guitar privately ( live public ) I complaints . I still use time learn something new everyday . For usable tones playing live , best bet plug tube power amp . Direct mixer running solid state amp uninspiring.I n't like recorded tones either , much rather preferred Amplitube 3 micing real tube amp n't said , good practice song writing . Used year finally sold ! That 's thing items like , lose value real quick next version comes . 
384	Overall pretty good stand . It sturdy good adjustable heights . A good value lots stuff need hang . I took one star bottom part kind awkward fro holding guitar guitar strap peg bottom thing touching bottom stand make sit easy fall I 've fall number times . I 'm thinking could designed bottom wider . Also edges guitars always touching enough room stand . I got mine I gave try , . It looks really good , sturdy well . Is super stable , I tried : 2 Strats electro acoustic , removed one Strat placed another acoustic ( 12 string time ) . I pushed stand ... . It holds . As guitar hanging secured top believe really difficult guitar/bass whatever put falls . You set height , always considering guitars n't reach ... ... . Totally recommended ! Oh Man , My Guitars new home , love stand , looks nice works excellent , currently I Strat Style guitar bass Epi Les Paul hanging baby , even one guitar holds fine , No unsteadiness , wiggling , Big space saver , definitely Good Pick , Great home use road , folds nicely , great padding heads body supports , 10 10 one . For stand well built , hard assemble pretty much brainer great price . They n't touch floor . There safety straps hold 3 acoustic guitars ( Fender , Ibanez anybody 's guess antique ) place without difficulty , I n't worry knocking . It takes little space , biggest plus ! Stringed instruments best hung vertically , stand accomplishes beautifully . Constructed durable material making wise investment . Do n't buy Chinese piece crap really need three guitar stand . It barely workable two.It easy set , way neck brackets arranged going get two guitars comfortably even guitars still slip stand even tighten little rubber thingies top hold neck place . And absolutely keep tight guitar point turn sideways fall best thing stands built V Type guitars Jackson Rhoads long put back back . For Les Paul Strat type axes , rounded lower bout curvatures make prone slipping narrow , stick like feet stand , especially new . You ca n't tilt feet try lend stability way guitars hang feet wo n't support enough weight make possible . So thing utterly fails three guitar stand . If got ta buy something On Stage , get double hang separation instruments ends better balanced . But really , pass entirely either triple hang double definitely case one gets one pays .

I worried would damage Attachment Bar , quite heavy general , 's strong enough hold typical stage mic small boom arm . This unique piece slips tube Mixer Rack Piano scissor stand . The square nut design tight tightening tube rough cut threading . The MIC end mount works pretty good . Overall problems I found Up tube could 1 ' 1 1/2 ' taller threads could buffed manufacturer . 
388	I extremely pleased amp . I purchased I looking tube practice amp fit bill . The numerous voicings setting little gem make worth far asking price . Even though low wattage amp , sucker get LOUD . The reviews detail exact specs much better I could , I that.However , little amp packs big punch comes tone . I highly recommend ! The Fender Vibro Champ great little amp . I 'm amazed good amp sounds . A small light weight package good set voices outputs decent amount sound.This 5 Watt Tube amp enough power fill medium sized room perfect practice amp . This much better louder amp small $ 100 solid state starter / practice amps major manufacturers . Fender uses two standard tubes pre- amplification : 12AX7 6V6 ( Fender branded tubes ) . These nice clean tubes react amp takes 15 seconds warm draws 45 cool part amp 16 voice settings . In reality amp packs effects 7 different amps , Tweed , Blackface , British , Hot Rod , Metal , Jazz , Acoustic . The first five three different levels style . Our two amps Marshalls , acoustic half stack . If I 'm really honest , I like sound amp lot half stack . This clean simple amp use . The Marshall ton tweaks hard get exactly right.The volume level different voices nowhere near matched . Some voices incredibly loud , others really quiet . Switching voices means moving volume knob lot . Sadly , volume goes voice selected , 5 effects settings possible two three level ( Vibratone , Delay , Reverb , Chorus , Tremolo ) . The F/X level knob adjusts amount effect applied ( set 1 , effect n't used ) . This probably least useful part amp . There pedal selection , effect selected volume dialed , 're kind stuck fiddle amp . There 's easy way change effect middle song.There gain knob.I like speaker amp . It nicely detailed good warm sound . The internal speaker connected 1/4 inch jack , possible connect amp another cabinet simple 1/4 inch speaker cable . Very nicely done Fender , cheaper amps hard wired speaker . The back panel also 1/4 inch jack Line great small gig practice amp . The sound outstanding . The amp used Gibson Lucille 2008 Les Paul Standard Plus . Bought supplement amps ( record blues tones ) . I first saw big box musician 's store `` blues guitar session '' going public jam session open anyone . They lot tube Fender amps plugged . I surprised I plugged amp away group , turned , started playing ... It sounded good amps . The two employees worked two customers could n't believe sound coming ... even players checked . I n't understand Fender managed keep amp secret long ... poor marketing maybe ? I n't know , want blues blues-rock amp great vintage tones , check . Pick used sound like tube amp , essentially , . The amp sounds big warm tubes , thin tin-like . Has GREAT overdriven tweed , blackface , bassman models . A couple Marshall settings n't bad either . This amp sounds better Super Champ ears ( tried store well ) makes sense since 's class A amp opposed class B ... warmer speaker decent amp also sounds great using external speaker home jamming recording blues without driving everyone nuts , amp God-send . Check one 'll want . Small . Light weight . Stunning Fender Blackface looks . Warm tube power amp smooth responsive . The digital voicing direct easy set . The fact Fender discontinued model shock . It one fine small amp begs used recording studio . The direct provideds simple easy way hook board signal recorder/mixer still give amp 's skeaker monitor . What could easier ? And mikes well , way . The choice there.With LED display ( cost increase one ) plain use volume tone mixed drive , 's simple dial great tone makes playing fun , practicle . The voiceing models amp selection quite good true amp replecates . The Tweed , Blackface , Marshall voicing well done lend overall tone fine little reverb FX section . The spring reverb well done I bumped amp looking `` spring '' known amps real spring reverb . It 's good . Once , controls easy direct . Never issue simply select model dial little effort . Who cares doe n't floorboard dozens switches channel selection ? You want , go waste money Line 6 something . This Champ made one thing . To give best possible tone selection least amount money effort . I believe accomplished well.Again , shame Fender dropped model line products . The super model step power speaker size , also cost higher well . I 'm glad I got one Amazon . com I part amp . Been playing five decades I know I good instrument gear I n't . This model keeper sure . And I n't even like digital ! How 's endorsement ? It 's good ... . I got $ 150 dollars sale . I n't like 8 inch speakers gigging , unbelievably good sound going line PA . The 8 inch speaker okay practice , jack external cabinet . Be careful load put amp though . I 've using cheap amp long decided try tube amp . This thing gave first time I played wife staring open mouth I unboxed turned thinking first `` wasted money '' turned `` dang thing sounds good guess 's ok '' I begin shred p90 equipped les tons effects nice sound realistic , 5 watts think play ridiculously loud clear large living room small venue , though I n't think loud enough drummer . It line speaker great , amp nice build quality . Plus 's sale right snatch one 're gone . I would gig miked even record plug line right recording device . Note thing takes 15 seconds warm ca n't flip play instantly ( huge deal , turn get situated ) . I wish could crammed 10 inch speaker , though 8 inch sounds rather decent efficient . So stop thinking go buy !

390	I beginner guitar player . I Yamaha F335BL Hohner . I bought Yamaha years back , recently started really learning play . It sounds ok , great ( though Price pretty good ) It laminated , action pretty online I saw people really liked Seagull S6 Original sound price point . Boy right . I got guitar Guitar Center ( I tried ) The action low , fretboard bigger ( fingerstyle beginners really good ) . The sound also REALLY good , resonant , sounds & # 34 ; good & # 34 ; . It hard describe sound , woul hear it.I replace pins Tusq Pins , I could really tell difference sound , make look recommend guitars Seagull ( try , fun ) I 've playing 17 years . Most playing bluegrass band Columbus , My performance guitar Martin HD-28 practice guitar Blueridge wanted third guitar kicks . I 'd looking Taylors , n't want spend much Seagull S6 . A fellow picker asked I 'd ever heard Seagull - I n't - said nice guitars I ought check . So , I little research . I first read nice reviews S6 went YouTube listened . My guitar Seagull Coastline Spruce S6 I really like . I choose get cedar top version cedar soft , I understand spruce volume . I got S6 today evening wife , Taylor GS Mini , I , S6 , played Mountain . Nice , real nice guitar.I found action S6 pretty good box . I 'm going take luthier tomorrow install strap heel take look action time , make action better , I 'll let . I 'm also going put Elixir Light strings . I n't know kind strings , bottom line I happy playablilty action Seagull Coastline Spruce S6 acoustic guitar right box . I 'm glad I bought . This first time buying guitar without testing regrets.All positive reviews virtues excellent guitar model spot 're market , n't grand spend new acoustic guitar , get North American made wo n't regret . Seagull guitars intrigued years photos website , dealer anywhere near , I bought one sight-unseen Amazon , based good reviews . I 'm glad say I add voice chorus praise innovative traditionalist need time become accustomed unusual appearance construction . The narrow , reverse-taper headstock wide fingerboard give guitar look viewed vertically . Back sides cherry light stain , binding dark . The top natural dreadnoughts go , one comfortable play sitting . It appears based Martin , slightly rounder lower bout narrower upper bout . Weight pleasantly light , semi-gloss finish comfortable touch . Players broad fingers appreciate wide fingerboard , small hands consider `` '' Slim '' version , neck '' narrower really counts , however , Canadian dreadnought nothing ashamed . The maker good sense ship instrument high-quality , fresh strings , allowing new owner appreciate notable bass clear midrange soon tuned . Overall , falls within classic dreadnought tone category , good volume.Buying guitar online saves money leaves setup buyer . Both nut saddle guitar needed lowering , truss rod required adjustment ( hex wrench included ) . If experienced tasks , local luthier $ 30 so.Based sound , playability adjusted , construction quality , guitar definitely included comparing instruments price range . It real standout value.Update 8 2012 : The I play guitar , I love . It delivers balanced sound good dreadnought `` snap '' , action dialed , broad fingerboard relieves finger I n't fully realize hindered playing . I replacing Takamine Seagull equivalent . Although Amazon.com , I recently purchased Seagull S6 Original acoustic guitar . I compared variety brands price range , well Seagull Entourage acoustic-electric also general price range . The S6 nicely consistent tone , although maybe little bright players ' tastes , projects well . Some reviewers guitarists I 've talked wonder Seagull produce instruments sound well North America price . I think I found part answer I looked inside Seagulls . The look uniform neatly finished might guitars . Looking outside guitar listening , though , 'd never know . I find '' neck width nut great fingerpicking work fingering . It 's compromise standard acoustic neck width classical guitar neck width . For , works . Some players used traditionally narrow neck might appreciate attribute guitar . Seagull offer models , way , traditional width . The slightly shorter scale reminds scale Gibson uses many electric guitar models : shorter enough better enable chord fingering , short cause floppy strings . I could n't happier Seagull S6 , especially price ! I heard great things S6 , novice without idea buy , I bought based upon reviews . I 've played year , spending many hours guitar stores comparing guitars , ( humble ) thoughts : - The Seagull comparatively unattractive . Its snake-head headstock tiny , tuners looks place dreadnaught guitar.- The cedar top nice looking , rosewood mine The laminate sides/back seem much thicker competing guitars , makes guitar heavier , , less & # 34 ; alive & # 34 ; playing.- The satin-finished cedar top easy The cedar warm low mid strumming force , heavy strum , top seems bottom lose The treble sounds tinny bottom end seems The frets smaller competitors The binding sharp 90 degree angle without radius cuts chest arms playing - something I 've encountered I get action , low frets rattle - nice ! All , OK instrument stands simply 's made Canada Asian/Mexican prices - said , comes Canada n't mystical vibes . In fact , price range , I get Asian/Mexican guitar nicer laminate , spruce solid top wood , better tuners , attractive headstock - gloss finish durability sounds good.I n't regret getting , I feel like I overpaid I received , brand might great deal last decade 's exchange rates , I seen much better guitars shops price . Seagull reading ! I personally think Seagull rated . A lot reviewers covering muddy ( crisp ) sound & # 34 ; mellow & # 34 ; I n't think . I 115 guitars collection , around 15 nothing Seagull , Canada , bought one NEW rave reviews , recently ( I theS6 five years ) pulled S6 another try I could make believe sounded worse thanmy used Yamaha ; IT DID ! Side side I went chords guitar , finally come conclusion Seagull price tag $ S6 , $ 's Yamaha equal , , unless feel like throwing yourmoney away , I would stay away guitar , look , way , I S6 sale ! I bought guitar 2005 . It sounds looks wonderful manages stay way . I think good guitar think something might sound better would cost three four times much great guitar value.This model cedar top . I love sound vs typical spruce top flattop guitars . It bit mellow hint classical guitar tone . If prefer bright concert sound Martin 'll want cedar top.Yes guitar oiled finish . This allows soundboard really sing unimpeded . It also allows knock heck . thing five years n't much damage little arm wear . I think 'll like guitar enough knock around.The neck feels silky smooth . The frets well placed n't stab hanging neck little 'll get guitars price range . get frets filed additional expense competitors beware n't come case I bought hard shell brand name `` Canadian '' . Great I bought really n't need adjustment I took local shop make perfect . I 've also taken every year setting action - checking tweaking neck - getting frets polished . I also use humidifier case winter months Chicago . Performing tasks prolong life Seagull enjoyment it. -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- Update : update 2010 review . This guitar sounds even BETTER . I went handful guitar stores looking another acoustic `` fun '' I bucks burning hole pocket . To surprise guitars three times price sounded vastly inferior . You see I learned play good wood guitar time `` open '' keep sounding better . Yet another reason keep humidified taken care . It increase value ( least ) .

395	Solidly built works mic stand should..couldnt long I take care Ill never need buy new one . Works well needs . It adjusts holds whatever microphone I use position well . A good buy . I would recommend light moderate use . I used gig Monday ... 's solid , well built , nothing loose floppy , stands straight ( extending almost 7 feet tall ) , folds easily , nice compact folded ... good enough note , I ordered , I thinking I would able unscrew vertical section round heavy base ( also `` On Stage '' ) screw tripod ... 's case , vertical piece integral tripod base . I 'm unhappy though , stand works quite well . absolutely problems well built steady easy carry . I get another monitor . I bought , seems pretty sturdy . I would think would work even better mic . I use mount Stagg Small Musical Stand hold small format mixer gigs . It 's light weight sturdy . 
396	Eko Ranger 12 D'Addario light strings getting nice ringing tone good sustain . No issues like breaking dead strings I Elixir 's , good sound . Awesome quality strings ! Love em ! Just re-strung 12 string . It hassle I got done nicely . D'Addario one manufactures seem content making quality product reasonable price . Their string selections compare well pricer brands I yet find better buy . Good value I always love D'Addario strings 6 string guitars I decided order new 12 string Ovation 245 . They sound great . Of course guitar strings personal preference . Over years I experimenting various makes I always seem return . This mean I try others . I surely continue experiment . I one change strings guitars regular basis . I spend Summer Canada Florida I assure climate much Canada Florida . Strings guitars left behind Florida Summer deteriorate quickly even humidity controlled environment . I find D'Addario strings stay better condition others . Good strings These strings sound great far held tune well couple days stretching . I Luna 12 string sound rich . I would purchase .

398	I got Duet2 instead single-light version Kindle users . So far I really like , cuz really brightens screen makes easier read , even better day light . The trick arrange two lights sides screen see reflection.The AC adapter great money saver , I usually read 5-6 hours night , burning 3 AAA batteries night really solution : ) If Kindle , I would strongly recommend Duet2 instead single light version , cuz 's almost twice much screen course , I also use music stand beside reading Kindle . It 's versatile light source , I really like lot . Have used light much I thought I might , works okay . Each light multiple , independent settings . The beams narrow , get two them.The major downside sometimes turn carried things bag . Something bag trigger switch , light may hours without knowing . There good way prevent take batteries light transport.Also , really tell product picture , clip best used narrow thin objects . It work well ( ) object 1/4 inch thick . light exactly I needed ! bright great battery life , AND comes power cord unlike others cord $ 10 . . acoustic duo play lot bars restaurants perfect , lights music book nicely definite must I love dual bulb design . The clamp slid around bit music stand . Overall I like design flexibility . turn-on instrument case gig bag could problem . I 'm sure I 'll need find way protect product breaking since seems like would stand chance gig bag . I bought hercules fold stand works great . There 2 light sources choice 1 2 brighter softer light . The plug-in accessory great , pedal board outlet . It runs fine batteries also . Very pleased . These great , 3 . I use I play duet sometimes band . Used plug , batteries last good I rarely use cord anymore ( enough cords life ) . I use 3 ring binder lyrics fake chords , light everything pretty well . Only complaint - clip n't best , 's never fallen anything like . Will another one die , great product . Not bright I would like ; however , nice . I practice without lighting whole house . I 'm glad I bought . Super , Excellent dimly lighted rooms ... ... ... ... 's purpose really well I plan keep one handy . Thanks good quality products fair price . This designed someone understood need well-placed lighting need read sheet music performing . flexible necks allow quickly twist aim light 'just right ' two open pages . The battery operation nice want portable , I found AC adapter ( Mine came light , check sure get one ) way go piano keyboard place practice every day . My Duracell batteries ran quickly , weeks I noticed light becoming slightly less less . The AC adapter keeps power lights full brightness . The whole unit light enough clip onto music stand back music book place sheet music front . I needed buy extension cord AC adapter cord 6 feet long , sounds like lot , time lay want ( way avoid tripping ) might need add extension cord . I understand LED 's last long long time , good , operate cool low temperature hazard . All , job , illuminating pleasant easy read-by light . This light clips back stand hold nicely . The light LEDs blue tint . I 'd prefer something ' . Each light controlled individually low high setting . I gave 4 starts n't get quite bright I 'd like job . It seems well-made operate battery power well AC adapter included . This Mighty Bright great ! ! ! ! It clips music stand , battery power ac adapter ( included ) lights entire music stand little glare . If need light reading music reading , ... ... ... I already Bright LED Book Light one lighting head , I bought light semi-permanent Holder , mounted arm ( took little ) .This music light one drawback ; n't master switch . To turn lights , would independently turn switch atop light head ( two switch presses ) . To turn lights , would independently light head ( four switch presses ) -- first press brings light lower level second press turns ( light head two light levels : bright -- total 4 illumination combinations ) .I use light music sheets , , books . The & # 34 ; mighty bright & # 34 ; label misnomer sure ; lights ARE mighty bright . They provide enough illumination make even smaller texts readable low ambient light conditions . Each light head provides even illumination letter size sheet ( light starts get dimmer beyond fringes sheet ) , two light heads provide sufficient illumination area . It simultaneously verso recto even largest books . The flexible goose necks music light allows easily position lights reduce glare ( inevitable glossy semi-glossy pages ) .This music light mighty sweet deal : ( 1 ) comes Adapter ( n't come book light single lighting head purchased separately ) . The adapter works music light book light single lighting head . ( 2 ) contrary product description , music light DOES come 3 AAA batteries ( least mine ) Note : If switch using batteries using AC Adapter , 3 AAA batteries first removed battery housing light ( ) wo n't power on.I picked music light theMighty Bright Orchestra : ( 1 ) I 've single head book light many years I trust book light offer durability ( lights indistinguishable save single/dual light heads ) ( 2 ) two goose necks offer lighting flexibility ( 3 ) music light half price orchestra -- -The Bottom Line : The lack master switch music light makes turning on/off lights somewhat hassle ( unfortunate tolerable drawback ) . All , music light functional , far durability concerned , I 'm quite confident last many years come ( build quality Mighty Bright single-head book light , I 've many years ) . Recommended ! This fairly compact & # 34 ; must & # 34 ; accessory working pit dim light situations . This music light easily cover two pages music stretch , three LEDs provide bright , white even making possible see pages music . The heads easily adjusted flexible mounting arms two stage light intensity switch good feature lesser intensity light desired.The small size light makes perfect travelling . I love light . It runs electric need batteries . The goosenecks metal well made LED lights switches turn single double LEDs side . It clip anything want hold . It 's simple , well made works great . My home practice area rather dark corner limited room , I clipped onto music stand . Illuminates music far better previous ones I used , including one used full sized bulb ( rather much light portable ) . Have trouble others mentioned , loses star included ac adapter cord , making intents purposes useless without string along extension cord music stand ( ugh , cords ) .

400	I liked lot . For price work well , I happy I bought . I got couple straight-coupler things , really use quite limited input jack heights different effects pedals rarely height ca n't use straight-couplers . You n't run problem - connect pedal pedal . Like many say , slip easy need keep mind , otherwise price overall quality good cables . How much say patch cable . This good one good price.I recommend . They work well , said , I use rig , bought . We seem pretty happy . These sturdy cables really work well pedalboard . I expect last long time I 'm using cables string effects pedals together ; I 've issues far . They seem sturdy enough rough handling , I 'm noticing extra noise . I found OK heads bigger I could stand use cramped space pedal board . So , sit drawer spare parts cables . use home recording , nothing road . purpose made well . wouldnt use regularly gigging wear tear would break pretty quickly . I ordered two sets I could set everything nice progression stomp box . Heard evidence hum seem work fine keeping everything order ! By way , listed .5 feet ( 6 '' ) , actually 10 '' . Wish I measured I ordered 12 '' long cords thinking would twice long . , bad I discovered 2 '' longer ! Well made , sturdy , adequate use pedal board connect various pedals via traditional way . They job made well . I guess high dollar cables better 's hard tell difference . These little patch cables indispensable since I used set pedalboard . They 're durable tough , yet provide high level flexibility comes using tight spaces inbetween effects pedals . I previously using Fender Tweed patch cables , n't flexible enough , even though looked cool days . So 're looking great patch cable pedalboard , look friend . If 're using pedal board need . Good price ... quality . I use times short patch cord better tripping longer cables . I use additional effects outside pedal board 're perfect patching amp head slave head . BUT ! ! ! ... . If 're building pedal board AMAZON sells , solid , male , connecters ( Digitech Hardwire Accessory Premium Gold Plated 1/4 '' Male ) work great really pedal board . I bought two sets ( 6 total ) Great cables , added hum . The side . I need buy effects pedals pedal problem . The cable great material , 90 's right lot strength durability . Price right sure . What I say , great patch connection , stiff harmonics I could detect . And I 've crappy cables buzzed looked - n't . No gold connectors need best best maybe looking elsewhere . For rest us , looking good stuff good price , ticket.Highly recommended . These cords seem hair longer conventional cords , nice . They also seem quality without bulky . Some `` quality '' cords I 've purchased past stiff bulky , I needed flexibility . These cords strike balance value , ca n't go wrong.UPDATE : I 've lowered 4 star rating 3 . Over time , half cords developed problem coming unplugged pedal plugged , seems unique problem cords . About half worked great , half odd little issue . I 'm pleased purchase . The cables flexible , quiet pops loss signal . Not much else say . Buy . I 've bought number use Pedal board . They performed excellent failures , noise , loss tone . n't mind molded cable . I use MXR Effects Pedals awesome . Top Quality . I would recommend anyone . Sincerely , Doc I hard time paying patch cable costs almost much 20 ' cable . These cheap priced much better others . And Work Great ! No loss Tone cables . If anything I EQ adjusting using I far greater signal ( volume frequency response ) I replaced patch cables ! I Love Them ! ! ! It works fine reach equipment , three inches would nice . If reach , 's great . Right size , well made , job . I prefer 90 degrees , right . I looking something like long time , like , likes pedals good option . , quiet , good materials , durable , etc ... Maybe best helping space bcuz large plug'heads ' , perfect job guitar signal ... honestly , , 's I need ... Good stuff ! I bought bunch I started building pedal 're inexpensive , seemingly quite high quality.Tons bang tone loss , added noise , right angle ends little big bulky , may well tight jam packed average boards work great ! I gig record . Great product ! Only negative check b/c ends bulky . I bought second pair . All I got ta say job good price . Good stuff . With small pedals getting plug ends bulky - even right angle - still sound good . I real problem patch cables . I got christmas gift n't stay pedals ' input jacks without causing problems push occasion . Most problematic connection EHX memory boy digital memory man ... never problems cables , refuse stay put without constantly adjust . I figured I would splurge buy backup cables I wear cheap guitar center ones ( match ) . They well built feel like take abuse . I probably 2 packs shortly switch cables . nice get ur effects , great product , exactly supposed , connect Ur pedals , , , great cable , short useful , also quiet They cheap bought 3 pack quiet . I need order couple packs though ! I thought jack , I noticed would n't stay pedal . There `` click '' assuring cable place ... 's reason , n't ! Slips right every pedal I . Not reliable . I playing 17 years seen alot patch cables . These great quality price cant go wrong . These currently cables I use pedalboard . Short monster mogami , best get money . If 're looking perfect patch cables effects board , . Very well-manufactured , durable , reliable , I 'll use Worked perfectly needs . I n't ton pedals needed patch cables connect . When comes quality cables , I 'm really picky . I know 's bunch gear snobs turn anything consider & # 34 ; inferior & # 34 ; quality , usually , observation , cheap affordable prices bad quality higher end merchandise always super expensive . If need patch cables rig , fine . These cables really best . They sound perfectly , look feel strong , contact perfect . Life time warrany . Recommended . Planet Waves built company making affordably priced accessories patch cables exception . I bought local Guitar Center price . The thickness connectors seems hold well although I may look slimmer alternative soon reviewers stated also connector ends bit large could become difficult work smaller crowded pedalboards . These help remove lot clutter pedal board . They snap way appear good quality . Just I 'd expect company . I bought chain together effects pedals guitar . They work well . I n't much recording gigging though , I 'm sure well would work activities . But practicing messing around home , work quite well ca n't beat price . I 've never short never experienced humming noise distortion . I definitely recommend anyone looking chain pedals together . Its quality small price , good looking budget wires . Overall good buy These cables excellent quality cables , however , trying patch pedals together closely spaced setup , cables rather bulky stiff.The large size right angle connectors requires space pedals might prefer , especially compared pedal patch cables available companies Hosa . I purchased little pedal board `` The stepping stone '' well made heads well secured . The plastic thick nice cables come massive 5 year warranty I 'm sure 're going bad anytime soon.Buy confidence . Great price quality . It nice connect two pedals 6 inches away 10 ' cable . No cable noise , works well pedals n't play nice right-angle plugs ( like original line pedals ) . Great little product , I would buy . This really good patch cable . Fits different brand pedals well really flexible feeling like cheap . I able weave Pedaltrain Pro problem . In fact I 've order 4 sets rest pedals . Highly recommended . Just like last reviewer , I also use link MXR/Dunlop pedals together . They surprisingly well made I dont notice signal distortion drop sound . No , . I well pleased continue using planet waves cords . They solid , durable , reliable ( cheap well ) .Enjoy ! connecting pedals tandem , got two three packs using quite time one failed yet . Nice value well . Bought read reviews . I signal loss using cables.. 's like loose connection inside cable . My connections , I thought I dead pedal.. I wiggle hold get signal . It 's flexible almost like ( kidding ! ) . If want cheap reliable pedal cables , go get one Pro Co , I bought cheap Sweetwater Ebay , surprisingly good quality looks durable ! Great product . D'Addario always makes great products great prices . I use pedal board always reliable cost effective . Great effect pedals . No noise durable . Great product price . I would recommend buying . connect pedals little signal kill . good buy price nothing else required . good quality sealed connectors . Needed patch cables pedal board . They I expected . Not bulky , right angle plugs save space . I bought planet wave cables Electro Harmonix OD Line 6 M5 , needed small cable pedals . I highly recomend model cables , really works good pedals others . I 'm enthusiastic amateur , means I care gear , 's living . I buy best gear afford , I ca n't go Mogami every cable I need . Planet Waves dependable durable stuff prices weekend warrior pay . These sound good ( I mean n't sound ! ) , made well . The design wear well . I 'm pleased . 
401	It 's rubber slip strings sound hole ... little effort . It might even & # 34 ; engineered & # 34 ; , fits well . This product fit Takamine G , hole 3/4 size . I buy Lute Hole , customized part . Beware , 'd figure item would fit inside guitar , given advertising . Even guy Guitar Center , I called find going , told go Lute Hole . I never use item recently , , upon necessity , I found item bound damage guitar , even fit . Be , careful . In fact , , wary , I briefly heard light `` cracking '' noise I tried fit guitar first time . I stopped , thereafter , research online finding G 's specs . I 've read , elsewhere , kills tone , I willing try utilize tandem actual coloring rig . Ultimately , I spent nearly $ 100 I wanted , kind item . What say era - caveat emptor ? I finally feedback free ! I use 310 Taylor K & K ; Pure pickup system.I play mostly church worship team , usually right front blocks tones entering guitar via soundhole.I n't get huge loss tone , little bit.I take worry moving around getting feedback like crazy ! Highly recommend . . I bought Planet Wave 's O-Port ( advertises help reduce feedback well ) I use every show I plug-in . This must anyone plugs n't want worry feedback . This cover fit full size acoustic/electric Hohner guitar . I measured whole 3 7/8 & # 34 ; , cover even come close fitting ! It measures 4 & # 34 ; diameter , check guitar closely ! Works advertised . feedback far experience concerned . A little tight . It needs force put place . Not sure 's standard among guitar makers size sound hole Planet Waves best guess universal fit product . But Washburn needs little bit convincing get . It works well , I use Oscar Schmidt . I n't use feedback , I use protect dust . It fits tight 's fine ! barely anything guess thats im one playing guitar , another room im sure would make difference Works advertised . Great eliminating feedback live setting . Also great muffling sound playing around house quietly . I impressed well works . I always fighting feedback practices live gigs . This solved ! It 's important know diameter guitar 's soundhole . I 've tried 2 different acoustic electric guitars ( Fender Fender ) , diameter fits perfectly.I read reviews deciding purchase , found people complaining good unplugged sound filtering . I tell right since made . Even affect guitar lowering normal sound ( unplugged ) , I would consider solution it.If feedback issues due acoustic electric guitar , without hesitation one . It 's good . Was lot feedback got tired taping make shift sound hole cover . Recommended . It good , thing I get wire attaching cardboard going feedback buster thing . two minuscule holes enough see still bother little . Gets job done . Fits great helps eliminate feedback . I could see problems size sound holes tight fit definitely works . Does n't reduce sound worth darn . I thought plugging sound hole would muffle things . bit maybe , really reduction dB . This soundhole cover one products belongs list essentials acoustic guitar player , right tuner , string winder/cutter , cleaning cloth , pack extra picks , capo . It 's designed eliminate feedback plugged sound system , nicely . It 's also great sealing body guitar want dry dampen quickly ( 2 nights like case ) . This good product I 've seen many people use ... however , 's acoustic guitars . That little bit info missing info , although I known . In case , guitar 's sound hole small unit installed , even though 's supposedly & # 34 ; tapered & # 34 ; fit lot different sound hole dimensions . Did n't look tapered , I ca n't use . But , pretty cheap , I may use day . Check guitar 's sound hole diameter ordering . Fits perfectly sound feedback waking next room.No plastic smell Ibanez acoustic electric . Works well , easy install take . Helps greatly control acoustic feedback . I 've looked , glad I purchased gets job done . I would say much though . arm feels like went gym jam session

405	We bought daughter 's boyfriend ; saved last gift give Christmas Day ; wrapped strap around neck never put back ; I still n't think come hands minutes ; I believe happy gift ! I wanted mandolin fool around learn play . But n't want spend amount something I could new guitar . I pleased price quality . They take great care pack well worries either . Buy want started n't toy . I bought Rogue mandolin friend ( bought Amazon time even play ) 25 $ , still brand new , never played.I owned played many mandolins ( dozen ) , one mainly practice mandolin setup skills . The mandolin NOT playable brand new state ( tune , action high , lower action result string buzzes ) . And quite typical new mandolin without proper setup . I went thru necessary steps ( almost like luthier would ) came sweet . It low action , string buzz , good intonation . One find info mandolin setup Web . It 's quite tedious work.This beater mandolin , 25 $ , nothing beat it.It stay tune long enough play one hour straight without re-tune . So adequate daily practice . Often times , even stay tune next days . I may consider replacing tuner machines better one . The finish model blemish ( small black spots top sunburst color ) , look really close , I would consider defects mando cost hundred , less 40 $ , problem course , mandolin match expensive ( ) I gave 5 stars based high performance / cost ratio.If n't know setup mandolin , prepared pay 60 $ 80 $ professional setup ( must , otherwise mandolin hard play play tune ) . Some reviews gave mandolin bad rating due lack knowledge ( 's unfair ) . All brand new mandolins require setup ( expense ) , unless store setup charge higher price it.If lucky know someone setup free , would save cost two mandolins like ! ! ! Having bought 4 sizes Ukulele , discover Baritone Uku much like classical guitars lower 4 strings , I curious 60 bucks see like play Mandolin . If interested style play , search You Tube videos watch people , I found anyone cutting Hotel California things..I also didnt feel like I wanted learn yet another chord set ( tried playing electric guitar , even going getting Rocksmith software learn ( prety cool ) anyhow , I changed strings Baritone ukulele..so Mandolin thin neck , ( Maybe width ) I watched videos people playing necks look wider , hard fat finger ( yea I fat fingers ) .My initial problem thing doesnt come delivered anywhere close ready go , Saddle moves , hard mounted height I figured , also put 3 1 oil nut tuning strings dont drag ( whether right wrong I dont know , I regardless ) I measured nut 12th fret , 12th fret Saddle moved saddle measurements really close , tuning trouble withe , I bet problem , , Tuner set strings Tight , , another problem , thing twang high pitched , like dude ( Again You tube someone posted videos tuning ) I also read buy stiff pick , , I guess I gentle smashed strings , , couldnt keep pick fingers . I use light one , using stiff pick bend create delay I guess two strings ( note ) , light weight one works well , ( I pick thing ) hard tune , I use Ukulele Snarks , pick one string time , cute guitar regardless I saw one sale Used Guitar Center 75 bucks , someone play guitar , might fun , , I suck , I pretty much suck Ukulele playing manage play rock tunes actually sound like something..I might day figure tune like ukulele play songs three four chords , good luck . The mandolin arrived time came box within box mandolin wrapped . There damage none tuning pegs broke . I tuned pretty easily able figure simple songs.I removed pick guard I really n't like looked looks fine without . The strings come work fine none snapped . Even end wanting play , always hang somewhere looks nicer I would expected . The problem I two G chords fit completely nut heard adjust fits properly . I got I really enjoy sound mandolin price amazingly cheap . Also , another difficulty I tailpiece comes easier goes back . If interested mandolin definately get try . I got one years ago starter mandolin . Do sound good Gibson ? Not hardly . Do sound good 40-50 dollar Chinese built instrument cheapest materials could find ? Actually , yeah , . This one instruments case cost much I would n't worry . When get , action likely high ca n't lower bridge enough wheels 's easy enough sand bottom . Also , like cheap instruments strings trash . Just throw strangle cat something . Decent strings n't cost sent labor force day built , actually might piece pretty playable ( fix bridge strings ... ) little instrument . The hardware n't best tuners suck hey , 're starting , tuning part $ 49.99 ( I 've seen new ones 10 bucks less time time ) 's worth investment . You spend dinner movie , watched flick , 's gone . With money spent , 'll something keep entertained falls apart much longer one evening . My 7 year old boy owns mine beats hell , far , good . It 's holding well.BTW , $ 49.99 breaks , discover lessons cost mandolin ( ) , since 're reading , means 're net get plenty starter lessons youtube get going , , find MANY good help along even one day 'll get better instrument . I 'm actually thinking getting another one beat around I n't take chance ruining good one camping whatever , I get cold run wood , almost cheap enough thing may may know resale value . If go certain online ( ) 'll notice people ask 50 bucks MORE , sometimes 100 . USED . Same , people know cost new . This one cases I 'd buy new used . If decide sell long 's pieces 'll still bring 20-30 bucks used wo n't much , really , 's good servicable instrument little work , 're lucky might actually set right get . Again though , big deal fix 's , stated elsewhere n't trussrods . That 's bad . You 'd surprised many mandolins n't years ago alot still around . Even big makers . If neck warps year two , big deal , got worth . kicking around awhile , last year 7 year old ( 6 time ) beating I still pick , tune play .

408	I 've used straplocks many years electric instruments ; 're fairly inexpensive , I 've never problem , never broke one replace wear/abuse , I 've NEVER guitar/bass hit floor . A couple warnings , nothing quality straplocks : 1 . ) need make sure screw snug hole ; people put , toothpick , piece paper inside hole tighten hole 's big stripped ; I use touch 's Glue , screw straplock , let sit day . 2 . ) You make sure ends fasten strap securing enough strap n't work end ; use socket get nut really tight . New straps seem easier secure . I Schaller Security Strap Locks one guitars probably purchase Schallers one soon . These give added sense security adjusted work gravity , post sits lock rather depending springs hold place . My Larrivee came converted Schaller . Their two issues strap-locks I come first issue thick straps . I purchased nice leather 's strap ( I love ) , n't seem enough threads lock fit strap . I managed get work thinning leather strap vise . Overall n't huge issue , bit annoying.The second issue actually concerning . Both guitars begun randomly unclip straps fallen ground . Not good . I think something metal locks getting either bent worn , whatever I n't like guitars fall floor.I two guitars , heavy . It 's first thing I I purchase instrument . They 're pretty easy put strap guitar , securely hold instrument place , mostly . I 've one guitars ten years , probably wo n't change different set locks , fear stripping holes guitars , next guitar getting Dunlop straplocks ( http : ? ie=UTF8 & qid ; & sr ; =8-1 & keywords ; ) seem lot better sturdy . Schaller guitar strap locks work really , really well . However , I problems first I made First , need put drop lock tight threads nut loosen . The blue stuff Second , lock grab strap pin guitar turn/loosen screw time . Kinda defeats purpose locks hold button button comes guitar . So ... When I install new button , I put drop epoxy screw hole first . Never one unscrew things first , never guitar strap fall accident . Ever ... But , remove strap time want easily lock . Schaller strap locks keep guitar place . They around long time hold well time . I also used dunlops , nice well , seem better product IMHO . After years playing , I rather choose small strong accessory take care precious guitars basses . Our family 2 guitarists 1 bassist switched style locks year ago . Every one us continual problems locks periodically unscrewing guitar body . I one back gig damage brand new 60th Anniversary American P-Bass ... good . My son one come middle gig last weekend.The problem design 's ton friction top bottom pieces lock results tab 's screwed body unscrewing . We 've tried applying bar soap , petro jelly , spray based dry lubricant ... . none prevented ultimate forces cause phenomenon.We switching Dunlop style locks design incorporates ball bearings allows strap rotate freely back forth next zero 'unscrewing ' force.We tried make Shallers work could . Maybe 're active stage tolerate equipment damage performance distruptions caused us . I 've using Schaller Strap Locks guitars since 1980 's . They give sense security , knowing guitar strap totally secured guitar . I consider cheap insurance . I 've strap locks couple weeks , however , 've performed well far . The fail proof U holding guitar sold . I would recommend strap locks others currently market , I 'm working designing better lock . I bought Amazon year ago installed guitars . I nickel black heavy basses never let . I since installed electric acoustic guitar convenience purpose . The locks work great give added sense security.The reviews locks speak matter style guitar , whether 's Les Paul , strat active bass , I would strongly suggest . I never used Dunlop locks , heard Epiphone Gibson Les Pauls mounting holes suited thing note come longer screws use needed . I never use , nice touch ended parts bin . About ten years ago , I installed strap locks first guitar ( Fender Stratocaster ) . They worked well easy install . I subsequently installed Dunlop strap locks many guitars mixed results : screws really small would times get stuck middle installation . I drill additional holes two guitars ( Gibson SGs ) . Ouch.This made take second look Schaller . The components , beginning screws , much higher quality Dunlop . It took ten years realize I made wrong choice . I gone Schaller beginning . I replaced strap locks Schaller excellent results . This second set . I bought 1st set 1980 's I 'm still using guitar matched . ( black hardware ) . I impressed quality 1st set 2nd set good . Money well spent . I found everything Schaller make 's Grade # 1 My book . Made Germany ( NOT China ) locks fast secure . I like way slide & Your like Me change Guitar 's show home , change smooth safe . No dropping guitar 's around ! ! ! I My guitar 's . This simple reliable gets . n't need anything else guitar secured belt ! Schaller sort household name among guitarists , 've making product long . You probably already know thing . All electric guitars equipped . Certainly worth every penny pay ... vary price sure dealer dealer . But $ 2000 plus guitar last thing want drop bad strap . These great sure . These locks ones I use , guitars I put I build . I guitar drop since I started using , read anyone else one drop either attached . I tried Fender lock recently although great lock large Schaller equipped straps fit . I stick Schaller 3 colors .

410	Despite sensitivity compressor microphone I still use record heavy metal guitar . Only thing I use small amplifier , fifteen watt Line 6 spider 3 . I keep volume neighbors hear guitar . Anyways , thing I use recording software I record guitar loud . And oh records good ! Now I longer record straight computer I get loud compressed guitar sound .

So record quietly . This mic sensitive ! But oh boy I like ! Man I play hours guitar goes way better drum loops . And I said amp gon na loud enough bother neighbors . A good buy well worth price . n't work ( day got ) . In control panel mic n't pick sound . instructions , emailed blue support first person quick reply 3-4 days answer . Maybe 'm impatient mic worked couple hours since got ... If guys know good alternatives please leave comment . This mic fits studio need perfectly . It 's USB connection works great voice overs great sound sensitivity . I would recommend one Im starting podcast . I buy blue yeti . I understand one person youtube channel would love . Great voice overs . In sound proof studios . The sound quality good picked WAY TO MUCH . The ability select 4 recording modes great . If youll use . I would reccomend recording 2 people . However recording choir something would work . But I never neither . This microphone usb port . Not XLR . So hope expanding . If ever want host podcast 2 people need throw away get mixer 2 new I get 2 Audio Technica 's , 1 Behringer Xenyx 802 dual mic input Mixer , 2 shock boom combos 2 windscreens price yeti , raidus shock mount , pop pop filter generic mic stand.Now I replace mixer keep 2 mics , replace mics mixer sorts expansions add ons well get quality audio 2 hosts podcast.Do get yeti unless youtube voiceovers forever I sound guy - I wanted something plug record practice sessions . This vastly better webcam communications microphone recording instruments.The four direction settings fun , though I find using stereo cardioid settings . The headphone jack great . I impressed first time I plugged everything tried - 's nice hear playing sounds outside standpoint.Setup easy , quick . I experienced times plugging registered recording device , failed actually use . This may windows problem , fixed quite happy build quality . The base hefty wide , mic firmly . The body buttons plastic , solid , n't feel look cheap . After 1.5 years , microphone lasted VERY long time stayed fantastic microphone . As I getting serious voice , I moving better equipment , starter microphone general : It deserves nod . Definitely fantastic purchase , happy ! I used many microphones , expensive , Sennheisers , Sure , AKG less expensive Pro Sony . I spent 8 years professional radio 30 plus years voice recording sound mixing , I heard used types mics I rate Blue Yeti top list many reasons . First sound quality , patterns smooth , open sound , cardioid pattern added richness voice work , comparable dare I say Sennheiser Sure . The sound patterns colored muted frequency level , I expecting stereo mode , pattern , voices sound great acoustic guitar sounded rich , plucky natural . Next construction mic stand , pictures I expecting plastic , nope , made solid metal , except buttons switches . Third versatility , record almost anything type circumstance adequately , excellence , try $ Neumann ! The set could easier , plug USB jack let rip . I paid $ 100.00 Amazon , true bargain , top notch piece gear , engineers product really took time design something real quality looks like piece art . The Yeti also stands audio processing , I say mics I used $ show weaknesses . The thing I would like see shock mount made mic , big mounts , Yeti seem pick much vibration table mics ( I also use slab 1/4 '' neoprene padding absorb table shock ) , Yeti real audible self noise . If want great microphone incredible price , Blue Yeti one ! Addendum complaint shock mount resolved , Blue Radius , I received week ago Amazon , I love . Makes great , I mean great microphone even better . I done side side comparisons Neumann U87 , , , top notch expensive studio mics . The Yeti sounds good . Of course learn work microphone properly get right sound . I cringe YouTube demos mic , folks using , I 'm sure mike 's correctly get best sound . Also I use Yeti , seasoned becomes , comparison recordings done year ago , Yeti seems get smoother sound , time goes . This microphone words IS AWESOME . The sound recorded device modes left nothing desired . I use mic voice work gets added videos playing major hotel rooms . Superior mic ! This excellent purchase . great range audio pick-up , mic versatile . Great product ! arrived timely fashion , worked perfectly box , used several times record piano . The sound clear well-balanced microphone picks sound well within range around 10 feet . The latest addition desktop flexible recording device I 've yet found : The Blue Microphones Yeti USB Microphone . Long known line high-end condenser microphones , Blue increasingly known computer-ready USB microphones , like Snowflake Snowball , Yeti latest certainly greatest computer-ready microphone yet.Advertised first fully ( standard ) microphone , Yeti large ( 12 '' tall removable stand ) , hefty , multi-pattern microphone suitable recording , podcasting , audio activity . It features four switchable omni , , figure eight , stereo- built headphone amplifier , gain control , volume , mute button . For even flexibility remove desk stand mount standard 5/8 '' microphone stand sounds great , too- even better well-regarded Snowball series . I 've using recording music practice , building tracks Audacity Windows linux boxes , Apple 's GarageBand , making calls Skype . The ability record full stereo mono real plus . Up I 've using variety microphones together various microphone preamps A/D mass cables power supplies bad enough desk , real hassle trying use laptop away home . The Yeti one package . It may sound quite good multi-thousand dollar condenser microphone vacuum tube preamp , money simply ca n't beat . Yes , make perfectly good pod voice overs . Trick : treat room sound deadening . I looking affordable mic enabling make announcements home computer would approximate , indistinguishable , audio quality heavy-duty Shure microphones used FM HD . All mics I previously tried price point lower , including Blue 's `` '' line , sounded overly treblish , pronounced sibilance ( listen provided first reviewer video demonstration ) . By contrast , Yeti rich resonant , sensitivity permits using without benefit pop filter . Short spending 4-5 times , I 'm convinced best option particular case.At time , musician without home studio I seriously doubt I 'll make much use mic performance recording . As far performance goes , size unit could compromise presentation , upstaging performer ( least vocalist head ) . And traveling purposes , I 've found Go mic best fit laptop computer ( even though Blue 's literature shows Yeti alongside laptop ) appears trying ways product . Its size weight likely buyers well provoke reservations -- perhaps leading purchasers complement strikes home studio mic one Blue 's lighter , compact microphones . Its onboard amplifier circuitry convenient permit unprecedented versatility . But reviewers mentioned , volume , gain , pattern knobs rather loose , allowing lateral vertical well expected rotating movement . The knobs turn effortlessly smoothness one might ultra expensive professional equipment . There 's slightest hint resistance one point gain control 's circular movement , 's 12 o'clock position , 's difficult say whether knob intended quick easy assessment positioning.In sum , Yeti please anyone wants broadcast record fuller richer sound previously attainable comparably-priced mics , prove useful ( mention handsome ) addition home studio . It 's still bit early make pronouncements worthiness metal road warrior . It 's main competitor Amazon -- Audio Technica AT2020 -- pint-sized compared Yeti , I 'll confess I 'm still sure whether I made best choice ( 2 mics alternating 1 2 slots mics Amazon 3 months ) . I wish direct reviewer comparisons indicate whether AT 's relative compactness light weight come compromise -- however slight -- audio quality . [ I experienced initial hesitancy Yeti 's part make appearance Input Output panels ( System ) iMac . Then I read instructions , discourage plugging mic hub . Plugged directly USB port computer , Yeti immediately sprang action . My good , powered hub would equally effective . ] This best USB microphone $ 100 bucks.It 's shame years , one else try make microphone sound quality one . I love sensitivity adds little color recording . The sound rejection cardioid pattern good I fairly close computer office I ca n't hear computer recordings.I n't used microphone instruments , I using primarily recording voice overs video , sounds great.The thing plug , go . You need additional drivers run microphone Windows 7 . I restart machine video editing software see microphone , worked perfectly that.I wish option skip stand get shock-mount - combo pack , I mounted shock mounted stand attached desk n't used base much since setup.If market excellent USB microphone , look , ca n't get anything better $ 100 bucks . Just make sure get pop filter , Yes BLUE Pop Filter work microphone despite negative reviews n't . Just check review video Blue Microphones The Pop Universal Pop Filter This good quality microphone . The sound quality good various modes , although I used primarily cardioid stereo modes . It 's easy set . Under Windows 7 , I plug . The instruction manual n't updated years gives instructions Windows Vista XP . The instructions Vista mostly accurate Windows 7 , I found default settings better recommended settings instructions . Also driver supplied company . The Microsoft driver work fine , might sonic advantage making driver . But means custom control panel use obscure Windows ones . Also icon microphone n't match product , n't really big deal . It 's matter attention detail . The instruction manual English French , warranty information French places . They say two year warranty give phone number area . There 's copy actual warranty website , although terms violate US law I idea handle actual warranty issues.The real negative I experienced setting keyboard . I 'm using fairly standard Logitech wireless keyboard , experienced lag , letters showed I typed . I unplugged USB cable microphone things went back normal . process yielded identical results . After rebooting computer , problem went away . Hopefully wo n't long term issues.The bottom line single problem related quality microphone , works well , clear , extremely sensitive . It pick whisper 15 feet away clarity I sitting two feet front . That 's volume settings work clearly I really two feet front . The side pick every stray sound letting hand rub shirt letting feet rub carpet . But practical considerations rather limitations faults microphone . 
411	This little amp kicks major ass , . I think I may blown speaker 's sounds 's great lo-fi kind tone gain levels way . The clean tone really nice , little bright taste , amp 's bad . I take plus tele friends house sit outside away . Theres jack , 9v power supply 's plug ins , No line ca n't plug ipod whatever play along oh well . If big rig want something small like camping trip friends pretty great . mini amp arrive battery stated literature . good thing I purchased 9volt power adapter . I really surprised output considering small speaker size . ideal kicking house small friends . already come 9volt adapter along cord . would worth increase price come altogether . would purchase , Honeytone Mini Amp - easy way get great sound electric guitar . The color unit soft ( almost brick red color ) . Paired Zero Hum AC Adaptor , 's highly portable amp setup . `` '' using 9V battery instead AC adaptor . I think best purchased together enjoy benefits rig though.A headphone jack amp means enjoy amp 's impressive sound quality without bothering neighbors waking spouse.Included amp Owner 's Manual simple start-up instructions . You 'll need cord ( one goes guitar amp n't provided part amp package ... ) . The manual several control settings following sound tweaks : -Clean & Amp Cats Under Solo 80 's Clean 60 's Neck 's 's paid $ 20 amp could n't happier product . Do n't hesitate pick one yourself.UPDATE : space back unit 1 9-volt Batteries , use included AC adapter power : reviewer Paul Stewart : `` As point clarity - current version item NOT ship adapter cable . Be prepared purchase tandem . '' FYI ... UPDATE : 4 years ago I bought item , 's still going strong ! Great : ! It 's still kickin ' along . Super buy mini-amp . Look , 's plastic box 's 5.5 & # 34 ; square 2.5 & # 34 ; deep , cheap three-inch speaker inside . It produces decent sound , although 's substantial background hiss nasty habit picking digital & # 34 ; static & # 34 ; computer . It 's OK practice amp , I certainly would n't want perform . In short , 's small step toy level , 'd expect twenty-dollar amp . That n't mean 's useful , need realistic 're getting . trying `` electric '' feels acoustic guitar , n't want waste much money electric acoustic ( preamp ) guitar big amp I n't like `` '' . After researching awhile reading tons good reveiws , I decided give try . I n't expect much $ 20 amp , surprisingly , positively gives I ask . I also adaptor , great save $ $ long runs , I n't worry battery home practices . It adorable box ; looks like lovely toy , works professionally based amp . I n't care much manufactor 's suggested modes , basically , I fool around three button controls whatever sounds I like different songs guitar / uke . I like small size wo n't take much space tiny room , 's cute look , practical ! I high feedback one reviwers I used poor pickup ; however , I changed another one , I turn volume high I want direction setup previous poor pickup . I almost thought issue amp , luckily , I two different pickups try deeply . After using better pickup , amp n't issue yet . I used times , I n't know longevity yet ! One thing headphone mode completely silent guitar 's sound wo n't muted , headphone mute effected sounds amp ; anyway , 's great feature . I one amps capable everything clean heavy . I love . It 's got tone ! I play either Martin thru Strat knock-off . Either one sounds awesome . Never dreamed enjoyable little amp , let alone $ 20 . Battery life seems OK , I hate messing batteries , I 'd buy power supply ( get 9V supply ( check proper polarity ) store buck ) . Do n't even think . Get . $ 20 pocket change . This little amp exactly son needed acoustic guitar 's output playing outside porch . The amp produces much `` bigger '' sound much better quality expected . This eat 9v batteries also picked AC power adapter uses houses.We also like headphone jack , cuts sound speaker plugged in.Highly Recommend ! CFH knew would small n't thinking small , , shore cute , , good enough , long-run , , shore loud size , rattles turn amps slides vibration , ,if keep lower sound fine , temporary use . ok tiny mini little amp ( 's size good , ) n't fender amp thats , For $ 20 ca n't go wrong . Its lot fun use little amp practice goes anywhere . Based reviews , I made purchase . This great unit , sounds good loud downsides , . I live 4th floor . As long I turn volume , acts like radio.. I mean loud radio background I could n't get ride . This thing , I think depends people . When properly tuned , sounds strange makes lot noise . ( Other radio part . ) None major issues , mini amp ca n't really expect much , mention 's expensive . Overall I like I would recommend way , unit comes 9V battery . I got I learning play guitar . I using borrowed First Act guitar without amp I wanted see kind sounds I could make . It inexpensive fun use . The sound quality n't greatest , 's expected . You dial quite different sounds comes sheet showing make different sounds . It 's light make sure set floor pulling guitar cable . I pulled table couple times ill effects , I would n't want take chances . perfect amp bed practice ! plug near practice like practice , heavy amps move plug , great sound practice concerts ! nice item good purchase Bought son . Its perfect practice . Great portability . Has nice clean sound , well decent overdrive sound . Sounds great electric acoustic . Its surprisingly loud small amp . You ca n't beat price . I highly recommend ! Sounds lot expect , 2nd Honeytone ( one home , one work ) . You use batteries 9V adapter , clip hang belt wherever want , also headphones input . It gets way distorted high volume , come ... 's $ 20 amp ; well . This fun little practice amp size large sandwich . Three knobs , volume , tone gain give little versatility . Runs forever battery . I keep mine next couch I always plug fun . It 's small also quite loud want great little deal price . Stop waiting grab one , ca n't go wrong . It 's going win sound quality , sure cute . As might expect , 's pretty boxy sounding little amp , reminiscent 60 's portable transistor radios double stack Marshall . But two things I wanted . First , belt clip , I attach belt guitar strap . Second , headphone , I plug set ear buds ( 1/8 & # 34 ; stereo jack ) . You get clean decent practice room level keep drive control set minimum . Surprisingly , Drive control works 's way gradually , letting control distortion bit guitar volume control . With drive control cranked , get amp unexpectedly loud , terribly distorted . For something throw guitar gig bag take wherever go , 's bad . With set earphones , I would put par expensive available . If plan use practice amp 're moving , I would recommend getting power supply ( use ones effects pedals ) . Battery life appears around hours , performance starts hour 's use . I use bass , I get deep tones , great take play acoustic guitar friends . Tip : sounds better n't cramp way - stop 90 % . I wanted portable small sized amp using electric guitar outdoors -- really position pay big dollars one high end brands . There course , little bass response one tad tinny , hey , 's 9 volt battery . I wanted guitar audible practicing outside neat little device . They put lot thought amp , outstanding budget price . Keep mind , patch another 9 volt powered device one enhance -- I point run Boss Digital Delay box check . The belt clip back triple adjustment dials nice , I got red change pace , I always get & # 34 ; black & # 34 ; equipment . It looks nice vintage front design gives lot character . Nice product , Danelectro . I bought amp back 9 year old son take park ... This nice little amp , sounds prety good price . Just dont expect booming base grand sound . I buy sell electric guitars often I meet someone half-way point access electricity unavailable . I surprised volume tone came unit small . There even overdrive makes totally cool customers want schredd little . This battery operated plugged using adapter . I bought Planet Waves 9V Power adapter go Honey Tone . It might work situation . Do n't get wrong ... great little amp practicing ... eats batteries like candy . I think like 2 three hours playing I throw new batteries . But playing street corner thing ... little amp belt clip . Ok I 've owned 2 Danelectro amps . For one cheap price , loud output , used external speakers attached computers via wired purchase cheap Bluetooth adapter ebay amazon . Recently I purchased item ebay $ 10 - Bluetooth Audio Music Receiver Wireless Stereo Adapter For Smart I connect tablets , smartphones , computers use amp great external Bluetooth speaker . Plus battery life great . Try buy speaker amazon wattage 's cordless works battery power , spend well $ included battery worthless dies 5 minutes . I installed rechargeable 9v battery ( ebay ) lasts I still use lower quality jam amp I want ... price hard beat . This micro amp real blast ways one . And NOT toy . Do n't price -- real amp based stompbox electronics , may Marshall stack , adequate highly portable practice amp well performance amp small spaces . It certainly loud evoke complaints neighbors bought amp use harmonica practice . To end , I use belt clip mount hip . Then I patch mike , twiddle controls , go town . The tone fairly pure although , mike least , I also get pops , crackles , squeals . This pretty typical anyone amping harp , Honey Tone fault . In general , amp pretty forgiving input . I 've used high-impedance mike ( Astatic JT-30 ) , low-impedance mike ( Behringer XM8500 ) , electric guitar ( Fender Stratocaster ) . It handles without noticeable signal amp exactly ? My guess Danelectric took circuitry overdrive stompbox , added amplifier circuit , put whole shebang retro case . The result quite appealing . And overall look feel one quality . The case solid albeit plastic . The three controls ( volume , tone , overdrive ) , , smooth control tend get better components . The input jack mini jack headphone output solid . Someone Danelectric sense humor touting unit 's `` leather '' strap , though . It decorative useful.If operate overdrive stompbox , know work amp . The volume control obvious . The tone control bass/treble mix ( significantly , opinion ) . The overdrive control adds fuzz distortion ( , great degree ) . The instructions describe 16 `` sounds , '' someone Danelectric sense humor . Otherwise , label one setting `` Send cats bed . '' Ignore instructions set controls whatever sounds good you.As I said , small really toy . I 've personally found useful practicing blues harp 's easy set ridiculously portable . And I decide I 'm good enough Station , baby going . I cant tell impressed mini amp , I expecting little amp somewhat sound , Instead I could n't put away , I must played least couple hours complete , The tones able achieve little knob adjustment amazing , I would recommend anyone needs cheap amp , The 9v battery holds well ( surprising considering drive got ) So spend $ 20.00 get something real deal , I hope helps decision purchasing one I wanted like . I really . The idea amp portable cheap made think , & # 34 ; Perfect & # 34 ; . However , unit I received @ p , I 'm going assume defective blanket positive reviews . The one I got kept cutting . You might playing solo line might hear 75 % notes something . And holding chord , sustained sound would cut seconds . weigh whether try replacement unit . The so-so sound overall quality however n't give another go . Bummer . Any suggestions amp similar size portability ? Cheers I 've tried several & # 34 ; portable amps & # 34 ; . For price , HoneyTone ca n't beat . It volume , tone overdrive knobs ( overdrive go way , easy one ) . Comes battery connected 9v adapter ( important note : reverse polarity , negative ) . Interestingly I found amp seems work significantly better pickups better magnetic pickups . But small , portable , light-weight practice amp one hook belt attach earphone ... n't come much better . It belt clip back 'll supply earphones 9v adapter want . Battery included . Of course guitar cable required worth money .

It 's finally soft I could play naked without slicing head ! So buy prepare really abuse days soften ! This strap pretty thin . Not like price I purchased Amazon . Still job , 'll see quality , The strap good quality since new still feel stiff I happy I got . The strap looks great . Very cool design looks good tele . And 7 bucks w/ prime shipping . So ? This fourth strap purchase Planet Waves . I grown love Planet Waves ' straps comfort durability , obviously designs . I thought strap others different design . Mainly local music shops , I never seen/felt Planet Waves strap NOT made usual thick , soft , durable material ( whatever might ) I grown love . This strap VERY thin brittle feeling , makes uncomfortable use . This strap DOES slide easily shirt ( I prefer ) makes contact neck makes neck sore itchy . Needless say strap definitely suited playing without shirt , Ouch ! I tried running washing machine times fabric softener along using constantly try get broken . But still sharp package . Maybe years years use finally soften . That lasts need know strap NOT Planet Waves straps . The material thin brittle feeling ; unlike many straps Planet Waves . If comfort important get strap . The price ca n't beat give guitar 70 's look . If I would paid $ 20+ strap I would furious . But $ 7 strap still steal . This strap fantastic old-school look vibe , I 've never slip playing . The downside 's bit rough loose skin . I could never play strap without shirt sometimes rides I feel neck ( rare playing loose t-shirt ) . For 99 % situations strap rocks .

No breakage problems , etc . These came American Tele 2004 , I 've buying ever since . Sweet action , durable , affordable . Decent strings I used beat strat I . Nothing special good enough . I 'd recommend . Same kind come guitars Fender factory . Classic sound . I switched D'Addarios capture Frusciante sound . I 've used quite strings imo best feel , sound overall quality . If play Fender instruments ca n't go wrong using strings . Of course strings subjective thing I say I used 2 different strings life guitar store one day picked Tele immediately impressed strings . I looked back noticed colored ends I thought D'Addario strings I found odd considering new Fender . So I little research found Fender indeed colored ends well . Been buying ever since love . 
417	I used replace Pot MIM Telecaster . Works great . I n't notice change tone . It worked like old one . But main worked . And Tele sounds great always . Comes , 's bonus . These pots CTS nice tight feel compared Alpha pots . Alpha little cheaper , basically tolerance , slightly looser feel turn , get job done pretty much . What really boils whether prefer slightly tighter feel , slightly looser turning knob . Perfect guitars . Sounds great telecaster Stratocaster guitars . nice choice . Excellent choice . I little disappointed . Do n't know 's QC problem I got rejects 6 pots , 1 spec ( ) 2 almost ( , ) . 1 right money 2 within 10 % . They 's I 'm bit confused . Other work fine , nut , washer cap included ( knob ) . I upgrading caps . Hi , I thought pots would come without proper caps , ` description product , , I 'm pleased , installed yet ... CTS brand , ` hard read uF caps , I think standard Fender guitars I 've never one pots fail . Never one go scratchy . I 'm sure , pots , I 've either fortunate well made pots .

Pot , , nut , cap included . ser el producto fender original se que es robusto.. con una lo Saludos desde Venezuela ! ! I bought replace recently busted ( generic ) volume pot . It works like champ . I 'm stickler genuine OEM parts I typically Fender . These purchased parts bin . They fit , work , quiet wo n't make life miserable . That 's I want replacment parts . Used replace dead volume pot older Strat-type guitar , sounds great ! The diameter threaded portion little larger original , Chinese pot , I needed cheap reamer ( purchased Amazon ) enlarge pickguard hole . It 's nice , smooth pot scratchiness . nice big lugs solder . Good upgrade Squier Deluxe Strat . Although , note pickguard n't Fender made brand , hole pickguard maybe little small . Not worry . All I took drill bit size & # 34 ; screw & # 34 ; ( knob goes , drilled pickguard , thus fitting . Over nice purchase . 
418	I Taylor GA4E . The elixir strings came nice bass , bright . I tried martins , 's I love Seagull S6 . However , strings n't enough bass much highs . I bought recently I love . They much better original strings . Very rich bass really comes . The highs well balanced still shine without bright . My one complaint mids sound bit muddy . Anyway , best sounding strings setup I . Now buy different bridge : also put Seagull Mini jumbo wow ! Every time I come back several weeks , I forget I put . Then I pick wonder sounds balanced nice supporting bass realize John Pearse strings . Worth every penny . Was pleased 600L PB acoustic guitar strings . I wipe strings Planet Waves microfiber cloth time playing seemed like would last forever . Plus tone bass strings improved D'Addario EJ16 light I using installed factory , I kept replacing like kind . 600L exact string read review Music ( Amazon affiliate ) John Pearse 710 PB trying I like even better 600L . They keep bass strings 600L ( A , D , G ) add strings medium size : low E ( replacing .053 ) high E B increasing , .012 .013 , .016 concern ability bend B string using little finger blues F chord position - problem.The improvement tone right places . Very nice . Yet overall tension set increasing slightly 10 pounds total , lbs . D'Addario play fingerstyle set said ideal fingerstyle offering balanced tension across strings.I suppose things always subject change , , I amazed delighted strings . You would n't think simple string change could make much difference , somehow . Everyone opinions . I told great strings others tell quality control slipped passing John . What I say strings go really brassy bright days . They slowly mellow seem last long time . Sound really nice Taylor . I bought strings suggested customer local shop . I play cigar box guitar stay uncoated strings get traditional sound piezo pickup . This first set I impressed . These flexible strings another reviewer mentioned , seem work well three string chords sound good tube acoustic amp.I would purchase needs . Previously I used Ernie Ball Earthwoods flexible light form , great also . It would toss two , I know sound alot better basic SP strings I tried previously . I usually use Martin SP 's , I decided give try . I 'm pleased , I would rank SP 's . I little recording I admit , sounded little brittle .

421	A friend gave overall I like . I 'd give 3.5 stars I could . Having said , I n't like much regular nylon pick . The star hole feels bit weird , though I could probably get used . I 'm glad I got try , wo n't replace favorite nylon picks . I usually use fender .73 picks seemed fall fingers I playing . So I picked . I longer worry falling hand . The star middle allows fingers connect star able get good stable grip . Hands best pick I 've used . I guess I tried every type pick around . Thick ridged things thin strumming edges , great big triangles oh remember cork circles one side ? Look easy , star hole means I grip n't move I let go . Never one break gauge marked much nicer digging `` pick pen '' counter local music store trying find 3 feel right . Yup 3 'cause three $ 1.00 I used use Tortex pick buddy mine gave one . I ended using pick something like 3 years ( playing 1-2 times/wk ) . Once I started playing church , I decided pick proven self I order small box . I never dropped one never broken one . FYI : I generally n't play hard I always play acoustic , Nanoweb custom lights . First saw YouTube video , genius ? A pick stays hand ... Makes wonder ever played without ... Small price big help ! I say one Fender Medium heavy . But star grip super . Hard like . Get ! 
422	I 've disappointed tuner . When I 've used needle keeps jumping way right ( sharp ) back left ( flat ) . I two ( 2 ) tuners I bought Wal-Mart I always get accurate tunings . I bought KORG 's brand name Company outstanding reputation . Even though tow ( 2 ) Wal-Mart tuners older , still work better KORG . I tried several different tuners 13 years playing . I found model fits needs perfectly . It quickly detects tune , dynamically changes turn tuning pegs , extremely accurate . It also options tune flat , sharp , guitar , bass , etc.It also small portable . I one 12 guitar cases fits accessory pockets/pouches perfectly . I cant recommend tuner always , please indicate review helpful keep rockin ' The quality feel tuner good . Tuning guitar really easy , put batteries ( comes 2 AAA batteries ) press red button turn , pluck strings ! This first tuner great already ! It 's portable . This thing works well little easier see less jumpy old tuner . The LEDs little cheesy compared old one though . But maybe saves battery life . I n't know . It gets five stars job quietly fair price 'm also glad I bought one specifically guitar/bass chromatic one . This easiest tuner I . I sorry I gave away I upgraded . LOL Wonderful use - soon I put batteries started even without reading directions - easy There better tuners . Far better . This could good , seems Korg products seem think Standard tuning tuning , n't even tune well Standard ( especially tuning G string ) ! I personally play exclusively Standard electric playing , sometimes I want fiddle around acoustic . This makes incredibly difficult tune tuning using `` F '' `` C '' notes . I clue , pretty stupid ask , especially consider majority generations guitarists metal heads playing drop c tuning acoustic ( I say love ) play open tunings . Trust , money best spent elsewhere . Bought tune bass . Works fine price cant beat . Highly recommend budget tuner . It works beautifully . Arrived time promised expected durable easy accurate well , described . Had return first one . Second holding 's . Just using electric sure acoustic . Spot used correctly inline cables . All tuners like going little `` jumpy '' , none perfect . This job perfectly get hang it.The Korg Pitchblack little price range , working perfect . Overall fair priced tuner reputable brand ... five stars . I AM GUITAR FOR ABOUT 15 MONTHS . WITHOUT THIS I WOULD BE . I WORK WITH A WHO PLAYED GUITAR FOR 30 YEARS . HE IT TO ITSELF . WHEN I HAD TRY MY TUNER HE THAT GUITAR WAS TUNED TO ITSELF YET SO FAR OFF . FOR $ 15 YOU BEAT THIS . DO N'T BE SO CHEAP . BUY THIS AND ENJOY IT !

Although I n't purchase Snark SN-1 Amazon , I wanted share excellent customer service experience company clearly cares customers . I problem Snark , company displayed first class customer service -- exceeding expectations . The SN-1 must-have far I 'm concerned . I using iPhone friend recommended Snark tuner . SO much easier use , I like logical LED display shows 're flat sharp . On iPhone , app I 've using n't always display frequency I 'm really tune , I visual indicator tuning . If I better ear , problem , shows bar display , also displays notes string playing . Much easier -- n't need select tuning anything first . It picks frequency whatever string 're simply dial , sturdy clip well thought-out foot pad works perfectly acoustic electric . I usually leave Snark music stand I use visual metronome . You also clip nearby desk . Buy confidence -- 'll love . : Although I still love little tuner , model suffered issues I address . I 'm certain 's design flaw , little plastic pieces serve socket joint ends adjustable ball arm tendency snap . I think manufacturer look perhaps design single ring plastic may integrity . Also , rubber feet fell long ago moderate use home . The electronics held admirably . This tuner clips easily instruments I , shows pitch quickly accurately . The screen bright , battery lasts long time . It actually dims display battery dying , last like months . I 've banged mine around bit , 's stayed one piece . The plastic solid unbreakable . The size tuner bit large , 's smallest market , small light enough I leave uke 's headstock I ca n't feel extra weight . Easy operate , easy read . I like much I got another one right away I thought I 'd lost first . Now I two , considering getting third keep travel bag . I bought second tuner gigs . It awesome ! Easy use , easy see .

Very long battery life . Easy see . Oh , I mention ACCURATE ? ? ? Yeah , I think I . I use acoustic primarily , sometimes electric guitar . It accurate easy use . I always hated tuners ; I would rather use tuning fork A string go . Most tuners cumbersome require large batteries external power ( pedals ) . In addition I could n't use acoustics . Snark solves problems . The display colorful easy read hides neatly behind headstock . There also visual tap metronome shows beating heart sync tempo . I easily move electric acoutic , Amazon 's pricing low I considering getting one guitars . This one 5 star ratings I 've given product Amazon I rate lot . I ordered Amazon warehouse refurbished item . It properly packaged base broken poorly glued together . The glue n't hold clamping base separated stem allows meter swivel .

Recently I purchased reviewed new GoGo TT-1 clip tuner . I never thought clip could accurate dependable Boss . The GoGo awesome instantly became tuner I use . But I say , I think Snark little better . I bought SN-1 SN-2 inexpensive amazingly accurate . The great thing chormatic , besides great tuner , leave clipped headstock practice accurate string bending learning notes fretboard . The display easy read ... better GoGo ( although GoGo new improved display since I bought mine ) . I love colors matte finish . The rubbery matte finish makes gripping clip much easier smooth plastic tuners . The rubber surface also makes opening battery compartment snap , I fight like heck get battery door open GoGo .

I would say best clip-on tuner I 've chance use , except broke first time I carried gig bag rehearsal . One little fingers holds `` ball '' `` socket '' back tuner broke , tuner clip separate pieces . This model works vibration unlike red one , without clip , useful ( possible hold head stock still use , n't convenient ) . I would super-glue together good angle , I put different positions different instruments . I 've seen number complaints elsewhere problem , I would call design weakness.Despite negatives , I would buy another construction sold hard protective : Added back star . I 'm still managing use together fix involving rubber sink washer . Even slightly compromised mount , continues provide excellent results . I recently purchased replacement , SN-8 ( B ) , found really disappointing . So much I may send back . I also tried Planet Waves Mini Headstock Tuner , matter much I try , I simply love .

424	Love strings . I use exclusively Gibson LP Studio Deluxe seems corrode ordinary strings quickly . I washburn glossy , sealed looking fretboard , n't problem , still prefer strings well . They tend little stiffer ernie ball 's , I like way sound feel great bending sliding . I keep guitar weeks daily playing without corrosion I get brands . My favorite brand strings right . 8 guitars fitted . They bend easy , last longer , feel smoother shot Finger Grease Spray adds icing cake I n't owned electric guitar year , I 've replaced strings . I 've playing almost every day hour two still looks feels new . At rate , seems current strings I installed would last forever . Would recommend anybody looking long lasting set . I get everything Amazon . Need strings ordering stuff bought piggy back shipping . Elixir Tom uses I trust judgment . He makes one finest guitars world finest depending like course . Have lot used kinds strings , I Not like changing strings seem last decent amount time . bend n't break . If bending couple steps I would love know string holds consistently . Thanks much . two weeks I put A string broke close ball string . I break high e strings occasion . something thick A string ? ? maybe defective string I thankfully bought two sets I able pull A set fine since . however I dilemma I buy strings use second set I need . Further I stick brand . supposed last longer average strings . At point I going keep playing set time change go . I update I decide I stick brand go back super slinky'supdate another month went ( week ago ) D string broke fashion leaving believe I either got defective strings strings good said . either way losing another star . happens different set strings I reevaluate change accordingly Yes , strings amazing . I discovered new Taylor I 've put . They really better string . I fan Ernie Ball D'Addario acoustics , , I 'm using . They brighter tone really brightens acoustics . They bend easy nice electrics . They , however , seem take little breaking strings ... 's worth . Been fan years . I occasionally use strings fun , always go strings every time . They feel great fingers long period time , sliding easy , keep tone forever seems like . I recommend everyone I talk plays guitar , always stick em . GET ! You wont sorry . They always sound first day , I love strings , currently guitars I using strings last 7 years . The tone last longer string n't break . In 7 years I n't broke single string . That said I n't play heavy . I buy strings day I die . especially acoustic version ... I used Elixir 's guitars past 3 years never disappointed . Their tone great nanoweb 's feel nice 're playing.Disclaimer , I would recommend nanoweb , NOT polyweb . Always best string I buy . I like Martin coated well I prefer . This first set I electrics far good . I bought strings buying Elixir strings acoustic , I pretty happy . For strat , however , strings sound right start . After week I really started wondering head I really n't sustain I thought I usually got new pair strings . I convinced strings causing problems , I right . I put pair D'Addario XL 9.5 ( highly recommended players ca n't decide 9s 10s ) amazed much tone sustain I losing Elixir strings . I feel like I could move fretboard easily strings , lack sustain tone forced stay way electric strings permanently . Do n't let higher price strings , go good set D'Addario Ernie Ball strings consistent long-lasting strings . I really like strings , I sweaty hands tend make strings guitars corrode rust fast . I play guitar , leave 2-3 weeks , strings rusty nasty I return . I rub strings thoroughly session playing , stil I happened across Elixir nanowebs . They great . I longer need rub strings thoroughly , stay rust 2+ weeks ( regular playing ) . However , I encounter one strange thing . While playing rehearsal , popped broke , hurting finger bit . I surprised , string n't look downside . With regular strings , tell string near end life b/c looks really bad . With , may still look okay close breaking . Made little still prefer 100 % strings , though . While Nanowebs coated coiled , Polywebs first coiled completely coated . They feel , smooth play sound amazing , I mean really amazing . The Nano 's sound quite smooth rich heavy 's . I would recommend trying types electric guitars . The Nanos may sound better hollow-body electric , may sound better solid body electric ; 's personal preference like anything else . The Polywebs though feel really smooth give really fat , mellow , sweet sound . These best strings ever . I 've tried almost every string market , far favorite . They sound great last forever . Believe hype ... really DO last FAR longer strings , sound great strings sound great short , soon get `` '' , lose brilliance tone , become dead sounding . Not . They sound great life string . In fact , way I know change eventually stop sounding good ( n't ) , I 'll start intonation problems I know strings need changed . Normal wear tear , strings last SO long.I 've tried polyweb strings Elixir well , I n't like . To , n't FEEL right . Sticky something ( like fingers stick strings , like could tell coated ) . With Nanowebs , sound AND feel like regular strings , last forever . The string I 'll use . far strings go . A lot people swear I get much tone life strings cost whole lot less . 
425	I bought tote POD HD500 around . It fits snugly , well . The accessory pocket fit power supply plastic Line 6 expression pedal . The shoulder strap makes feel important . respects arm 's desire freedom movement . My qualm 's Gator brand , remind Florida . I 'd rather pretend Florida n't exist . I purchased case 6 POD HD 500 . It 's well built , solid case price . It fits HD 500 snugly large pocket front cables . I would n't drop POD thing , basic light duty carrying case job well . I bought specifically GT-100 . It fits , snuggly , almost like designed . There enough room front pocket power supply , input output cables maybe little . I also able put 3/4 & # 34 ; binder top GT-100 sort protects screens knobs bit , provides place stupid lead sheet binder never fits bag good size accessory bag carry along guitar combo amp couple pedals cables , odds ends want bring -- -- -- -- Looks like basic quality gator Fits like snug glove ( little use perfect ) pocket- Reasonable priceCons -- -- -- -- They cost reduced logo thread stiched logo cheap vinyl like silk screen iron patch .

This good product , would liked padded wrap around handle & # 34 ; non cost reduced & # 34 ; logo . Not much I add review n't well covered already . It 's nice bag offers protection equipment . There design flaws I could see giving people trouble time . But overall 's great product.I wanted add work enough room needed effects pod & digital wireless rig . Mine came flattened little box . I n't happy form deformed . Well days popped back shape I n't ship back . A good sign ! I using music computer stuff . The bag well made considering price . You even get backpack price . I love depth . A number types bags shallow zipper burst loaded . This solid 4 '' + depth cozy padding around protection . Be sure check dimensions though . Its long - I bit surprised . I think I saw `` micro '' thought shorter.Not great music tote also decent computer / electronic tool tote equipment wider brief bag backpack . I 'm thinking getting another this.The minus I wish outside pocket little larger maybe inside pocket folder / paper slot . But wish list items . padded bags size pain need options limited . Lucky good option . This bag works perfectly Digitech RP 1000 pedals size . I also use older Digitech pedal works like charm . The construction seems sturdy far I ' problems zippers .

426	While I heard devices great recording concerts heard great recordings back claim review focusing main use podcasting . After using Zoom H4N weeks I 've found versatile tool podcaster 's arsenal gear.I mainly use H4N record podcasts using Allen & Heath mixing board . I usually two person podcast I one location person brought via Skype . Using Aux sends board 4 track mode H4N I record one channel , person another channel sound effects music supplied iPad stereo channel . This makes editing breeze everything track.The sound quality H4N excellent easy hook external microphones unit . You hook either two XLR microphones two 1/4 & # 34 ; jack sources ( combination ) bottom unit one 1/8 & # 34 ; input back unit accept stereo microphone line level stereo source . It 's combination lets record podcast onto 4 separate tracks.The H4N also let record using two attached microphones internal microphones time well , could useful 're looking capture background noise recording something location say mix crowd reaction soundboard great device podcasters studio field , letting produce high quality recordings environments . Five stars without doubt . I purchased H4n unhappy H2 's performance significant I could n't record good sounding signal n't distorted Line In jack . Only find H4n problem bad . If I try record line level signal sound board stereo receiver connect H4n 's 1/4 inch jacks , almost impossible distorted signal . It appears models line preamp sensitive clips easily clipping preamp , adjusting gain n't correct . I contacted Zoom 's tech support H2 told I likely defective unit . I returned H2 decided give Zoom another chance try H4n seeing many positive reviews.I really like H4n 's design , menus controls nicely organized . It feels sturdy H2 . The recording quality using built mics excellent . Most recorders price range n't XLR inputs . Since I plan use mostly recording concerts connecting line tape sound board , line jacks n't work properly ca n't accept normal line level signal without clipping , I ca n't use I bought . I used Sony minidisc recorder type application past 8 years never problems . I 've worked pro sound equipment 25 years used many types recorders far Zoom products ones I encountered problem . If using record mics , works great , need record line level sources , Zoom recorders may good choice . I exchanged Tascam DR-07 Tascam n't many bells whistles , It nice recorder I 'm happy . 4 stars I 've used stereo mode Stamina mode . Stamina Mode supposed run 11 hours . Perhaps , , turned maybe even record mode . No one records 11 hours straight , I 'm guessing turning wears sooner . If , I 'd rated 4 stars . In terms clarity , flat response transparency , excellent . The Auto Rec level smooth n't sound severely limited squashed . At rehearsals , whole band kicks , levels quite loud , comes quickly smoothly . In terms features , I comment . This thing many uses ridiculous . I mostly use record live band rehearsals , 's pretty amazing . I 've also recorded interview audio recently used USB interface DAW interface went kaput . If using film , music , field recording happy . Easy use interface well constructed . ) records excellent audio built ) records excellent audio inputs portable versatile.3 ) I love 4 track ability effects built device . I record multiple things less time especially I 'm messing around get feel song4 ) comes memory card batteries ready go ) battery life weak2 ) built mics placed well pick noises want . Yes ! ! ! ! finally ... reading endless tons reviews several types recorders I hit nail ! ! ! ! play really LOUD metal band ... none us record savvy anything like ... want rehearse rock hell . But needed tool catch band practices course remember `` riff '' next rehearsal . We tried various recorders always complicated practice , well ZOOM H4N changed everything . Simple use quality recordings ... .well INCREDIBLE ... little thing ... distortion kind ( careful place ) . I still need read lot users manual ... take word ... I hate manuals ... I figure use ( extremely basic ) hit button rock . Finally I came back home I plug pc I amazed quality sound ... recorded mode two extra mics ... man ... .I havent even tried multi channel mode yet ! ! ! thanks ZOOM ... rocking basic recording 's 's supposse ... AND ! ! ! I H1 H4n I love . The H4n great versatile field recorder . I mainly use record audio live event video weddings speaking engagements . The H4n work horse . It ton features records number different . I highly recommend purchasing `` furry head '' wind screen unit foam wind screen included door use.Unlike H1 design hard protective ring around microphones , H4n leaves microphones exposed order capture purest sound possible live studio applications . However , aware exposed microphone design external mics prone breaking unit dropped . I happen . If happens , n't worry . I searched internet able find several Zoom service centers within general area . I called closest service center , spoke repairman shipped H4n mic replaced warranty ; I n't pay dime . I shipped back 7 H4n great field recorder . I mainly use 4 channel mode . 4 mode allows record external microphones well two XLR inputs time . In cases I also use small 4 Channel Behringer field mixer I run 2 microphones . Running straight mixer outputs H4n works perfectly.I suggest accessories using H4n . As I said earlier , purchase `` furry head '' wind screen . I use furry head wind screens every time I record outdoors completely eliminate wind noise . I use Sandisk SD cards Sandisk dependable , I never ever one fail years recording . I record @ .wav format tends create lot data live events large enough record sampling rate . This allows keep old audio clips card recording safety net case I forget transfer audio files along video I edit . I also suggest DI box hand event may run line someone else 's mixer . I issues digital clipping saturated sound running feed without DI Box venue mixers . This balance padding I going get trust , DI box simplest surest fix issues . I also suggest getting small portable mixer case run 2 microphones live events . Always prepared . I use rechargeable Duracell AA batteries I never issues . Battery life 6-8 hours unit left , 3-4 hours left powered recording.I regret purchase . The H4n handy little studio go dependable . I highly recommend purchasing one . Although big push days behalf latest entry , pint-sized H1 , H2 still . Perhaps good reason . Amazon 's price H2 going less 50 % H1 , yet H2 offers sound stage wide 360 degrees almost portable easy slip pocket H1 . The latter offers popular mic configuration , 're `` fixed '' mics . wanted ensure widest separation , 'd unable aim mics opposing directions . Also , H2 set flat surface securely less sensitive touching part machine . I 've owned machines found construction quality wanting , SD door broke loose , on-off switch came loose H1 . Both somewhat tricky operate , settings visible dark places nonetheless require , accurate , quick , small fingers . ( Some users bound react negatively minuscule size H1 's storage cards . ) Both capable full-bodied , full audio , remember treat Zoom video recorder strikes best built bunch , 's solid metal practically , limited settings make easier use either H1 H2 . However , I found impractical use concert included video component distracted listeners behind . Also , size color 's anything stealth brings us 4th ( expensive ) Zoom , H4n . It 's versatile Zooms , permitting movement mics addition external mics authentic mixing . Still , build quality notably superior H2 , 4 Zooms , 's , intended user whose willing take time become familiar versatile learning curve . After less satisfying experiences first 3 Zooms , I sent H4n back favor Sony PCM-50 , constructed like compared plastic Zooms . I see Amazon 's description Sony misleading , since PCM-50 NOT permit user record MP3 format . WAV format offers , simplifies recording process , allowing user select file size software program used editing process . ( The side limited duration WAV , requiring user employ Sony Sound Stick addition built-in storage . ) Great Recorder many use external audio recording DSLR video.I surprised quality built stereo one star display menu system terrible.Not intuitive many steps get changing checking basic I get used . Overall , Zoom products , unit winner touched 's competition 's price category except perhaps Olympus cheaper Zoom ton quality good , features good ( unit 's price range XLR / 1/4 '' TRS inputs ) records high quality.However , I think Zoom almost went far features perhaps could focused making THE BEST digital recorder grand making great USB digital interface instead spending money 4 track feature built effects works O.K . much easily realized simple digital 4 track recorder ( e.g Tascam ) The manual Japanese translation person experience recording devices like might really struggle learn use unit ( although 's fairly intuitive operate one familiar devices - I gave manual around menus , unit still little ' operate advanced last comment regards H4n USB interface . I played bit far make good interface . First 16 bit I get work drivers . I read ASIO drivers available Windows 7 I use XP . I may try use still 16 bit therefore much use serious interface work . There direct monitor function still seems timing issues multitracking DAW software ( I tried Cakewalk Sonar ) . I hoped use laptop portable interface sadly I ca n't seeing much use regard.However , overall unit stellar I highly recommend . I read folks issues line inputs ( e.g . recording stereo mix mixer ) . I personally n't see problem , inputs designed accept variety signal types . If working situation one always use TRS Hi Z unbalanced XLR Low Z balanced converter , available Radio Shack around 20 bucks . 
427	If ca n't find container add sponge , buy this.Keeping valuable guitar humidified think item cost three bucks , $ would still yield healthy profit ! I made stuff dollar I think better.I use one baritone uke , bigger ones I made I use make , make sure let sponge drip , ie , wring , make sure actually touch bare wood . Excellent product , simple practical design , holds firmly inside guitar mouth keeps humidity levels safe zone.If humidity levels area go 40 % simply need provide extra humidity prevent cracks . Planet Waves humidifiers simple use great product guard drying guitar causing splitting . Dampen sponge , squeeze excess water , insert sponge holder holder strings . Check every days keep sponge damp . Could n't easier . I use winter long guitars . It 's nothing special . No frills , simple concept works . It 's important maintain humidity instrument , especially dry climate like west Texas . The rate depend amount humidity air store , first start using , diligent check sponge regularly ensure still moist . This compact humidifier easily filled included plastic syringe . If n't , drip , simply place case instead usual sponge . Purchased replace Dampit drip alternative . With solid base drip fairly easy use . water extend life sponge . Overall simple , I may added much humidity . Was using conjunction humidipak keep drying thinking would absorb excess humidity , I noticed reflection pick guard tone seemed muted shifted humidipak humidify outside guitar case.I use I n't think effectively reading inside guitar , inside case.So I think Planet Waves humidifier works well intended purpose , monitor utilizing . I electronic thermometer shows relative humidity whole house interesting see quickly relative humidity changes inside outside electronic thermometer.The whole house humidifier pumps 3 water day 1500 sq ft house fall winter keeping indoor humidity around 47 % .This makes house feel warmer makes breathing easier . Makes whole house safer use little case humidifier like help humidity , I think really need whole house solution monitor system.A sponge zip lock bag holes works well . Just n't get water wood.And n't forget take silica gel packs little accessory compartment case . Many guitars come shipped job remove humidity better acoustic guitar shops I go big humidifier running showrooms . I thought I would throw two-cents new design effectiveness soundhole making homemade case humidifiers things like travel butter container many holes drilled sponge , I started thinking cases separate body cavity neck & headstock cavity inside guitar case allowing humidity flow freely areas , especially body needed though I getting acceptable humidification case I concerned body dryer comparison I went ahead splurged 8 bucks . ( I actually bought three . ) I crank gas heat house winter A/C summer , keep guitars inside cases inside closet . The humidity drops quite low , sponges remain moist several days I longer fight urge re-wet . great tips one : Use regular , dense sponge , thicker like ones dollar store . Cut size stuff ! Throw away sponge starts get yucky n't worry distilled water , unless want . I ca n't argue using pure water compared possibly toxic crap comes , one dollar get boat load cut size , toss away without regard needing replaced.Do n't worry & # 34 ; thing & # 34 ; hanging in-between strings . It damage anything unless get sponge saturated leaks . I either squeeze excess water , shake container sponge inside I satisfied wo n't humidifier cause stress damage strings spreading wedge inside soundhole.If ARE rough , careless , thoughtless , stupid , could possibly knock loose rub fall , I would worried guitar would take happen . This would extreme guitar humidifier harm could top snaps squeezing sides release little tabs stick top cover . The sponge inside quite small , n't much room much larger sponge . The device simple fairly solid . Treat gently last forever . You easily clean inside run . If give inside quick rinse every fills , I 'm sure would decade anything & # 34 ; built & # 34 ; require extensive cleaning replacement.Keep eye first days weeks get feel re-wetting sponge.Try keep sponge moist 's strongly suggest getting Oasis case humidifier , ( similar ) mini sized 1 & # 34 ; X 4 & # 34 ; costing around take guesswork equation give fairly accurate readings inside guitar instrument , much humidity cause acoustic guitar warp . Too dry shrink crack , split soundboard ( top ) also leaving edges frets sticking like fish quite abrasive ! If spent one hundred dollars guitar live gets cold and/or dry , would ( careless ) spend make sure ai n't thirsty ' , worse ... dead & broken ! Hope helps ! I wish little longer lasting trick . My guitar would probably happy without . This upgraded version guitar , The first one green stuff use used plastic syringe ad water . This replaceable sponge , take , soak squeeze excess put back container , would say gets humidity . It 's simple , basic , I n't think good job . This n't really humidify much n't extend far guitar . A simple system humidity guitar ; The price right simple use . This simple humidifier guitars round sound hole . It would work archtop types instruments mandolin ukulele . Inside sturdy plastic case appears ordinary kitchen sponge . If use distilled water ( recommended ) last quite . The top comes gentle press sides . The dry sponge little difficult remove fingers tweezers needle nose pliers work perfectly . Do n't push way wo n't problem . I drip little distilled water sponge , squeeze excess , assembled case pops easily D G strings , suspended middle sound hole . They ca n't seen photo small ridges side hold top place strings . I 've never one move I left it.If sponge n't dripping wet never problem drops water guitar case . When humidity low ( 30 % less ) sponge dries 2 3 days even case n't opened . As humidifiers type check every ever crack appear top favorite guitar ( n't want see one ) use guitar humidifier ! Especially winter - heating house tends drop indoor humidity safe levels ( 45 % 60 % ideal guitars ) . Air conditioning . For especially valuable guitars would worth buying keep case guitars one room keep guitar ( ) okay . For many reasons 's always best keep guitar case gig bag use . A humidifier inexpensive extra precaution times year temperature humidity changes quickly . I bought product notion cheap No refills buy , except distilled water . In actuality , really simple design.I like design better one simple fact . If wood guitar already dry , 'll refill humidifier often initially . 'd rather using distilled water pack refills required guitar humidifiers . After guitar gets `` ? `` , I usually end wetting sponge every 4 7 days . It definitely gets taken several time refills , 's much , good product could probably fashion bother . Try sponge order avoid water damage Fits nicely acoustic guitars . Just requires dampen sponge distilled water . Luckily I keep hand ! I bought guitar humidifier Taylor.I received exactly I purchased works should.This product recommended many guitar players around me.It simple design fits perfectly strings.Easy use really sponge keep plastic good . Works . But It splits two middle strings way peace mind allows comfortable . They made thinner n't stretch strings much & consequence , fit thin sponge dries easy far Arizona & California Planet Waves : I think make thicker instead splitting strings , redesign mount , say Velcro 's still hangs sound hall 's attached strings . It 's possible attach product different way I 've modified mine & personal preference works without splitting screen . I one every one cases . It 's plastic sponge holder holes ; nothing special job . This good ! Keeps guitar drying , warping , cracking , ! For money works ! Recommend product . We know 's container sponge , biggie . I bought get Super Saver shipping something else I plan keep acoustic guitar weekend place sit unused long periods time . guitar strings getting hooked onto feels bit rough strings . But job . says . complaint sponge small dry areas needs checked refilled 2 times week . I agree others reviews . The sponge small thin humidify small would n't fit larger sponges . Okay price . 
428	This pedal tone ! easy use program , I idea use , really quick I got , great interface , sounds great , need time adapt creating tones time.The great people say arent I really love , matter taste creating tones , preset may good youThe downside AC adapter I knew this.The lights certain light conditions bright , But pedal note heavy , well constructed sturdy , I got AC adapter I dont batteries time.This pedal whole package , effects , great tone , great cleans . The Boss ME-70 nice BOSS GT-10 let install BOSS GT-10 Patches James Limborg . I recommend getting BOSS GT-10 install BOSS GT-10 Patches James Limborg . Now guitar sound like Eddie Van Halen , Joe Satriani guitarists studio album guitar sound BOSS GT-10 Patches James Limborg . Search Google BOSS GT-10 Patches James Limborg . I agree reviews Boss customers insisting $ 300 pedal PSA supply , sells separately . It 's cheesy way meet price point without really . I used OneSpot power supply I already , works fine . Just glad I n't shell $ 20 Boss something provided first thing I noticed tuner good . You get letter , arrow side , 's responsive.The dial-in reverb controls easy , extremely limited . Expected better . You get either room hall . Neither realistic.Going manual awkward . It may take practice.Next thing I noticed delay level respond expected . If I set E. level ( delayed signal level , balance ) around thirty , clearly heard . When overdrive boost added primary signal boosted expected , delayed signal remains original volume , effectively reducing balance making delayed signal nearly Boss start making multi-effects pedals ? Have learned nothing ? Despite somewhat mediocre performance design , ME70 features recommend . Some drives usable . The controls accessible easy adjust . The `` Solo '' setting module nice booster , although apparently overdriven easily boost module - maybe design would nice two levels clean next annoyance limited capabilities optional footswitches . I hoping able flip preset manual setting , turn preamp , step ( one way ) presents ( ) .It almost appears Boss ME70 threaten sales.I 'm looking forward learning pedal . So far , good things , could much anyone else noticed ME70 reviews n't useful ? I 'm thinking checking Vox Tonelab , blown . $ 225 GC , -- update : Despite limitations , I like portability unit . It runs 6 AA 's ( I think ) great want put floor play , example jam n't power update - Tremolo unit stinks . I mean stinks . Whatever `` waveform '' , 's sine wave , smooth . Very poor musical . Whatever engineer charge - screwed big time . Your Boss tremolo pedals much better 've put ME70 . Why would , Boss ? I like tremolo 's virtually useless unit . Some people wo n't notice , like swampy Fender style tremolo , disappointed . I 've stayed away multi-effect pedals years , I spent time messing , playing guitar . I could never get levels right . The Boss ME-70 easy use . It sounds great . 72 patches . My current band even play many songs . I 'm professional musician , playing 6-8 times month . This pedal far I need plenty options avid guitarist likes figure bells whistles . I really like 38 second looping function ... 's plenty time get lengthy , allow layer loops really get creative . Do n't forget order external power supply - I would happily paid little extra money included ... .not sure 's . Double A batteries last longer time I expected would . I n't chance play customizing patches , etc , I 'm sure I 'll pleased offer . Excellent , great sounds , distortions really great . rocks , sound good . Like always , Boss products amazing . As `` Old '' Guitarist introducing new gear rig always makes nervous . With somewhat massive pedal board filled individual Boss pedals often large venues band gigs & definitely large practice studio ( bit heavy lug around ) .I researched every multi-effect unit market today & decided ME-70 best way go mainly `` Manual '' settings . When I received unit , came box ready go ( installing batteries ) worked exactly like I `` rig '' shrunk rugged small With amp simulation & portion I n't need carry amplifier longer unit ability clone coveted tube amp collection twist Boss `` THE BOSS '' effect pedals opinion ... unit combines everything I need & single unit ability individual tweaking . I venture unit 's ability remember settings every venue I gig different acoustics & constant tweaking required achieved tones I want hear . 
429	The diverse pedal I . You play everything Pink Floyd Drive tweaks . Whatever name , pedal Ibanez Tube Screamer camp . The packaging description says uses chip , yes , Behringer got sound right . I 'd say competes well modded TS pedals . What I love pedal TONE knob . For TS pedals price range , 's useful . You set high , n't , yet entire range useful . This great use thing main overdrive sound.I prefer pedal boosting gain hot amp pedal , another overdrive . It works well lead boost rock blues tones . It could also used add touch breakup jazz tones.I bought pedal `` semi-retire '' older Ibanez TS5 soundtank . The switch one n't good Behringer 's . The Behringer much smoother action turning pedal . I use mainly solid state Fender amps , several distortion pedals ( including BOSS Metal Zone ) . I 'd bet would sound great tube amp worth salt . The downside slight lack bass . If routinely run guitar sound 12 inch speaker setups ( esp . 2x12 4x12 ) , distorted tone plenty bass , n't problem . I BOSS Blues Driver pedal I really liked , I got Behringer Tube Overdrive . For blues , ( least I ) want gritty , dirty sound , one implies hurt blues music . I happy Boss , I decided try B. pedal , I 'm glad I . I compared side-by-side , Tube Overdrive much , like small tube amp pushed past clear sounding limit . It 's perfect sound I want , I adjust amount distortion preference . Some like LOT sound , I prefer enough color sound shape , leaving rest playing dynamics I attack strings.I 've retired Boss pedal . In careful comparison , Boss cleaner slightly clear sound , really overdrive , distortion , clear distortion , makes sense . It add sustain , ca n't compare B. pedal 's effect , implies power barely held check , exactly I . The knobs little sketchy - feel like break step wrong- sound great . This little guy pedalboard since arrived mail . I may buy second one backup . Behringer hit home run one . Not sounding pedal price '' , honest goodness great sounding OD pedal . No true bypass , pedal train short decent bypass pedals wo n't detect 'tone suck ' . It sounds good enough I n't mind lack true bypass ! got pedal use along boss metal zone , adds bite distortion range . barely used self definitely price beat . behringer pedals joyo pedals well best market quality low price . thank u guys ! ! ! WOW something scream vintage tube overdrive wont get tied keep producing reproducing hit hit . What I say n't already read amazing pedal ? If thinking buying green overdrive pedal save big green pedal . If looking play know 's cheaply made destroyed seconds . Have backup . Take great care plugging unplugging pedal . That alone cause problems ... As far tone goes rates high Tone God . You go clean outright mean pedal . It 2 expensive name brand overdrive pedals yes earned permanent spot pedalboard . I use mostly clean boost pedal always I never turn start playing . I leave plugged board time . I reach use hand turn . I carry backup pedal ... I LOVE THIS PEDAL ! ... n't ever drop ... I old Ibanez TS9 , I modified original Keeley specs . Side side , difference , I use rehearsal rig . This first pedal , I 've actually read manual , order figure install battery ! The instructions tell use ball point pen , press hinge pins , order remove foot switch cover ! I laugh ever I hear & # 34 ; Holy Grail & # 34 ; Chip . When I modified TS9 , I found Chip , 15 cents piece ! It net order , I felt weird ordering 1 , I ordered 5 . They send 10 pound catalogue every month purchase ! ! ! The Behringer TO 800 cheap alternative original 're budget , pinch . The wo n't notice difference ! I like sound pedal . It gives ss Fender Princeton chorus good tubelike sound . I 2 tube amps heavy . I prefer taking fender ss smaller gigs . The TO800 gives sound I like without breaking bank . I n't used batteries I use 1 spot adapter pedals pedalboard . If you'rethinking want tight budget go ahead pull trigger . You wo n't sorry . fun pedal really seems work pretty good far getting tube like tones . Simple Behringer problematic company . Some stuff useful far beyond modest , entry-level pricing ( e.g . Studio Amplifier , UCA-202 DAC , Eurorack UB-502 mini-mixer ) ... stuff n't served well ( e.g . amplifier , rack tuner ) Web , reviews TO-800 uniformly favorable . Based , I purchased one instead paying many times Ibanez TS-808 . This proved good decision . The TO-800 produces exactly sort sound enhancement made `` seasick green '' famous : creamy smooth raunchy depending whim.The sound lot less money ? What 's catch ? I 'm musical hobbyist . The TO-800 sit safely office floor , likely , never foot . The Behringer 's shoddy plastic case flimsy little control knobs , , . If I gigging musician hand , I 'd want tank-solid construction `` real thing '' additional cost would well justified . Bought great reviews , n't work , like last Beringer product I bought . Will I ever learn ? Very Now working ; got mate genius pedal n't engaging pushed plastic cover pressed black button pinky light came ; sheer fine cover ; replaced cover new bit rubber . And still works.Amazing sound sold Berhinger though I love pedal . It gives right amount crunch needed . Typical Behringer pedal plastic case really good sound . I use home studio durability concern . Nice quiet use scream need . Highly recommended . For money , one 's no-brainer . It 's one-trick pony , 's 's supposed , trick well . Sounds better Ibanez Boss models - warmer less processed-sounding . Plugged solid-state amp , lowest drive setting , sounds like 're playing clean tube amp . Plugged '65 Twin Reverb ( re-issue , real thing ) - WOW ! I got couple weeks ago , looks like hold gigging without problem . Do n't 'gear snob ' looks products - sound matters . Sound like Ibanez Tube Screamer . Many seem complain plastic housing , I 'm fine . Seem durable plastic proven pretty strong many products ... Sounds great I also Berhinger Ultra Metal I think kill high gain metal sound better . Note I use Marshall head , Marshall head Crate Blue Voodoo head pedal sound excellent . I 've got videos YT search , Blue Voodoo . The pedal works described . The draw back battery installation . You take pedal access battery . The thing forget unplug input cord guitar battery drains use . I purchased power supply go along . The problem power supply one thing find plug . It 's ok money works good . I run wide open amp gain pretty high also get retro sound I looking . I mainly use large body & # 34 ; F & # 34 ; hole guitar set heavy flat wound strings . The lows vibrate teeth ! This pedal based famous Ibanez TS-808 pedal . My hat 's Behringer excellent job recreating classic sound affordable package . I n't TS-808 , I TS-9 , TS-9 offer nice gritty overdrive overdrive enough bite bring tone mix , TS800 offers warmth sweetness I 've simply fallen love . Several classic tubescreamer characteristics audibly present : Slightly rolled bass bit mid-range hump , tone control offers useable tone setting . I usually max level knob adjust drive know taste ( never exceeds 12 o'clock ) ; I 've found setting gives tone body depth . I use pedal primarily Jet City head `` pump '' little bit . This combination takes straight Guns ' n Roses ( type rock ) territory.Used clean tone TS800 offers warm , smooth , bluesy overdrive either clean boost add grit depending set drive pedal made plastic , seems solid enough , 's area pedal really merits criticism . But considering Behringer offering pedal [ ... ] , 's clear order Behringer offer great tone low price , sacrifices build quality made . That said , I n't feel concerned pedal suddenly break ; n't rough last good . I giging even serious player . I play fun relaxation . I playing 10 years past 2 years I taken electric gutiar . I simple amp setup Fender Starcaster 15 G practice/ backup amp Fender Mustang 1 main amp . I love Mustang , always found Starcaster kinda weak ( well duh simple practice amp ) . I 2 basic Guitars ( Jay Turser Series Epi LP Special II ) . I normally use Mustang found really appreciating simple clean sound Starcaster give , But one hit wonder . I constantly switch amps getting tiresome . I order pedal whim thinking might add little depth starcaster I might inclined use amp . Boy I hit home run ! The pedal arrived I spent hour playing starcaster . The depth fullness adds little amp amazing . It truely gives tube crunch yet retains nice clean sound levels backed . Flip overdrive button starcaster amp become distortion . Yea I know I ca n't imagine pedal would & # 34 ; real & # 34 ; amp ! I also found I 'm getting better response guitar tone knob . always issue small tone knob made little difference . Not anymore . I spin knob go clean dirty back . Yup winner practice amp people . Just S G 's I plugged Mustang ( set 60 's Red ) turned levels way . Amazingly backed crunch distortion way setting ( I go clean without touch amp ! ) All reviews stated nicely pedal works upper settings great find used effectively clean dirty channel ! I look forward playing nuts bolts thing . Yup plastic . Well I 'm gentle gear ( sits table next activated hand ) I n't expect issues , I thrash metal rocker I would probably look elsewhere durability . Do n't drop jump last lifetime . The switch activation positive easy manipulate . No issues . The dials easy read turn smoothly . The LED nice level brightness . I 'm using AC adaptor ideas battery life replacement . THe box heavy enough stay place , lite enough I could easily toss gig bag worry damaging guitar . Cable plugs rugged seem like last lifetime . I left unit plugged overnight heat either adaptor pedal . palying hour pedal still cool touch biggest complaint Amazon . I got twenty bucks shipped . Amazon gave estimate 10 days arrive ! ! ! 10 Days ! Yea coming Vegas NY 10 DAYS ! ! 15 Days later finally arrived . 15 DAYS ! ! ! ! More 2 weeks . ! ! I 'm pretty sure UPS guy walk NY . I n't know big delay I horribly bummed shipping times . I ordered items ( AC adaptor 5 ft cable use ) arrived 4 days great pedal . Outstanding us simple equipment tighter budget . If simple practice amp want , grab one pedals prepared much sound come little package . I unsatisfied tone either two used solid-state amps , I ordered VHT Special Six ( supposed THE best small tube amp blues harp ) , I also ordered Peavey ( solid state keyboard amp ) . Then I ordered pedal three others ( graphic equalizer ; MXR carbon copy delay ; reverb ) I figured I would find good tone blues music something within combo . Well everything returned except pedal . I found I plug pedal old 8 watt Peavey Rage , I get better tone volume either two new amps using alone combination four pedals . More `` tube-like '' sound top-rated tube amp ! AND ... I want cleaner tone , I dial back , bypass altogether . My complaint accept battery . You must use 9V transformer , included . Oh well , experience pedals battery last long anyway . Yes , made plastic , reasonably careful , problem . UPDATE : I found plugging BOTH high low jacks ( time ) VHT amp , produces `` sound '' . I keep VHT use instead Peavey Rage pedal . The sound either set-up pretty close , VHT requires less fooling around adjustments , resistant feedback . I still might keep pedal though , cause 's easily next best thing VHT Special 6 tube amp .

431	This iconic fuzz pedal . Yes , Smashing Pumpkins used pedal also used Fender ( similar Big Muff octive thing going ) . This subtle pedal . It 's cuts mix well running cleanish amp . I find gets little muddy I run amp 's already breaking . I say thing fuzz pedals though . This wooly , splattery vintage tone like Dunlop Fuzz Face . It really 's thing going . It 's kind pedal I keep time , 's cool tool sonic toolbox . If I I would likely buy Big Muff tone wicker switch . It 's ten bucks little tweekability . feel strange giving classic 3 stars . 's . 's large takes space pedal board . prefer little big muff I played 15 years I tell right , get big amp . Get 2 amps split signal , even . You want biggest amp using pedal . Otherwise come sounding instead `` '' pedal reference , . I couple bands I plugged amp played riffs . The free loose women followed shortly thereafter.If 're looking stinging yet rumbly fuzz , pedal need . I wish went `` 11 '' . I owned pedal many years , finally trading equipment . It produces one sound extremely well , one thing . The sound well late 70 's fuzz sound : `` White Room , Black '' ; `` '' ; `` da '' . Note : pedal produces good sustain , really bad attack . As , really `` Whole Love '' sound . As I said , one thing well , range even classic rock quite limited . If plan cover songs classic fuzz sound , pedal gets 100 % sound . If want also cover classic rock , 're gon na need least one overdrive/distortion effect . I express sized pedal - 's ridiculously big 's unnecessary.if lacking space pedal board u may want look elsewhere retrofit smaller housing - please aware dimensions - thing soooooooooooooo sounds good though - though rob tone It 's noisy , find equalize tone volume , works fine . I bought cause Gilmour uses effect certainly one uses must much better quality product . This pedal exactly title suggests ... creates huge walk smooth rich fuzz ... smashing pumpkins feel . It n't many different tones , well ! And frankly , I find good tone pedal , I n't change often anyhow ! This amazing value , welcome party pedal boards . ( . : I variant ... ) 
432	I bought pick holder I hate putting pick strings hold ca n't play pick strings . I originally thought thing would kind large go way across headstock . Boy I wrong . The picture misleading . This thing tiny barely goes across three string . It wedges two strings put two picks ( maybe thin ) wedges top . Stays place well negative I n't know long hold . I think maybe thicker rubber rather foam rubber would held better . I see thing eventually losing tension pick holder wedges dropping picks . I really like things . I n't stick tape stuff guitar body make double sided tape similar post notes might good idea . Bought back bought . If drop pick another right . Have fun . I love idea n't need pocket strap elsewhere store pick . Further add something else pants pocket . 's good think bit expensive one give two price lower price 's stay well , moves much even go pick lightly could redeisigned . After buying product , I concluded $ 8.00 lot money foam ! Does job , I think velcro job would preferable one . Excellent simple product . Fits guitars stays way playing . Easily holds 2 picks time end . Has grooves ends one slide least 2 strings fit grooves . Since I bought little gadgets everybody playing guitar around want them.I use misplace picks time playing I look around longer I know find . I like use different gage picks therefore . I ordered Christmas stocking stuffers whicdh enjoyed friends . It 's lot smaller picture makes look , 's good thing . It serves purpose fits snugly strings headstock . I 'm using right acoustic job respect holding picks . It smaller I would pictured , still good product . It hold light heavy picks super easy put take . Only problem I moves lot putting pick back . Besides , highly recommendable anyone . I definitely pick axes . Not much say , 's made foam , made slip strings , made hold two picks . I several , acoustics electrics . My son lost one performance stage secure wo n't dislodged , still , stay majority time . I recommend . My son 's guitar teacher calls `` fancy little pick holder '' I 've people ask buy one see first time . One must also careful , son lost one I know possibility falling . He lost performing play stage.Please click YES review helpful , encourage continue writing updating reviews , leave comment questions , I happy answer I help . I use hold picks acoustic guitar . Got tired losing picks mid jam , digging pockets , scavenging another pick . Now 's right . I using months 5-string bass . I think even useful bassists guitar , I often find playing fingers , suddenly `` pick song '' starts ... 's pick ? I usually offset , tuner placement I fit one pick , I still find indispensable . And tape sticky stuff ! There also model made specially bass . [ Updated ] I bass model basses . It definitely better thicker strings.The guitar model Gibson . I love , `` spreading strings '' headstock makes less secure perfect . So , still highly recommended headstock `` straight '' design , much jackson radically angled headstock . ( They make Metal Edition . : ) ) This thing supposed , use practice bass since use type picks , supposed I thinking may affect ability tune properly , seems affect . Super audiophile tone might say affects resonance sustain , take recording . Very handy two picks times . It 's great make trip back mike stand get pick attach something sticky tape guitar 's finish . Me likey ! ! Price ca n't beat either ! I bought one try Junior lap steel guitar hold two finger picks thumb pick . Worked , difficult getting three picks one Wedgie I ordered second one . Between two , strings next nut , works pretty good holding types picks ( admittedly , Wedgie actually designed ) . Liked much I ordered two acoustic electric guitar one bass ( bass version ) . Only side I see -- DO seem loose like could fall AND I doubt picks stay place I case guitar ( n't tried yet ) . But otherwise , worth price good around . Especially lap steel need place stick finger picks guitar ( real help staying organized ! ) .

435	I bought two sets two Fender 4x10 bass cabinets . I slipped right using original Fender screws since 're machine screws ( EB comes wood screws ) . Very solid . drill wood 5/8 wood drill bit , I bought mine amp 1/4 stack I record I simple roll head Cabinet small room record ... get 4 package 4 wheels 4 retainers thats 5/8 & # 34 ; thick goes wood cabinet ... . Quality casters would expect Ernie Ball products , great , easy install hold tight sockets roll smoothly hard surfaces , intended used turf loose surfaces . I several bass cabinets , also remove easily stationary cabinet use . My Hartke Cabinet designed idiot ... million pounds casters ... even holes . Who invented thing , ? Anyways , I bought casters , got drill , punched holes bottom amp , pounded , . Sadly one holes wasnt drilled quite straight making one bit crooked amp veers right I push like car missing wheel . But still better carrying beast everywhere band playing . Of course , practice drummer 's house basement I still carry stairs , 's life . Great quality casters money ! Just good better quality ones come stock amps . You ca n't go wrong . 
436	I one setting I like , button knob I use turn . Would never use record , price 100 % awesome choice ! Totally sufficient live situation amp n't reverb , want easily turn reverb . sounds great . Love sound pedal quirks . It work well daisy chain power supply . set second channel distort bit . Forget batteries . They last 5-10 minutes . With power supply sounds amazing esp one takes consideration price Reverb effects cheap I budget I got particular one . The balance quality price good . The depth sound sounds great . I love options get pedal . The package comes bunch stickers I thought kind cool . My newest amp ( Marshall Joe Satriani ) replaced reverb noise gates ... function I absolutely love . But I needed reverb pedal . Honestly , expensive pedals , exactly lot less money . Give try . I 've using weeks I 'm extremely happy . I 6 amps . One good tube amp , digital reverb . It fails sound right . So . I researched reverb pedals found Biyang Reverb best design , tone , value market . I wrong . Have unit well month still amazing produces lacking one amp 's excuse reverb.This device , 's three different reverb settings , right style music play . The spring setting really quite real trails n't happen digital device . Analog warmth digital fails produce . The hall setting wonderful . Rich , powering . The A/B switch kinda nice touch . Much like bright switch presence . And fact stereo icing resides board , I grown use even amps I built good reverb . I 'm great sound Biyang I use nearly every amp I . It 's good . I sure wish I could afford Fender Twin Reverb old spring reverb ... I n't funds , I n't back lug one around anymore . So Baby Boom trick ! ! It 's close enough needs ! Did n't want spend $ 150 reverb gave try . Nice unit . spring reverb accurately . Playing tube amp sounds like spring amp Fender . For price ca n't go wrong . I ordered one bad boys whim . It 's definitely best verb 's price range . You dial pretty lush tones.It 3 way toggle , changes hall , spring room verbs.There 'd also a/b switch almost tone mode . A bright face , B lush settings go electro harmonix holy grail fender spring reverb.Also blend knob , controls wet dry signal mix , time knob controls , guessed reverb time versatile.This pedal built great construction , though first one I received faulty . All sorts popping weird stuff going on.The 2nd one works flawlessly . Seems durable , switch jacks quality.I highly recommend getting 9v adapter b/c thing drains batter power FAST , though modulation pedals pedal suck tone , true bypass , though I wish n't , I wish reverb trails avail effect turned & lt ; $ 75 shipped I certainly ca n't hesitations Biyang stuff , I definitely recommend . Nice reverb . Can get reverb sounds want . Got play I got dialed easy I 've using nearly year . I going buy Boss I somehow discovered Biyang . I never heard , 1/3 price Boss AND stereo , I gave try I n't looked back . The 3 modes nice . I leave mine set hall I 've never liked spring reverb , spring setting pedal sound exactly like spring reverb . The decay time mode enough probably anybody , I say blend control . Overall , great pedal lots sounds suit style playing . More enough decay wetness . Seems well-built . I 've since bought Biyang pedals I never issues like reviewers stated . I 'm ashamed Chinese clones board . In fact , I highly recommend Biyang whenever somebody asks . Well I n't expect much due price ... But trust thing really good ... I 've tried EH nano grail . I grail . I 've heard boss verbs . And I really like one . Save money pedal good enough ... I 'll make video post soon ... This actually first experience Biyang pedal . I heard good things build quality , n't end Biyang I needed reverb pedal . Turns reverb relatively expensive effect find compact pedal . Most popular options $ 100 up.At around $ , distinct advantage price , n't underestimate quality . As reviewers noted , reverb get EXTREMELY deep lush , desire . I found `` '' `` Time '' knobs around 30 % practical spring reverb . There 's Hall , Spring , Room . There subtle differences three , I 'd lying I said sounded dramatically different . The A/B switch n't well explained , 're `` A '' mode , effect much dramatic . I found operating `` B '' mode similar type reverb I enjoyed amps . ( Note : stereo input output , I use one , I ca n't comment ) end day , 's fairly simple `` always-on '' effect , Biyang job without costing fortune . But makes 5-star worthy book little pieces attention quality . Having thumb open 9V compartment ( instead plastic door needing Phillips screwdriver ) big deal . Also love 9V jack top unit , away jacks . The pots smooth easy turn , footswitch `` boutique '' level quality . This great reverb pedal - I n't think I 'll ever need another one .

438	Excellent tuner . I appreciate 's compact size often leave attached headstock . It performs appears quite durable . Being able angle unit great . The back light works well dim light course piezo mode makes tuning noisey quite easy . They mean say replace battery get . Mine lasted couple weeks . It tell need upfront . All well worth money transaction went flawlessly . Was looking something slightly improved Snark , still easier use lower cost strobe tuner.Works well quickly tune still zero correct tuner AW2 G ( guitar ) function clip fits guitar anticipated . Easy get last bit fine tuning . I could happier . Once catch ambient sounds , I love tuner . It eat battery power , keeps tuned right ! ! ! A bit better Snark , love saying SNARK . Just get snark ! ! ! ! Very accurate . When I wanted G I got G. I refined ear , I around I head cold , know , n't want show , 's good tuner . Easy use , accurate , programmable , lights , easy read , decent quality . I like , Korg never disappointed . It fits well Les Paul Strat . Does Not fly head playing . It 's easy read without back light depending room ambient lighting . The light works really well I looking . As far accuracy 's right either setting . 
439	Great sound sensitivity . Very well made . These last lifetime barring physical damage . Made USA boot ! These may cheapest worth every penny ! wires definatly change sound snare , improving sound , well looks . satisfied purchase Shipped fast , sounds great price way better lot places know Perfect chain rock sounds.Get 28 strand thicker snap.I might try next year . I 'm pretty happy one right now.The place I live corrosive air though messed chains . This excellent Snare Wire , used replace old noisy snare wire rattled old Pearl Snare Drum , quick easy replace , came straps secure use I prefer string . snare sound 100 % , rattle , snare fat tight crisp sound , well made product trick . Product came simple clear read instructions pictures , follow instructions strand work perfect . Great Product excellent price . 
440	I simply love cradle Jim Dunlop ( although little pricey ) . First , material neck rests soft . Overall bigger appears gives warm fuzzies know guitar wo n't fall skimpy little 3 legged arrangement sold elsewhere Planet . I find little short support Ovation Acoustic Bass , small length 2 x 4 fixed . Second , nice rotates support front fretboard guitar face I need get back guts side Ovation . Very good useful device . Very solidly built designed , well . Definitely holds guitar well . little pricey probably worth . I 'm fan Dunlop general think got right one . The Dunlop neck cradle well designed firmly supports neck guitar . It self adjusting makes restringing breeze ! Buy one , I sure like well I . This I needed many years . Really well made , sturdy last forever , useful Guitar work I need . I think reasonably priced well . Thanks great product good prompt service Cheers ! ! ! I impressed sturdiness size neck cradle . Combined work mat I purchased I turn almost table bench handy guitar workstation . In experience Jim Dunlop always makes good products one continues tradition . 
441	It definitely changes sound Classical Guitar better ( ) . It allows bass notes distinct upper note takes away fundamental . My initial thought away `` '' low bass mid-range response balanced entire spectrum guitar 's range . Amazing $ 20 piece plastic . Highly recommended . Actually , really easy string put ! felt volume coming sound hole bigger tone , n't know.. maybe im dumb enough notice I use guitar sounded horrible thing . It pain take , . However , got new lease life new guild guitar . It stop feedback issues sounded somewhat better overall . I cut part volume tone control located sound hole . Something might want think getting one . For years I fell love Yamaha . , nylon acoustic guitars weird sound played open spaces without using piezo ( note : change better piezo system , LR Baggs great ! ) , high notes lost thin air covered lower notes . I wanted experiment item ... result : GREAT ! ! ! I finally got listen I use heard recordings controlled environments . The sound richer clarity makes unique . Let first start sizing . When say `` Fits '' - 35 '' '' , really mean it.You going hard time trying fit even 1/16 '' smaller specifications.I know I . My friend 's Oscar Schmidt 3/4 sized guitar much smaller fit well . The edges `` catch '' completely looks terrible.My classical guitar similarly sized soundhole much wider fretboard edge soundhole , fit . You could try cutting edges main issue sound.Yes , make sound fuller strumming , slightly enough tell.However , expense sustain harmonic sound nice , even though guitar noticeably better bass , justify simple bone saddle way better cost thing I found Amazon stuff others return - resell brand new looks brand new.The packaging mine came slightly torn looked opened . Does matter ? In practical terms , , sort item.I guess Amazon keeps prices low yet good customer service return policies . This great I needed actual sound-hole cover . I bought along Planet Waves sound-hole cover . Though using short time I notice bottom end seemed focused . While sound improvement huge guitar , n't need . When comes music , & # 34 ; little extra & # 34 ; makes difference . The Planet Waves gives extra . I doubt continue please many , many years come . This says . Anything better rubber plug soundhole . This easy install , I strings inserted port . My Washburn never leave home without one . I installed one Larrivee created focused pleasing bass response reduced feedback amplified . I tried one Breedlove Custom OM poor results . I believe Breedlove 's inherent bass response supposed accomplish . In cases , I cut slots pickup controls takes little time care neatly . I think , 20 bucks worth shot , n't expect miracles . - Put Gibson J-45 . It increase bass ( OK , 's J-45 's strength ) ruined wonderful clarity balance guitars . Also took little finish sound-hole I removed it.- Tried Martin D-28 . Nope . The bass got muddier , definitely way go At point , going return , finally tried small body . Now THIS worked GREAT . , focused projects much better - almost resonator-like . Fantastic slide capo 'd high . That 's 's home ... An O-Port help guitar needs help - small body cheap guitar . In sample 2 , made high-end guitars sound worse . If ca n't afford better guitar , may worth try . But , careful , chip finish sound-hole . Perhaps may something worth one finer made guitars probably subtract add sound . Be advised I use front microphone perhaps shape internal plastic cone might something like sound mike . As strictly issue natural acoustics , I found sound way seemed decrease guitar 's output resonance . I Aria well-made Chinese attempt cloning Martin . It compete real Martin money I paid great buy known `` sound '' 's great natural volume . Adding O-Port deadened lows . It n't provide plus anywhere else . It however pretty inexpensive 're nut nuance want try 's going break bank . But , one better makes guitar real person `` voiced '' manufacturing process , plastic gizmo likely subtract add anything . I 'm acoustic nut I 'd love sound port side guitar hear everything goes inside box . The seemed `` '' sound shoot plastic horn allowing hear resonance sound bouncing back back sides sound hole . Sorry -- I like Planet Waves stuff good personally `` Humidipak '' recall years back . But product waste . Not sure improve sound . I fender dreadnought acoustic I could n't really tell much . Maybe little . Very pleased item . It really gives guitar richer mid sound definitely picks bottom . Definitely projects sound sound hole . 
442	I bought stratocaster build works perfectly . The holes lined , felt sturdy , genuine fender n't completely black though . There white stripe running around outer edge . Not problem , may . A genuine Fender part looks great MIM Strat . Good price arrived quickly well . I swapped pickguard American Standard black one I figured I 'd change back plate well . While nobody really sees back , drives nuts front back n't match . Because I n't want go without back plate , people like , I picked one . The holes lined perfectly literally takes less minute install . You ca n't go wrong genuine Fender parts . Not much say one . It 's genuine fender trem cover , job well . received , nicely packaged protective film . Little bit fiddling get holes lined , overall nice part . Compliments pickgaurd nicely . Open slot back much convenient series holes , normally found . The screw holes shade guitar , would think would want standardize n't carry many parts . Nope , n't fit Squire Affinity , FYI . Fit MIM strat perfectly , much else say . Always buy Fender parts Fender guitars , dont cheap order china copies ebay , wont fit . 
443	For money ( CHEAP ! ) , worth getting . The loop feature quite good , delay/echo entirely satisfactory . Not good , say , BOSS unit , cost 5x much . Great everything slapback long delay , repeats available . The plastic housing might stand-up road . Having 9v adapter input side behind jack , rather back , seems wise . I 've read negative press Behringer pedals , personally complain . delay . I found adjustment knobs made little effect pedal . The thing changes guitar tone pretty drastically . Made tone thin tinny . Pretty much straight clone Boss pedal- decent one . Not bulletproof construction boss sure , functions . This true bypass neither Boss . I experienced tone-suck buzzing others complained . Mine worked flawlessly box great job thickening leads Gilmour EJ way . Is best digital delay market ? Surely , 's best cheap one . The pedal features 2 seconds delay tap tempo function , however instructions tell engage tap function ( hold pedal ) . Believe , figure price point . If want spend double price ( $ still cheap ) , I would suggest Ibanez DE7 . Incidentally- pedal- like digital delay digital reverb- batteries . It 's , flaw related specific pedal . daisy chain ( like ... ) If pedal train multiple stomp boxes running via 9 volt 's no-brainer . price options u beat pedal , sound great acoustic electric guitar . thank u guys pedals really kick butt ! I bought occasional use guitar , mostly collected dust . But ... Sometimes I play guitar band I mix stage , vocalist likes little slappy echo voice , songs likes delay ... I figured experiment order.I ran 2 20 ' cables , one aux board delay input , delay output open channel board . I turned level `` max '' , dialed really wet signal monitors FOH . I let kick pedal night ... I concentrate playing whether I forgot stupid delay . Win ! And sounds pretty darned good , I shaved little treble channel n't get `` way '' , almost like analog quality . Good stuff . n't know much delay I 've never really used . This fun pedal , simple cool delay . Kinda makes aware playing . Fun sound ! Yep ! well Behringer ! ! ! , , say electronics german mind , , says , , go figure , , ! ! .. plastic give 4 stars , cuz soft plastic case , trouble changing batteries , , u use charger u well sound really awesome money , high standard delay time sound , , n't think u get german quality anywhere else 30 bucks , , say buy great delay pedal , , delay Behringer effects sounding great money , , go wrong.. This Behringer DD400 delay unit lot great features . I particularly like stereo outputs allow user send delayed signal separate amplifier dramatic stereo effect . The extra-long 1300 delay great Pink Gilmour style solos . The shorter delay settings allow rockabilly slap back effects , although I hardly ever play style , n't matter much me.Here 's gets weird : I tested unit using vintage Fender tube amp primary signal Vox amp delayed signal . As long I played loudly , everything worked quite well . However , I set guitar moment , I started hearing voices . Yes , voices ! The delay unit picking radio frequency interference la Jimi Hendrix . I idea HOW , I could clearly hear sort radio transmission like family band radio . The interference went away design , I n't buy `` German innovation '' advertising line Behringer . This obviously cheap Chinese copy legendary Boss DD-7 costs four times much . If want really good quality , buy Boss unit ! If get buy fairly cheap delay unit talks time time , Behringer ok . usual another good piece behringer I use guitars also real good sound adaptable buy products usual purchases amazon quality stuff good prices efficient fast delivery times WOW ! ! ! ! ! thing fun play ! ! ! first delay pedal , cant compare others , im happy bought ! ive month played hours every day . tweak echo 100 's different ways.the case seems sturdy looks like last quite long dont get zelous stomp hard . im happy product im becoming real fan behringer products . If want U2 kind sounds good entry type sound . Thing dont like poping sound tunr time knob . For price home use good pedal someone budget . originally wanted Boss DD , side side demo , decided 'm n't need 150 dollar pedal intro stuff . I Berhinger Reverb Machine equal ... ..no equal Boss counterparts . Especially looking unique sound n't stock Boss . would n't take road anything without 3 4 backups , recording demos way go , timed effects wise anyway . made plastic . This Behringer unit necessary features give solid performance stompbox delay pedal . I say , pay ?

446	mat $ neoprene ( kind ) mat , neck holder thing inserted tube contain mat ... TAKE IT OUT carefully , I careful base neck holder broke bit ... In opinion thing priced $ 15 $ 20 less really worth Man Say : Do favor , use long pillow desk tune up/intonate Strat Tele use $ $ buy good strings ! : D It works ! This guitar support could n't simpler . The neck rest molded plastic cup soft spongy material inside neck support . The mat thick light weight foam mat ( bit like yoga mat ) hole cut . The neck support cup goes hole . That 's set . The mat protects guitar body . The support cup holds guitar exactly right angle work , change strings , adjust truss rod , work pickups , clean guitar . The guitar placed strings would n't difficult DIY project , I 'd missing cool Fender logo I made wood yoga mat . Honestly , looks really sharp put together.The whole thing comes packaged clear plastic tube . That tube excellent storage tube . This simple tool helps protect guitar scratches I 'm changing strings , cleaning . It 's foam cushion neck supporter . It rolls together small convenient plastic tube storage . Well worth . The description says I still wondering I made right choice I comparing `` Fender Accessories Guitar Tools '' heck kind name anyway ? ! - NO reviews theJim Dunlop Formula 65 Neck Maintenance pretty good reviews.Well , I speak Dunlop I say kit light weight , self-contained , storage space , works guitar face also pad keep guitar sliding - pad keeps neck rest place topple ! I see anything like mentioned Dunlop top , I think neck rest & pad Setup & Maintenance - Instructional Guitar DVD With one turned `` Fender '' logo showing ... This product makes changing strings guitar easy ; must anyone type guitar . It basically thing sold made major brands guitars . It holds guitar secure changing strings making adjustments . It also easy store finished . Yes product simple expensive enough raise . But tool well designed . It keeps guitar sliding positions nice angle maintenance . In storage mode , mat rolls clear plastic tube takes little space . The bottom cover doubles storage compartment hex wrenches , string winder , real reason I give product five stars allows work guitars keeping perfect condition . That increases resale value , tool pays . And gives lot pleasure right tools job . With right tools , I enjoy working guitars almost much playing . While I hear complaining high cost saying , I used paying higher prices good tools I think qualifies good tool . I used put new pickups setup Squier Stratocaster last night without damaging guitar . Without tool , I n't think I would lucky . If guitar use change strings worth investment . It protects guitar getting banged nicked . Supports neck guitar body perfectly perform work guitar . This must ! Really ! It pack well , I use everyday ! Please get one tried paying someone guitar setup . Long wait overpriced item . Arrived time 3 week wait . Overpriced expected Fender name product.. 
447	Definitely provided extra gripping surface . The pick extends rubber ' . Obviously thin pics thin thick ones lot stiffer . Since shell bit thicker normal pick may gotten used . I know I prefer grip pick really close tips harmonics fingers definitely n't slip 's bit pic I want . So I carry use occasionally n't everyday pick . I 've using yellow one far ( started using ) . But I like grip strong cause rubber grooves . The colors designs pretty . As far I tell width/thickness . For reason I thought 'd different thicknesses previous review .

The Dunlop picks bumps nice , feels lot better three little lines center pick , bottom line supposed less flex top line supposed flex . This really hard position fingers exactly spots n't much effect matter I place fingers . The effect subtle criticism tip little bit short ; rubber end striking string.Overall , I like picks lot . The colors cool rubber feels really good hand . For 30 yrs . playing finger style - usually alternating bass , never really used pick seemed like good first choice.For song I performing , chords , E , F # , G ( 1st & 3rd position ) I needed back singer really strumming tiny bit playing first two strings found old thin Peavey pick unintentionally picking looked like blue Dava bottom guitar case worked perfectly I ordered Fender Abalone Thin picks find make playing chords quite 351 Premium Celluloid Guitar Picks , 12 Pack , Abalone , ancient Peavey broke half long , I continued using stub turned sideways waiting new Fender picks arrive I liked extra flex ) Seems like advanced players like least medium better pick individual strings , since I never liked using pick , Fender Thin works best I 'm enjoying learning use songs like Eric Clapton 's Smith 's `` You ... '' I 'll try Dava picks later I feel need . I play 's version Fair exclusively finger picking George 's `` Here Comes Sun '' - uses pick , still easier pick individual notes acoustic 6 string steel guitar , using D'Addario EJ16 Phosphor Bronze light strings.Bristol Blueridge BD-16 Dreadnaught Acoustic Guitar ( Natural ) D'Addario EJ16 Phosphor Bronze Acoustic Guitar Strings , rank beginner never picked pick , Fender thin makes easier strum pick flexes 's essential turn wrist much get pick move smoothly strings.The grip better Dava , n't going flex much . Undoubtedly better accomplished players . Most advice I 've seen says try 'em decide . I amazed delighted much easier Fender thin made get started . I tryed number pick 's textured ones seem work .

The grip exceptional look sort cool . I got six probably get wear . I doubt I lose . I take makes hands shake ; therefore , I difficult time fine muscle movements . I switched Dunlop Jazz III 's , I loved , puppies great feel n't worry dropping . They also bigger Jazz III 's , making bit easier hold . In attempt see 's new pick industry , I decided dive give go . They way flimsy , like , use heavier pick . I always used Dunlop Tortex Davas ca n't compete . Not flimsy , I played aggression ( heavy rock-based material ) , picks would fly hands . This huge disappointment . I love concept design picks save one rubber gripping goes far pick . I n't know guitar players thumb entire pick , since goes far 's hard pick clean without hitting rubber strings sometimes . I love bend middle grippy rubber I think scale rubberization back little bit . Good grip , flexible , description says nothing thickness flexibility picks . Probably good strumming , good lead . I always trouble holding onto picks . My fingers could n't extended play . Nothing worse shaking pick body ! LOL . I wish I would thought . They I needed . They work great . I still searching pick replace ones I left somewhere . I knew ones I sought , great . They n't move around hand , I yet drop one , first time I noticed pick make difference sound guitar .

I really like using pick acoustic nylon string guitar . The rubber makes easy hold onto I feel good sound guitar well . These picks kind thin , flexible , good rubber grip . They 're good speed-picking strumming . The complaint I 're thin . The pack brings 6 picks . If 're looking thin , flexible picks good grip , . The grip pretty great , I n't dropped I 've playing much better . They give nice crisp sound Elixir nanoweb strings . Dava 6024 Grip advertised . This first attempt playing mandolin I selected product . They work fine starter . I may learn different time goes along , assuming teach old dog new tricks saying goes . These amazing . I 'm intermediate player . Have last 30 years . I tend sweaty hands loose grip . Every pick I used turned fingers ... loose grip , little sweat , slick finish . Ok ... thin ? med ? heavy ? You choose stiffness hold pick . Incredible stiffness change depending hold . And I even hold onto . Very nice grip . I keep getting cuz everytime I hand one someone try , 's last time I see . Just hit Add cart . You wo n't sorry Picks one items taste 98 % works . That said I admit picks high quality . The design really pragmatic effective . I recently introduced student mine I say first time 15+ years I changed picks.I used dunlop made Lexan material I found perfect came along . Sometimes change good ! We need open . 
448	Last forever easy hold onto . Not much say really isnt much needs said . My favorite picks . Great round pick , one favorites . Easy grip pretty quite . They wear extremely fast though . I recently bought bunch picks different gauges materials shoot . I think see kind tone looking - yes , even pick ( sorry guys ! - , material gauge full sound , without thin material feels best fingers . ( I previously used gauge Claytons . I like pics . I use variety thickness moderately thin . good fast strumming , etc . feel good hand easy hold onto . I would buy . Years ago I used Clayton & # 34 ; small teardrop & # 34 ; picks . I could n't tell picture , full size , I n't check size description . I still small ones , I used templates , cut . I would rated higher , I could used . It 's fault looking specifications . I purchased two six packs Clayton picks , found Dunlop 0.60mm ( Orange ) Tortex Small Drop Guitar Picks , lot cheaper . Clayton 's rule ! Been using since never change anything lasting great tone , 
449	Could tapered tiny pick . But material AWESOME . Nice grip even I sweat . I play metal I need strong pick ( Jazz III models ) one also texture ( Ultex ) makes easier hold right position . Second time I bought . The yellow material rough texture coated gives nice rubbery grip smooth snappy tone ! Nice picks . A bit small preference . Great picking , kind harsh strumming , Quality seems top-notch . Some guitarists love . I moved Carbon Fiber Lexan Jazz III picks Ultex picks also nice . They little less bright Carbon Fiber Picks cases actually preferrable . In opinion ( At least moment ) Jazz III picks right top list best picks buy . Once get used small size going back . The large picks feel like holding refrigerator . This Ultex Jazz 3 's cool , durability high I 'm feel comfortable play ... If fan Jazz III definitely like Ultex version . From experience , Ultex sound feel Tortex without `` memory '' aka wear . The Ultex thicker standard Jazz III 's directly compared notice Ultex version slightly larger gripping surface.Five stars better Jazz III . However , prices amazon . I got mine around $ 2 shipped . I already liked Jazz 3 picks Dunlop , made Ultex material sound much better , surface pick nice , even sweaty fingers , stay put . I pick scrapes alot sign wear edges pick . Sweet ! ! ! ! ! These clear yellow picks I would love see red , would brutal ! ! ! ! IDK GC carry . . Great pick ! Worth buying baggie . If like ultex feel hate store larger ones , get . Firm pick , perfect size keeps sharp tip . Once try picks never go back . This nice pick , thicker easy hold . I like size ( smaller regular picks ) tone allows obtain guitar . A nice pick , feel texture ( design bit boring , though ) . Only complaint 's fairly small - size Canadian US five cent piece , typical guitar pick bigger - size 25 cent piece . But 's okay . I got time I got set Dava Jazz Grip 9024 red picks Dunlop Max Grip Jazz III Carbon Fiber Guitar Picks , I think I like Dava picks best . All three & # 34 ; tight grip & # 34 ; picks , size - 're good , though - I 'd rate one next-best , Jazz III Carbon Fiber next ) . Great picks , Jazz though . I play pretty much everything work really well styles . Takes little getting used smaller size feel , fantastic . ever since I saw vid mark tremonti says heard lot musicians used Jazz 3 picks , tried simply could n't use pick.. I decided try out.. I fell instantly love regular jazz III picks ! I always issues holding picks keeping & # 34 ; put & # 34 ; played jazz III exception n't bother I n't really feel like problem , problem ... Then I read new Ultex thingyit looked like jazz III every one seemed like I figured go ... I skeptical & # 34 ; impossible drop & # 34 ; thing I read..so feel ... Well tried playing I n't even notice I n't readjusted pick ... .. NOT ... like pick.. started paying closer realized thing really ... stays ... 's freaking incredible ! holy @ # $ @ % # wow ! I love thing love love ! 
450	Nice thick , adhesive strong . I used microphone electronics shield RF noise . If n't shielding grounded , continuous loop , wo n't work . If hear hum , 's shielding , 's technique . You really need double quantity charge accordingly . The single order n't really enough one guitar I doubt could bass , either . I used copper clear pickguard , matched rest guitar pretty closely . Then , I finished pickguard compartment jack area aluminum foil tape local hardware store . This best thing I done Telecaster . I noise , even moderate volumes . After shielding , absolutely quiet . This peel stick tape conductive glue , n't solder overlap joints . I overlapped 1/4 & # 34 ; 3 1/2 & # 34 ; X 8 & # 34 ; piece left shielding two humbucking pickups control cavity . The tape easy use , sticks well inside strong ( I n't break tear pieces ) . I definitely using product next guitar build . There probably enough tape two telecasters single coil pickups . If electric guitar noisy crackly need tape shield , even humbuckers guitar picking noise , interference , I installed copper tape sound guitar sweet sweet music , hum , noise , crackling etc . overall excellent buy Great product ! Easy use I able shield entire Jazz Bass . It would nice get little though , since JUST enough .

452	n't want read whole thing : This worth money . If 're beginner looking first guitar 're experienced searching option anything like , get . Do hesitate . A cheap guitar n't ALWAYS mean POS ! Alright , full story/review : So , I kid early teens ( insanely talented self-taught ) older brother helped learn play guitar . I got pretty decent somewhere along way I stopped I 've regretted basically every day ever since . Recently , I decided stop internally realized I actually DO something . So , I previously lived house multiple guitarists , I heard sounds expensive guitars I heard sounds cheapest guitars ( like typical beginner 's First Act ) . I knew middle ground I determined find . I got way I bargained for.I began quest knowing funds limited . There way I could afford dive right buy high end , top line Fender Martin like I benefit learning back day . I knew I go cheap , least . I began scouring internet search best rated budget guitars . After exhaustive amount research , I chose one due positive reviews demos I 'd pulled YouTube excellent . Plus , Epiphone pretty good reputation positive reviews , I still bit leery ; buying instruments without actually handling first always bit gamble . Even sounds nice plays well , sometimes perfectly solid , functional instrument n't FEEL right . As I went I silently reminded I could send back reason . I went fully knowing good possibility I 'd bite bullet buy something better , even , arrived earlier week I disappointed . I certainly n't expect perfection I convinced I would find kind error , cosmetic , cheap guitar . I tell I found anything wrong . Even I ( unless drastically affected sound/playability instrument ) , would still worth price.Along guitar I bought new strings ( Martins ) times stock strings come instruments awful . I pleasantly surprised find stock strings usable . I see reviewers disagree . Maybe strings older maybe 's preference , I n't know . All I say stock strings guitar . enough , guitar pretty close tune right box ! It n't seem trouble staying tune , either . All said , would n't hurt pick pack strings safe . I mean , I 'm sure I finally put Martins I 'll even I already way sounds.This guitar full , rich sound , plays comfortably ( low action helps ! ) , zero issues buzzing dead frets . Oh , contrary reviews said - YES , DOES truss rod . While 're talking positives , let 's ignore fact 's also super attractive shiny black finish . There n't much would give away price . No , 's $ 1000 guitar certainly n't play like $ 100 guitar either ! I n't regret purchase . Even future I progress upgrade I definitely keeping lovely gem ! If 're still unsure , I listen demos YouTube . I doubt 'll disappointed . ( Pay mind reviews guy YouTube channel .

The hardware much higher quality I expected far . The strings came n't complete crap , I swapped favorite set strings : Ernie Ball Nylon Black Silver Classical strings . The guitar sings beautifully ; tone rich vibrant.It 's quite comfortable play , I problems playing 16th fret without guitar cut away . I 'm big fan pick guard Epiphone ' E ' , I probably end removing ; sunburst really nice looking . I received many compliments look ALL : guitar really great instrument price tag . GET IT ! Also ; I 'm buying hard case take home , shipping guitar back home I want keep part collection . My original thought buy guitar leave Rec tent people use I 'm gone . Even I decide leave ; I 'll buying another one I get home ! This NOT first guitar . Nor I Epiphone supporter shouting guitar sonic equal Taylors Martins . It 's . Here 's : An exceedingly well-constucted , AMAZINGLY playable guitar . Fit , finish , feel action VERY nice ... Sound hand ? Let 's face . It 's plywood around . It SOUNDS like plywood . But n't distract fact 's great guitar $ 100 bucks.It 's fine & # 34 ; first & # 34 ; guitar . It 's great guitar . Leave car practice lunch . Leave office . ANY guitar better guitar ... And guitar better LOT entry level consider changing strings second take box ... New , premium strings DO make difference.If expectations playable , rugged , affordable guitar wo n't disappointed .

456	Bought mic daughter using alot . Great quality money works well . Mic described . I playing singing close 20 years currently host open mic local coffee shop . I used lots great equipment mics including mentioned sm57 sm58 . While I either one a/b comparison - I DID 2 high-end ( $ 100 mics ) compare . One EV rather costly older Peavey . These mics compared favorably slighter flatter frequency response . The signal quite hot EV Peavey , far resistant feedback - even turned match hotter volumes 2 . Ca n't speak longevity reliability yet , seems sturdy nice performing piece musical equipment . I feel mics compare favorably anything 150 bucks . Great value & highly recommended . best mic quality price . perhaps par brands much buy another one . I like mic much . It sounds nice vocals seems well made . I use professional capacity though certainly seems well enough made stand plenty use . Excellent mic , rugged great sound zero extraneous on/off switch bit disappointing . love perfect microphone karaoke mobile DJ live use provide live entertainment I love reception perfect recommend First NOT best microphone ever made . But cost certainly I expected . I give 4 stars microphone period , without even taking low cost consideration . They much better next cheapest thing worth extra $ 5 sure . I bought one Behringer XM8500 two couple months later planning use rehearsal microphones band start 5 years go . However , actually used vocals live performances sound tech 's personal SM-58 's busy another job . I honestly think sound either way maybe little clearer Behringers . At one time Alice band using Behringer XM8500 's , however may moved I Shure SM-58 clones even though appear cosmetic knockoffs . They slightly hotter output flat response ears Shure 's pronounced lower mid boost makes male voice sound bigger sometimes distorted correctly . They ideal backup vocal microphone since Behringer behaves like compromise microphone tailored male voice microphone tailored female voice actually works well without heavy eq . It also anything versatile SM-58 useful acoustic instrument pickup microphone working anything would ordinarily use SM-57 pick . It n't overload easily , high output tight pattern feedback rejection SM-58 . It reasonably decent blast filter , using outdoor instrument pickup n't add windscreen . Another strength durability . My 3 sustained numerous drops , couple falls happened boom stand mounted microphone fall weight boom stand behind adding mass force fall . No damage ! I used cringe fell got dropped I shrug . One weak point sensitive handling noise , stand handling noise issue . Mine came hard plastic foam lined cases stand adapters . The stand adapters sort flimsy usable . If want SM-58 's need buy SM-58 's . If want good around microphone $ 20 $ 40 class try one . No on-off switch switches SM-58 's use frankly on-off switch liability ! I n't think find better microphone new money recommend decent all-around microphone price . You pay get less . Bought sing karaoke YouTube . Also cousins use practicing using condenser microphone home studio recordings focusrite 2i2 interface . cousin I perform live house parties events entertain crowd . So something necessary . waste money unwanted item . Also n't really use headphones dynamic microphone reduces loop back using skype playing video games talking friends , listen speakers . Nice mic - good quality , problems used heavy past year . Sounds identical Shure SM58 , MUCH less . I bought use 's Church . Works great . Has nice sound . Well made . It held kids using . Great value price . Works great especially price . Just put little highs mids eq , pretty close sm58 . It 's light great sound interviews . I would recomende mic station Z108.net visit us web hear live . Good microphone money , sounds little better AKG , knocked 4 stars due fact on/off switch . I user Behringer products though , 2 amps . This great quality microphone good price . Keep mind XLR , n't noticed . XLR better quality connections . It 's physical shape size rock band microphone ( Looking good comparison . ) , MUCH better quality . It 's flawless quality n't give feedback . I would recomment anyone , especially great price . I n't used mic much , yet , far great sound . It loud projects voice front music . For 25 bucks I n't think beat . I 'm happy far . I may buy . It `` short '' one reviewer complained . It standard length like SM-58 . I ordered two arrived within week . I tested , sound quite good majority reviewers said ( 's I bought ! ! ! ) . And solidly built , one pretty light microphone comes cheap karaoke n't expect come , cable OK me.Here BUT ... ... : ON/OFF switch , really pissed fault , I read 1 star review first.The photo shows ON/OFF switch , however catch seller seems trouble say `` product , ... '' It says product well , I got stuck two microphones without ON/OFF switch.I buy adapter on/off switch microphone . wow wow I ca n't believe working wonderful.I 'm using karaoke online somes I , 's perfect vocal.I connected mixer Alesis 8 wish 's built switch buyer . Thanks Amazon I professional touring recording artist , , typically sings beta 58 . I recently impressed Behringer 's products . Sometimes I run sound local festivals needed extra vocal mics . I read good reviews decided buy one . At $ 25 I figured I could chance ! I used place beta 58 recent show . The mic much hotter 58 , better bass response boosted highs right frequencies ! As far durability ... question , looking great mic n't cost $ 160 bucks ... mic ! I expecting so-so mike price , boy I surprised ! This mike great . One thing I notice n't fed mixer need low impedance filters keep thing buzzing , works great . This high quality microphone . Sounds really clear noise . Works great new mixer . Built sturdy metal plastic . Shipping great along packaging . This nice dynamic mic ! This nice microphone money general voice work.I would use mic professional singing , spoken word.I many microphones , compares $ 50 . range mics . I originally planning purchasing 2- 3 packs xm1800s , hearing difference xm1800 xm8500 looking get 5 vocal microphones budget band sings loads harmonies every song.I really wanted Sure SM58 & # 8217 ; , budget allow it.I normally stay away Behringer due bad experiences compressors etc. , microphones game changer me.They full even tone without mud extreme plosives , also excellent output level able EQ easily male female vocal ranges . I told 5 singers could loud clear also able get nice even mix front end.I know anything better price live vocal microphones right . This terrific value anyone wants something like Shure SM58 n't want lay $ 100 . I bought kind experiment . I 'm learning blues harp . I wanted try mikes could used combination vocals harmonic playing . For reason , mike one I could cup hands also mount stand . While Astatic JT-30 great shape crunchy sound harp players love , I ca n't ( easily ) mount stand use vocals.The spherical receiver makes XM8500 pretty easy cup hands . The torpedo body mounts easily OnStage boom mike stand . And low-impedance output feeds nicely guitar amps need preamping ( resulting noise signal loss ) .The mike n't perfect , low cost generally excellent construction make slight . Here couple casual . The mike picture looked bluish . What I actually received mike nice black . The product description seems report weight 8.5 ounces . I measured mike ounces . That gives substantial feel although mike still bit lighter similar dynamic mikes I 've used.3 . The mike 500 ohms impedance frequency response 16,000 Hz . prefer cut-off 10,000 give midrange boost , tweaking compensate extended range . The mike n't on-off switch , perhaps real deficiency . These switches really . In actual use , mike dos n't seem susceptible pops , . The mike comes pretty substantial hard-shell carrying case molded foam interior enough protection . I find smaller zippered case convenient mike suitcase , toting fair amount equipment around , storing home , oversized case work well.I hope helps . This great microphone . It fits easily recording equipment I 'm using . It heft I know 's going fall apart wimpy microphone . It gives great sounds . 
457	I 'm impressed EXP16 guitar strings . * What I dead sound non-coated strings replaced . Coated strings usually lack bright high-end brilliance uncoated light strings . * What I bright , yet twangy sound . When I put Light strings acoustic , I 'm going easy playability , , bright airy sound . These deliver counts . * coating strings supposed prolong time changes . So far holding tone brightness . I report back three months . My last set started sound dull , exhibit tone variation six months ( viewed sensitive tuner , seems dirtier strings detune sharp bit attack , harder strum . This confirmed fact sound tune get dirty ) . * ordering . I think perform well price . Love bright light gauge sound playability . I 've used D'Addario strings many , many years without problems - acoustic & electric . I 've tried coated strings past , I actually prefer Elixir feel like regular strings - wrap coated , rather sheathe placed entire string , like last longer ? Probably . Even I 'm situations I 'm gigging regularly I rarely change strings every months , I n't see need . I think main benefit coated strings guitars ca n't play regularly strings wo n't corrode . But sound great feel fine , 're least expensive coated strings I 've found . I 've always found D'Addario quality great . But unless new guitar , know . These strings expensive supposed last longer . Really , I ca n't tell . Or n't . They sound great , play great I usually purchase D'Addario Martin strings . Not sure I would pay future , I play average daily every day depending gets way . Change strings every couple months . Just home big deal , I performing I would go faster.I 'm giving 5 stars D'addario makes great strings . 'Nuff said . Good strings , though 1 use I didnt notice significant improvement standard phosphor bronze strings . probably best sounding guitar strings without breaking bank . I made last 2 months ... still decent sound . These great strings . They right length go easy enough . They color coded helps bunch getting right string right hole long n't color blind . They go , sound bright , keep new string sound bit longer uncoated strings . Had salesman tell coated strings last forever , change every 3 months . I reply forever n't last long used . Changing strings fun lifetime guitar 1/3 less , good deal even n't last forever . That means guitar playing less guitar stringing brainer book . Worth extra . I using EXPs time become go-to string . I find coating less noticeable tonal variations less string string set-to-set . Highly recommended . I 've using strings eight years , I also use two Taylor 's ( & I use mediums 710 ) I agree reviewer saying best sounding coated string . I still use Martin strings awhile , strings last improve sound get hours play them.Actually I three acoustics two Taylor 's right 're strung EXP 's . I know people want different sounds strings , I find bright great bottom , unlike Elixirs I find unbearably bright weak bottom end . These strings sound great great dynamics . Even Laguna Grand ( slightly larger Grand Concert ) pump lows sparkle highs . These Grand Auditorium thing , produce sound I demand make real positive improvement coated strings I 've used.The Mediums 710 endless bottom end still great range mid 's treble.As I said I still use Martin Phosphor Bronze strings awhile , honestly strings hold extremely well sound great . near near uncoated string 're going find . These D'Addario `` EXP16 Phosphor Bronze Light '' strings acoustic guitars produce decent sound designed last longer `` normal '' strings . We two beginner guitar players house hard strings , good choice us.We pleased way sound , feel , last , likely pick next time need replace strings.Recommended ! CFH Elixir coated strings far favorite strings acoustic guitar . D'Addario finally made string comparable maybe little tiny bit better nice bright strings . The coating incredibly subtle , almost impossible feel strings . I like . Compared Elixir 's bit brighter , good old school , I hate packaging . These strings packaged three two string loops inside single plastic bag . Ah , know I 'm used strings individually looped . Two strings looped together makes mess I 'm restringing guitar - I unwrap pair , I 've got string sit unwrapped bench . The neat freak . I also dislike strings one plastic bag . Yeah I get ; trying environmentally responsible . But darn , 6 paper envelopes ? It feels like trying packaging materials , environmental cause . 100 % post-consumer recycled paper adds little environmental know D'Addario loves color coded ends . On acoustic guitar 's irrelevant , ends hidden inside guitar behind pegs . On electric guitars , I n't like look . I prefer gold silver rings end . If strings individual labeled packages , 's need loves color coded end rings much , horrible job color coding simplifying packaging . I yet colors naming system.I normally use 10 gauge strings acoustic guitar . I tested 12 gauge surprised much I like . The slightly thicker string strings priced almost Elixir 's . My reason using original D'Addario strings low price - somebody gigs nightly , uncoated strings way go . Strings end changed long corrosion becomes issue gigging musician . For home enthusiast , coated strings make ton sense , last longer . I think worth premium price . Now two choices excellent coated strings.In end , packaging , color coded end rings , crazy package coding , double looped strings mean nothing strings guitar . What sound like play like important thing . And regard excellent strings . Play . easy fingers . Ca n't come close understanding differences different style strings work great My Taylor acoustic I acoustic guitar . With five six-string , I play every day , year 's time , I go lot strings . Over years , I come favor phosphor-bronze type seem add something rich warm tones good instrument . For long time , I believed brands interchangeable I bought whatever available best price . No . These D'Addarios sweetest , easiest play , important variable - longest lasting - phosphor bronze strings I used.There shelf unopened sets unopened Martins , Gibsons , GHS , Elixirs ( well varieties D'Addario strings . ) I think 's time sell . These EXP16s superior all.I small hands fingers terribly strong . To play well I able , I require strings respond touch tear fingers . Sound-wise , I look blend 'brightness ' ' strings thst punctuate qualities good guitar . These D'Addarios things well.Other reviewers somewhat critical ' strings - I simple experience . As ALL guitar strings , wiped dry , lint-free cloth every playing . Not quickly compromise accurate resonance vibrations ANY string . As bonus , price strings quite reasonable . I bought 6 sets plan use , Mediums Lights , stringed friends . The benefit coated strings , box says , longer life . This due natural finger oils corroding strings sapping natural `` life '' , i.e . brightness new strings . The drawbacks coated strings feel unnatural slippery depending coating - also latest rage guitar strings allow string manufacturers charge basic commodity strings.So good ? Yes , feel great , overly slippery coated , sound great , though appear muted tone strings . I 'm excited acoustic mostly electric player I change acoustic string less hoping coating fight grime build allow enjoy gauge . These light strings go .012 .053 compared old Martin 's went 0.012 summary , D'addario makes good strings exception . If 're looking coated acoustic strings muted ( opposed ) tone lighter low E , check . I recently sent two Ovations back factory re-work ( I plain wore ) , came back strings . As soon I took case strummed , I immediately called factory said `` thanks fantastic job guitars , way , best sounding strings I 've ever played , exactly ? '' I might experiment , large , EXPs new strings . I love company . D'addario makes grab product lasts long time . Ever since I switched brand strings , seem last longer make grab tone . I n't know 's guitar ( Taylor ) strings , I get great quality even months use . I definitely recommend product anyone plays acoustic guitar . I tried EXPs Gibson L4 archtop I play jazz single lines , small chord comping , full chords I Martin OM-1 figured I 'd get better overall feel tone response.For years I 've played Martin Phosphor Bronze mediums guitars 's reference : The D'Addario EXP lights show difference mostly bass end 're good 7 mm thinner . The high E B 3 mm less I feel enough bother . All things equal I prefer heavier strings tone I play instruments I n't trust truly heavy first thing I noticed considerably less `` new string clang '' compared Martins D'Addario 's regular bronze strings I 've used past still use still long way sounding broken-in , EXP strings sound though 've several days good use . As kid I much would rot strings like would n't believe - humid summer day I could get rid clang tension EXP 's feels comfortable considerably flexible 7 mm difference account . I like bend strings acoustic certain contexts , tough tight strings ; EXP 's feel easy - electric guitar easy mind , fine quality 's noticeable sustain . The strings I took n't completely dead I n't expecting dramatic difference , 's noticable across board , especially small chord comping three four strings time.The tone also feels bit balanced across six strings , admittedly subjective : I play differently shaped thicknessed picks different recording contexts ; generate percussive pick noise others ; sometimes I want , times . The response EXPs sounds consistent 've couple weeks , playing fairly regularly . Some initial clang gone ( desired ) bright lively tone suppose real test EXP coating sound beyond point strings begin sound dead . Maybe I 'll update review line , , 's false question strings n't sound feel good short term , cares last forever ! I love customs ... inbetween lights mediums ... get bright booming sound ... nice bends course , longer playing life ... I 've used guitars alittle darker sound wood used ... sound tad . I would recommend cedar mahagony body guitars blink eye . These strings last good long time rather inexpensive . tone clear bright . I used D'Addario years Personally I love D'Addario strings . They sute needs right Takamine acoustic . Great quality price . After playing years Elixir Nanoweb 80/20 's , I decided experiment different coated strings . I tried Elixir Nanoweb Phosphor Bronze , Dean Markley Alchemy Gold Phosphor ( discontinued ) EXP16s . Ultimately , I preferred Nanoweb Phosphor Bronze best , EXP16 cheaper difference n't warrant extra cost , I decided stick . I n't fan rough texture high tension . The EXP16s smooth playable tension , although smooth easy Elixir 80/20 's . As far longevity , seem last 2 months , par coated strings I 've tried , except Elixir 80/20 's average 3 months . strings last style play , I prefer brighter warmer strings , I 'd rank EXP16s somewhere middle . It 's good balance strumming fingerstyle . Even though n't project well Elixir 80/20s , agreeable tone without harsh overtones . For live use pickup I 'd inclined use Elixirs , unplugged use I like tone . Not sure brass side bronze ? Not really liking compared phospher bronze . The EXPs nice strings . They nice feel along less string noise . And last . My two acoustic guitars , Takamine Mini jumbo Gretsch jumbo , made mahogany nice sounding guitars . I figured would try 80/20 strings using phospher bronze . Only real problem noticed 80/20s seem brighter ring longer . I prefer warmer tone . And since guitars alot `` boom '' already , dont need extra ring sound overtones strumming fast . I imagine strings may work instances , going back phospher bronze guitars . I like Elixir . I try one another friend said 's ok cheaper.I tried quality low end.The sound gauge heavy fingers ( problem ) All 6 strings wrapped inside one single bag.I 'd go back Elixir next time . We old acoustic around house , I rarely play , opting instead electric . This going hard believe , strings acoustic last changed two decades put new strings guitar ( ) , sound , might imagine , incredible -- bright fairly pricey , I impressed quality . good deep tone acoustic guitars . easily stretched tuned problems . You go wrong D'Addario strings . D'Addario guitar strings strings . They last little longer always sound good Ovation guitars also acoustic guitars . I usually buy recommend others also . You go wrong strings play often . You notice longer life guitar certainly remained tuned . There two ways guitar strings go bad . If leave long enough , steel cores bronze windings actually takes months , . Before happens , grease fingers , dust , bits skin , environment gets strings , windings . This interferes free vibration strings deadens sound . Back strings lot expensive , guys used take strings guitar regularly clean even boil ; bass players still . Coated strings simpler strings similar ones like Elixirs thin polytetrafluoroethylene coating bonded wrappings , accomplishes two things : First , creates barrier atmosphere metal wrap , prevents rust corrosion . Second , provides physical barrier prevents contamination getting windings . The strings stay fresher sounding two three times long standard strings . They sound bit less bright equivalent uncoated strings , 's huge difference , month two still sound same.They also cost twice much equivalent non-coated D'Addarios . Are worth ? That depends . If 're active performer , maybe . You 're probably changing strings every performance make sure 're getting bright sound . You 're probably also buying strings box . There 's real benefit strings . Where really pay casual player may dozen spare sets handy . These days I 'm strictly hobbyist might play publicly twice year . I four acoustic guitars , may go go month without played . With coated strings , I leave set guitar , month two later I pull case 's ready play . I still change strings I 'm going playing public , guitars spend time sitting around house , great . These strings bomb ! I used D'Addario 's since playing days . Over years I experimented several different brands eventually found home Elixir Polyweb lights . After frets guitar ( Fender grand concert ) redressed I noticed restrung EXP 's ( I used eight years ago loved ) . Since guitar , I decided give another try . I glad I , tone great . They speak natural , bright lively voice sweet ears . EXP 's make guitar sound like . Individual notes speak warmth , definition depth . They blend together beautifully paying chords . They punch Elixir 's coating n't fray year like Elixirs either . D'Addario probably musical strings I ever used . They respond well dynamics bass response excellent finger picking . I able get eight months I noticed deterioration tone . I think I found strings I n't see using anything else . While I love trust D'Addario strings , subtracting one star , I really like packaging strings individual packets . For acoustics , I always change strings . I think bass strings get changed start falling sound.Anyway , classic strings I grew , I get involved playing , flexibility individual envelopes string becomes appreciated . Especially like save single strings use . D'addario company I 've using since I first started playing guitar strings live title . They DO warm , bright balanced tone last 3-6 months even playing hours day . For people finger style acoustic , comfortable fingertips . These strings produce good sound little effort , I almost always use medium picks strings get volume I want . I years using Elixir Strings myWashburn I accustomed saw sense making switch . I 'm glad I tried D'Addario strings . These strings excellent complement Washburn , mellowed years . They fair bit cheaper tonal quality rivals Elixir strings . I ca n't speak manufacturers claim `` 4 times life , '' , I 'd say strings fantastic value money . Highly recommended . I like , strings probably everyone . The EXP16s provide crisp , bright sound almost leaning towards metallic . This tone actually refreshing old shallow-bodied Ovation . However , I imagine dreadnought jumbo sound might quite I expecting , favorite aspect EXP16s playability . The play little elastic I thought would , amazingly easy downside I experienced EXP16s fact , giving guitar , little brittle guitar ( I almost snapped E getting set ) . Other , strings little squeaky . I personally like little squeak , current price point , I n't think would deal breaker even n't . I 've playing guitar years personally I would prefer Cleartone Elixir strings . I bought little sister loves . They really nice sound . I feel like could probably get pretty equivalent strings less money sister happy . I 've long partial D'Addario strings -- I n't guitar without . These phosphor bronze models found home Epiphone . As package says , 're warm bright -- leaning little toward brassy side . They project without sounding harsh tinny . Playing feel fairly smooth round-wound strings last ages . This good intermediate gauge : light enough lead work , substantial enough provide good tend stay loyal maker model string . My loyalty certainly shaken . For guitarist another string whose loyalty might wavering , reward . n't last long sound bright Elixirs half price . Good bargain though $ right , bright well balanced sound.My little brother ca n't tell difference since 's new , works well guitar . I like D'Addario strings , impress . They worth extra cost , opinion . I 've playing guitar 20 years . I 've played 6 strings , 12 strings , bass acoustics electrics . When comes acoustic sound , strings produce brightest , clearest sound string I 've ever used . Some strings `` bright '' sound clear , distinct tone - muted dull . Still , strings rich , full resonance carries room . This string I 've ever used qualities . In fact , first time I put acoustic went lead worship church , several church members commented guitar sounded `` better usual '' `` really good '' day . I 've tried brands since I found always end coming back . These strings last booming I get strings . I use EXP Phosphor bronze . These strings sound great . I Love sustained bright tone . They work well cedar top guitar . Easy fingers . 've used many brand guitars years . one good , long lasting guitar strings . balanced tone says box special coating system makes strings last longer non-coated ones lusting . easy install use , reasonable price . thanks amazon product sale . worth price matched hype hear read . GHS strings much cheaper much better strings . I think lasted week guitar I could get GHS Slinky Acoustics . These guitar strings sound month playing right I change . I use get real kick changing strings new strings sounded much different better , thrill gone strings sound good couple months although I change month anyway . I n't notice much difference though.But best part strings $ 17 bucks set local music store I get 'em $ Amazon 's subscription service delivered every month free shipping ! Beat ! One n't get much better D'Addario strings . In opinion 're twice clear Martin strings EXPs last forever . I like standard Phosphor Bronze well use less-expensive certainly recommend D'Addario nylon strings classical guitars . I 've heard string crisp , clean , rich sound brand strings . I 've used years give temptation try another brand ... always come back diameter strings sound significantly different , depending guitar use . I prefer mid-range string set overall depth sound mellow beauty tone . Any lighter guitar sounds `` tinny '' , heavier I fear strings putting undue stress neck . These `` right '' . Okay mine So first I want say packaging great ! ! ..I put guitar I say I impressed ! ! ... sound warm bright . I nanoweb , far EXP16 better ... I stay EXP16 right ! ! quality string ... I care tone feel . Took within hour put back EJ16 . They rough feel stiff . Lots folks like . 
458	I 've tried lot strings favorites , although I use heavier strings sometimes.These ones bend easier . The heavier ones better low end buzz last well expensive Ball Gore ( elixir ) , coated strings I used.And I like sound better . I tried Dean Markley Blue Steel Light accoustic strings Takamine guitar , soon replace . On quality control , high E steel string set looks bad dark spots , two show stringing guitar . String break I rather expected , looks bad . On sound , seemed okay first , I still find hard keep tune week , especially high B E steel strings , n't sound good . And I find low E wound string notes tend high I move neck , sets I used.Guess I 'll go back D'Addario Ernie Ball . As old strings slowly start stretch wear , hardly notice sound quality deteriorate . But 's important replace every month two , even hear problem current strings . Playing fresh strings best experience ever ! These Blue Steel light strings sound like gold . The crisp solid vibration top notch ! Probably better light strings I 've bought . They needed tuned often settled , new strings . I n't used long enough give review well hold , I 'll updating month . So far , great . Definitely recommended ! Best strings ever Strung Seagull guitar replace strings several years old gauge action guitar killed fingers n't get played much . These strings feel great sound fantastic . Very bright defined highs great rumbling lows . Nothing sounds bright strings . I 've tried many , best far . I know , cause I geetar real . strings starters feel really light sound weird u want buy really good pro please martin They sound great . They helped revive old acoustic guitar buried closet years ( along thorough cleaning ) . I n't opinion `` feel '' strings like reviewers . I honestly n't notice anything different . I bought I wanted great strings old cheap guitar order get best sound possible . These strings fine . The guitar sounds great . Job completed . 
459	V5 = 4 starBugera customer service = starsLets realistic , inexpensive tube amp . Nothing , nothing price reflects exactly , thats good thing , also , amp shipped bad tubes . ( microphonic ) Not big deal , happens time . But ... Bugera help , customer service far worst Ive ever dealt with.They clueless , arrogant bought replacement tubes solved issue , thats point.This experience alone probably stop ever purchasing another product.Now amp ok , best . It headroom , even 5w setting . I realize tiny combo wont much , thing clips far easily , forget running overdrive pedal . You get muddy , tones ok , dont expect Fender type cleans , arent there.Think Marshall cleans , even speaker isnt worth paper made plugged amp Celestion 1x12 cab ( comparison ) whole lot built well , even compared many amps costing far . If youre looking `` vintage '' tube amp , either cant afford cant justify price good one , try latter , I play home I simply cant justify $ 1K good tube amp.The classic overdrive sound 70s amp . If youre looking late 60s - 70s `` cranked '' amp stack tone , well , . But crank master keep preamp set preamp 'll get flat , flubby `` farty '' unusable tone.I love hate V5 , though price unbeatable , shortcomings ( overdrive ) hard live with.You sometimes pay , case , want vintage 70s tone `` bedroom '' volumes , cant go wrong V5 . I start saying I buy Amazon . Not 's bad price , I got discount open box demo unit local Guitar Center $ . I 've seen cheaper used ones , I wanted new one warranty.I using amp electric violin acoustic violin pickup . I wanted cleanest sound , bare bones controls 's little champ provides . Most time , I use Gain 1 2 Volume past 's cool 5w , 1w , .1w settings . I n't seen amp price range . The 1w setting perfect studio , .1w setting great using headphones jack . The 5w setting really crank volume.You could spend $ 100 get Vox AC4 series tube amp . That 's another amp I considering . I wanted something big portable , could use home without shredding walls . But Vox n't even Reverb like Bugera single pre-amp tube . And Vox , Bugera boasts know I plugged electric guitar cranked gain I could get lovely distortion , I 've tried violin . The digital reverb spacious feel . I love reverb would n't buy amp without it.It seems built well time tell holds daily use , I plan . When comes time change tube , many choices nice upgrade something better stock Bugera tube . I 've even read online people drop different speaker , opinion Bugera 8 '' speaker fine sounds like bigger , I 'm pleased . I also tried Bugera V22 tube amp Guitar Center . But , 's way much amp time . If I fill large hall sound , would way go . The V22 sweet . I never heard Bugera I tried model really impressed . Another option unplug speaker V5 , ( yes , speaker plug jack ! ) drive another speaker cabinet , Bugera also makes . You use speaker cabinet , I guess , minimum 4 , clearly written near Bugera V5 perfect , I would n't go smaller Bugera . I think Bugera hit nail head quality value , I 'll looking products made . The seem company . This little amp gives warm gritty sound . Arrived days free ship ( heavy little bugger ) . Small footprint allows place studio get deep sound like big tube amp . Use Shure mike 2 feet sound amazing . Recommend amp small space miked small venue . Really happy sound . This amp really surprized . It 's made china appears well looks great . There headphone jack I bought it.I would suggest useing overdrive distortion pedal . gain isnt great reverb isnt great ether . But amp welcome deal . No transistor amp I sounds good . I would suggest pedals This great little amp especially money . It 's tube , power attenuator , headphone reverb $ 200 - CRAZY ! ! It 's built extremely well weight , 'd problem carrying small gig . A 5 watt tube amp still quite LOUD , attenuator sound ask ? Tone subjective , ears get quite `` Marshally '' without lot work Les Paul well Tele . I n't Strat , I ca n't comment single coils . On 1 watt setting volume pinned gain 5 I damn good `` Back In Black '' style hard rock tone . If want play Metal 're going need distortion/overdrive pedal . I 've found pin gain get bit boxy fizzy . The headphone n't great , 's good enough practice , n't try use line recording.I 've done recording using 57 inch speaker grill slightly right center . When stacking 3-4 tracks ( especially using different guitars ) I got HUGE , Plexi like tone without getting muddy n't swapped tubes speaker - 's completely stock . I might try putting Jensen speaker , stock tone fine . The stock speaker 8 '' Bugera `` vintage '' ( think clone ) darker lot small speakers . A lot guys swapping tubes JJ 's GT 's , depends 're tone.A lot guitar snobs afraid Beringer name ( Bugera made Beringer ) , I found amp good quality - especially given made would recommend amp looking good tube tone cheap . It 's excellent platform mods tweaking type . I able get great Marshall like tone quite easily . Good stuff ! ! I 'd give baby six stars I could . My prior practice amp ( Vox ) nice , finally went south required replacement . I looking something great tube sound , solid-state amps I 've used ( mainly fenders line6 stuff ) n't get . I actually looking Fender Blues Junior headed local GC check 'em listen side-by-side . The first time I plugged Strat guy store , I blown away ( Jimmy Page wannabes cranking different amps store ) . I 've got ta say , part hoping rationalize extra buck Blues Junior , Bugera actually sounded better . The one left store floor model , I grabbed home cranked observations : - It 's solid heavy . It 's still small-fry ( slightly bigger 15w amps ) , much The construction great . I think I read reviews knocked construction , handle floor everything looks like 's built The sound even better home ( without GC cacophony ) - Adjustments minimal , enough . The tone adjustment basically takes tone fat sharp . I 've run Strat , Tele Taylor T5 . I think hard bodies get best blues tone , I get really nice clean tone The headphones sound great . I really surprised . I would thought needed speaker get great fat tube tone , sounds awesome pair good headphones- The price self-explanatory , 's really part blew away . This amp would sell double price tag . Once I read Bugera , I knew I wanted one . Why tube-like effects real , live tubes -- two fact ! Only five Watts , yes , 's still enough fill room . But 's extras cinch deal : built like brick house -- jump want . It internal cable speaker , easily plug different cabinet . Comes built-in reverb . Headphone jack standard . Best : attenuator , get cranked sound even low volume levels . Easily upgradeable -- I put new tubes speaker mine , though I probably n't . A small effective little : I modded Bugera Jensen used bass , recently I found source Celestion Super 8 drivers popped one . Amazing low-end output small cab ! I admit I got Guitar Center clearance , past week I 've , I love plugging . I 've got great vintage larger amp , would rather lug around small practice sessions , I 'm anticipating spending time apartment living , I looking small , tube-based amp . This thing gives great tone Strat Les Paul clone , overdrive pedal works well . Of course 's loud - 's whole point ! I note turned hum amps n't , 's really low volume . Also , tubes take minutes warm , since n't standby switch , turn volume knob plugging . But great stuff plug something solid tone without burn ears ( anyone else ) . Great little amp .

Of course stud better also drywall already 's good . For typical well maintained house apartment though fine even without stud .

I bought eleven order hang bunch guitars I found extremely simple quick install . The included anchors work perfectly went without issue , leaving String Swing solidly connected wall.If hanging lot guitars , making two rows ( one high one low ) seems best option . I spaced hangers eighteen inches apart guitars I put look nice good , tight spacing .

I put two hangers since I uploaded pictures , I new pictures , ones I put give good representation look get these.The easiest way hang lot use laser level theBlack & long cloth tape measure tack wall . I went wall making dots directly line , drilled quick pilot holes nine string swings installed 20 - 30 minutes . I think quickest easiest way get professional-looking far performance hangers goes , say ? The included anchors big enough keep wooden backplate securely fastened wall hanger screws metal receptacle middle . As long make sure tighten hanger properly , good shape.I DO NOT , however , recommend buying theString Swing Home Studio Wall Brown , complete garbage fall wall almost : I put hangers NOT drill pilot holes . The anchors made way nailed wall without using pilot hole . Just mark positions , use hammer nail anchors screw portion , screw . It took 1 minute put new hanger , partially due fact I able use level put bottom hangers get line . At rate , need drill pilot holes ; nail go ! Works Great ! Its good product , Just expected . I expect buy future . And price well worth ! ! ! 
462	When get , looks simple , basic ca n't believe n't come mic , companies got make money right ? I use Samson condenser perfect . Works great podcasting , vocals anything else want record . The adjustment knob little tight whatever , job well . I took chance one since I find mount MXL 4000 microphone . I originally bought `` universal '' mic stand guitar center cost way . That didnt come close working . But one worked perfectly ! Thanks Samson ! This nice looking solid piece equipment . single modification , I able fit array condenser microphones shockmount . I never owned samson microphone judging quality product , I would definately consider buying one . This Sam SP01 easily modded use Oktava . I found instructions google search . The metal piece bottom mic holder must removed . Instead hammering , I used two screwdrivers pry . That leaves nice hole little small use . Using tool , I able enlarge hole bit . As guide piece remove fits small groove . You must file sides til groove almost visible . Then Oktava fit fine . This mod easily reversible keep mind starting . I 'll post picture later.I found screw-on connector high quality . It wanted cross thread I putting mic stand . So I would n't want taking putting back frequently . That 's complaint . I ran recording tests microphone without shock mount . It seems ambient noise generally reduced shock mount . It 's especially effective microphone desk , computer tower ( 7 fans ) directly . It 's perfect , level noise reduction really amazing . On top , looks nice . If planning buy condenser mic desk , definitely consider getting , along solid stand pop filter . Fits MXL Cube mics perfectly ! Sturdy setup . Ordered two get items days exceed expectation While product came described , build quality felt little lacking . On website mentioned accepts Shure KSM32 threading , 're threading matches KSM32 , look elsewhere . The Samson shock mount work Audio Technica AT2020 , yes . Does work well ? If securely close little gap AT2020 shock mount , yes . There another reviewer gives good tip getting rid rattle using mount AT2020 . Only thing colors n't really match well I n't really care , good shock buy though , I really need one ? I n't really use mine since I carpet floors n't like mic stand shake much . I picked friend AT2020 USB Yes work mic . It 's solid , helps mounting , well used . No problems . Fits Behringer 60 dollar condenser mike fine . Like made company 's . They must standard fittings mikes . Works lot mics , , little modding , worked MXL V67G ; I needed . Does says well . The connector 3/8in female slot make sure whatever 're buying connect . The mic/boom stand I bought desk stand 5/8in male I buy 2 cheap adapters ( 6 $ ) . I also issues really `` locking '' Audio-Technica condenser mic shock mount . So far stays , n't `` super '' secure ( wobbles little 's moved ) , maybe I 'm wrong . Aside , though , great product . Excellent Quality expecting less product price job , I figured would made `` cheap '' feeling metal . I wrong . It stable steady feels like good steel aluminum maybe . It strong . It feels like I could really bang ( I wo n't ) would break.I use Audio Technica AT2020 screws perfectly snug still rotatable base . The mount holds firm keeps mic still . It eliminate little vibration pound desk ( whatever ) still come . It looks cool ( everybody knows matters ) . I pleased purchase . I n't think I say enough good things Samson SP01 Shockmount . Long story short I trying get podcast going scratch three months ago . I research discovered shockmount necessary keep noise anything securing mic picked mic recording . A shockmount absolute must , especially looking using tabletop mic stand table also used work surface.The build quality fantastic . I recently purchased shockmount additional mic used podcast.What I 've grown appreciate much seems fit condenser microphone I get hands . If considering buying condenser mic , make absolutely sure mic threads bottom screwed type stand shockmount . Nearly , companies like Blue ( Snowball , snowflake , etc . ) designed used conjunction shock mounts . I used MXL shockmount well AT2020 USB XLR version . The MXL fit like glove , perfect . The AT2020 , threaded , seemed bit loose , I added couple foam bumpers around base act washer . It made tight fit insulated sound interference short , I n't found better shockmount condenser mics . The attachment screws onto desktop tripod traditional mic stand . Fantastic . Buy two ! ! : ) Thanks Samson , make better mics ! I paired Behringer C-1 Studio Condenser Microphone . It matches mic well fit . The C-1 fits mount perfectly . I recommend mount : ? ie=UTF8 & qid ; & sr ; =8-1 & keywords ; This good , durable mount . I like look , well light-weight feel . Not much else said . I recently bought Audio Technica 2020 looking shockmount , I bought one Audio Technica makes I satisfied quality , I returned came across Samson SP01 . My first thought looked like shockmount I Neumann TLM 103 . I immediately purchased seeing people using AT 2020 . As soon arrived I put AT 2020 looked stunning , I mounted mic stand I bumped table times see worked . In short works great , The SP01 isolates mic extremely well . I also tested shockmount Studio Projects C1 Rode ( heavy mics ) works great . One word advice seems people problems hooking shockmount mic stand ( I find extremely amusing ) . Like shockmounts Samson SP01 adapter small US mic stands already mount ( part shockmount connects mic stand ) . THIS IS EASY TO REMOVE ! ! All take coin unscrew ! ! Once unscrew adapter shockmount connect stand . This best shockmount opinion ( This first shock mount I tried. ) . I bought desktop mic stand , used Audio Technica AT2020 worked nicely . It perfect job podcasting , well videos . I would recommend anyone . Not lot say , works great shockmount ! I think best part might also works Behringer . Those great mics cost , clips come break easily replacements hard find . That makes shockmount great option people boat well . Hooray ! This n't exactly fit MXL V67G condenser mic , I took bottom piece - took little work - I able get bottom screw plug mic fit . It 's solid works well . Does job . Good solid construction . Support cords seem good quality . Knob tightens well . Comes thread adapter . Smooth silver satin finish . Affordable price . 'Nuff said . Just buy one already ! This quality product.Super fast Amazon product well built easy use pretty straightforward.It 's perfect Samson mic . 
463	I finally purchased line tuner replace hand held cheap tuner . This thing way accurate old tuner true bypass n't suck tone . I n't used battery pack , n't know battery life . I use one-spot plug power . Another nice feature set turn volume use leave volume . It 's heavy seems sturdy well built . The display little confusing first , I read manual makes good sense easy use . Being studio owner I n't buy stage work . Being player multiple stringed instruments decades I 've many different tuners including real strobes . So I picked 8 months ago I needed one I right now.I n't know +/- % accuracy pegs ear tell 's quite accurate , enough I find notes neck slightest bit tune using . By using transformer adapter stage mic also works well acoustic instruments.I 'm still using replacement battery I put 6 months ago I use unplug . It 's travelled times airport security finds interesting thing carry almost seems durable enough drop feet continue working.I shocked well works . I shocked fact I could spend little get real tuner device gets close . Highly recommended . I normally tune drop f 8 string , even standard , I cant stand strobe , theres mode . I ordered pitch black $ 70 . Im still waiting return . It performs ok , although takes learning curve getting used strobe dial . I found difficult see pedal board , ( I 60 , eyes ai n't used ! ) .I also disappointed find power plug , battery . Adding 1 Spot power proved difficult way run battery adapter along side pedal pushed . I fixed problem taking grinding groove big enough wires unobstructed.For reasons , I use work bench tuner guitar set gone Engineering tuner pedal board . As musician four decades I 've owned number tuners technology progressed . My primary instrument electric bass . This finest piece equipment I 've ever purchased used , helped solve 'mysterious ' tuning phenomenon players apparently face without knowing . I 'll explain . But first , details tuner ... . : 's construction extremely solid , 's heft gives stability . When place surface ( top amp , floor , knee ... . stays ! ) . Secondly , large backlit display easy read lighting conditions , ... guessing . And thirdly , extremely sensitive accurate , brings explanation 'mysterious tuning phenomenon . At issue inability inexpensive tuners properly identify setting string intonation octave fret . I 've using $ 25 $ 40 tuners ( Boss , Korg , etc ) past years would indicate string tune , open string octave . But , simultaneously plucking ' F ' note ' A ' string , ' F ' note high ' G ' string ear would n't tune ... .the cycles n't matching . So , meant inexpensive tuner n't nearly enough . Once I began using strobe tuner , clearly showed ( proper accuracy ) ear trying tell . After setting intonation according strobe tuner bass ' range length neck . I guess another way explaining would say 's like accurate enough get right neighborhood , versus one get right house . For money , I feel I 've done good turn purchasing strobe tuner . I 'm satisfied . I still keep one inexpensive tuners guitar case built microphone used accoustic guitar player I 'm jamming somebody . This strobe tuner input ' ... mic , runs 9v battery connectors power supply ( sold separately ) . My ' device battery connector . It 's typical type ' top 9v battery two wires leading internals . I hate rule . I would prefer solid contact points compartment would simply insert battery , like inserting battery type ( AA , AAA , C , etc ) . I got great price decided give strobe tuner try . If 're accustomed vibration tuners takes getting used . While may technically accurate cheaper vibration tuners , advantage limited use given tuning guitars still compromise perfect order well intonated . One advantage clip tuners ( way , ca n't beat Snarks price ) electronically connected guitar affected instruments may playing time . I 've noticed trying tune playing live clip tuner seemed get & # 34 ; confused & # 34 ; instruments .

467	I read several reviews purchasing strings . I 've never bought strings sort coating putting Yamaha acoustic , sounded great ! They good high low tones give resonating tone whole guitar . My Yamaha expensive model strings make sound like . If 're wanting upgrade thicker set strings , definitely give try . The coating supposed make last longer resist corrosion , also little smoother fingertips changing chord positions sliding fret board . Time tell last longer strings price . , n't appear different cheaper Bronze wound strings . I expecting something different , far sound goes , strings tuned well required stretching 3 times get stay tune , even playing & # 34 ; smear notes & # 34 ; several songs . My problem cheaper strings ( ) would tarnish rust quickly , winding would come lose bare inner string fret marks guitar . The company claims treated prevent corrosion last 3 5 times longer . I 'll know weeks statement true . Since literally triple cost , I 'll know worth extra expense . Hopefully made USA instead China like things buy America . Good bad , I see longevity set , I 'll add review time . The Nanoweb strings stay clean stand , negative side ... I replaced one string set nanoweb noticed right away feel slippery . When picking fingers would slip nano string rather pluck . I stick cleaning good old standard strings . I 've playing guitar 15 years - within last year bought first Taylor guitar ( Taylor Guitars Grand Auditorium Acoustic Electric Guitar ) . It came Elixir strings factory . I blown away brightness purity tone strings produce . What 's even better long 'm pretty hard strings . I useDunlop Standard Tortex Picks , 12 Pack , Purple , stiff , chew strings quickly . The nanoweb wrap put string makes last several MONTHS instead weeks . They 're little bit expensive major string brands . But year listening ( gone 3 sets far ) , 're worth extra bucks . They feel great , last longer string I ever used importantly , sound terrific . The medium weight also better tone thinner gauges . My Taylor much louder I use these.However , may adjust truss rod change lite extra light . These pricey keep fresh sparkly tone much longer . When start sounding little dull wipe Fast Fret , loosen tension bit wipe 'em firmly sound new . Great great great great great great great great great . Been uning years . Love sound playability durability . coated good . These strings nice sound great . Elixer fantastic brand strings definitely worth price . I hesitate write review simply 's pretty obvious nearly everyone else loves strings . To honest , I , impressed feel handling . I think 're best playing strings I 've used comes pure playability . Hands , none better . They great flat picking . But trade-off , I simply n't impressed tone . I even took time try three different guitars ( dreadnoughts ) : classic maple sides/spruce top , mahogany spruce top , maple top . On three , I n't like tone much strings I using . I really wanted like , simply n't tone medium gauge Martin SPs I normally use.This n't say 're great strings sound different peoples ' guitars , I simply n't like mine . I love good projection rich bass tones ringing treble folk traditional music I play jam group . The Elixirs lacked punchy high tones Martin strings I use , treble sounds tinny vs. clear ring Martins I normally use . To fair , bass strings sound great , n't much different . I would say choose strings carefully based upon 're going use . I play acoustic groups , Elixir strings n't I need heard , spite great feel fingers . If playability important great tonal range , means buy strings ... wo n't disappointed . I 'm guessing would fine acoustic electric , electronics could compensate weaker treble tones . I 've using Elixir strings since Gore first made prototypes 10 years ago . I use electric acoustic . The product performs exactly guarantee . Every I 'll get & # 34 ; dead & # 34 ; string . I 'll call customer service number replace free charge . Same thing strings break tuning . Compared Medium .013 's Taylor 210 dreadnought ... . Martin SP Bronze & Phosphor Bronze , Martins SP , Dr , D'addario EJ17 Phosphor Bronze , Elixir Nanoweb 80/20 Bronze Phospher Bronze . I tried back back . Switching back forth . D'addario Elixirs . I 3 sets . One day I 'd try 3 playing along cd . Then I 'd try different set every 3 days . The Elixir 80/20 comes top . Best sounding , smooth fingers . Second , Elixir Phospher bronze , last D'addario . I 'd satisfied D'addario sound good . But Elixir sounds & feels better . I always go Elixirs . Great , long-lasting sound ! I would recommend anyone , experienced players amateurs alike . These perfect . Hard beat strings . They last , keep tune , keep tone . They n't need string cleaners either . So save money . An obvious noticeable difference Medium gauge Light Medium gauge recommended like finger-pick lot . But boy ... . Are bright ! Enough blow spruce tops pine trees ! I bought set recommended get tone I looking 7 week old guitar . Installed usual tuned . They sounded good played open compressing nearly impossible . My capo could even hold . I set guitar aside minutes heard wood . When I looked face guitar bridge pulling back trying pry . I released tension strings fast I could left . I returned got lighter ones avail . The body cracked around bridge useless . Use risk ! ! ! ! ! ! ! I personally would n't give nickel .

470	I issues tube amp I experimented replaced tubes . continued worsened . Hum , noise , volume fade , unwanted distortion low volumes . I eventually put back original n't help . Once I removed Tung-Sol 12AX7 preamp tubes replaced , hum stopped , sound quality amp consistent , quiet back par . My experience Tung-Sol tubes , negative . They caused go buy another amp . I idea brand new tubes could sound badly fast . I 'll never buy brand . If want increase amount gain distortion tube amp , drop one V1 position ( tube closest input jack amplifier ) . Easy , 'll notice immediate increase one Fender Blues Junior . Before master pre-amp/volume way , I could barely get overdrive . Afterwards , plenty . Day sound ... Not harsh , adds harmonics . Very lush sounding . Tung Sol knows . I recently acquired Vox Valvetronix combo amp local Music shop . I use amp mainly Modern preamp setting music I play . When I tried shop sounded great . Of course , I could n't go stage level shop , I could n't really get feel sound.I took practice next day really put floppy sound low end `` chugging '' low E. So I went experimenting . First , I converted combo amp closed back speaker cabinet instead original Vox open-back design . Small improvement , close couple weeks , I also noticed volume variations I played . With little research , I found one signs bad tube . I little research 12AX7 tubes found created equal ( course ) looking one tighter low end . This one came specs . ( I believe x [ ... ] I got info ) I got tube morning put gloves went switching tube . ( YES . THESE LIKE . THE FROM YOUR WILL AND THE QUICKLY ) I pulled GT Groove tube amp . I totally surprised ! Groove Tubes THE tubes late '80s . Now days , I read rebranded Chinese tubes . So sad.Anyway , total tone improvement . Got bottom end I wanted I make significant eq adjustments original settings easily nailed tone I looking forward . ! YOU NEED TO BE AMP AND YOU USE OR YOUR REVIEW IS ! That said , reason every amp cause tube react sound differently . Speakers also create different sound tube choice . Type pickups guitar also cause different : Vox : Celestion Alnico Blue 8 Tubes : JJ Amp Tube : Tungsol 12ax7 V1 stock Ruby tubes 2 spotsHow I Set My Amp : Volume breakup bass treble knobs ( changes per guitar stays close ) Guitars Used : Fender Telecaster Deluxe ' stock pups , Gretsch Silver 2010 stock Filtertrons , Gretsch Jet Blue Pearl stock Filtertrons , Fender Jazzmaster 65 ' American Reissue stock also purchased JJ12ax7 see sounded compare ruby , JJ Tongsol preamp tubes.I found Tongsol give best tone . Less bright still keeping chime amp . It caused enough high end roll give warmth I 've looking ( ears ) . I found JJ12ax7 much clearer slightly harsher high ? I REALLY like way Tungsol makes Jazzmaster sound . It 's heaven ! It gives perfect breakup point perfect roll could probably different guitar , cable quality , pick attack style playing . My best advise BUY MANY different brands TRY THEM ALL amp . 're expensive go cheaper ones . Most likely buy different amp point keep tubes maybe use one . Tone subjective . I little experience tube voodoo . So I say working well . I would buy . Not sure rate tube ? Replaced Chinese preamp tube Champion 600 couldnt tell difference tone . Maybe built better ? But thats yet seen . I put EH6V6 Chinese preamp tube notice improvement EH6V6 lasted five minutes shorted . So sent back . I ordered TS 6V6 still waiting . Maybe NOS way go preamp tubes ? Time tell . This quite tube gain 'd expect great 12AX7 tube . If looking push power tube distortion little bugger definately trick . Well made tube good amount gain highs . Excellent cleans crunch due increased clarity . For high gain metal , however , I found 's bit . For instance , V1 position preamp , little much trebly sizzle versus tubes . For comparison , Sovtek less `` hair '' tighter sounding also upper mid-range fizz get annoying . In end , I switched Tung Sol Ruby AC7 formerly V2 ( overdrive ) position , got better articulation less fizz . So Ruby AC7 V1 , Tung Sol V2 - 's best combo far .

472	I n't sound quality test another one works fine . I tested plugs work . If 'll get sound problems write update 'm confident 's going ok . This plug works well . I like right angle connectors . I Korg Pitchblack plus act powersource pedals . It included multi-plug cable , right angle one . The connectors kind stuck got way pedalboard . This works much better . This original plug fits purpose perfectly ! Quality precision ! The plugs n't take space ( could n't smaller ) wiring pliable easy rout spaces pedalboard . Keep away cheap imitations rob space hard work ! Make sure receive One Spot product original packaging ( check images ) . I 've got 5 effects hooked thing . It fits beautifully powers . Have problems . I recommend ! The One Spot great way supply power stomp boxes without bulky power supply bunch wall warts . Get , wo n't sorry . Arrived time ... works intended maybe more.One day , I pondering best wall receptacles power adapters also table spaghetti power cords used feed various DC equipment table rack . Fortunately , I chanced upon little gem instant ... problem solved . I chose 12V adapter highest rated power output used primary 12V DC source little gem power equipment table rack . I also bought another similar unit form another source Amazon used supply 9V DC source power rest units needed 9V source . Everything worked fine I relegated remaining adapters storage . Been working without problem day . This handy item need connect guitar effects power . Its easy install keeps things simple . No extra messy cabling . Glad I got . Thanks Amazon quick delivery . Bought guitar pedals works great n't cost much . I attached existing adapter voila . cable expanding capability One-Spot Godlyke 9V power adapter . plugs adequate pedal boards . Running 3 5 pedals board , logical choice power . The single transformer running board multi-plug easy set small profile plugs , combined thin cables makes neat uncluttered board . There drop power devices able draw current needed work peak . Further , transformer well away board , zero AC hum . What 's like ? Good quality , wired correctly , ca n't complain . If use `` One Spot '' power adaptor , need couple laying around . It 's probably practical , I wish made sizes . In one configuration , I need two plugs , another configuration I need three , yet another configuration I need five , I actually bought , cut length I need . This helped lot building pedal board , actually think kinda overpriced , really really good.I 2 recommend product . What I say ? It . 5 pedals chain runs safely without crazy hiss hum rig . Of course , 're running chain drive/distortion pedals , 're asking great . Zero complaints . Nice daisy chain , If 's bought along 1 spot adapter , make sure avoid using connectors , since could overload adapter 'll noise problems performance issues , use 4 analog pedals connected ( I ) wo n't problem , I play around also realized pedals might use little power , I I 1 spot adapter connected power strip 3 boss pedals Wah , power strip slot I another generic adapter connected MXR noise clamp n't interferes . I works fine . Works like charm . Powers five 9V effects , using one power supply . I using four plugs worked flawlessly . No dead 9V batteries . Some effects eat 9V batteries like 6 year old cone cotton candy . I one spot ran plugs pedals . This product allowed lengthen cord provide added power supply I needed . No tone loss . Great extension rather get another power supply ! ! ! I bought extension , plug allowed stop using eight batteries . Hard like . If 1 pedal ( ) need 1 spot adapter . It save lot money batteries battery runs stage . It 's worth 's weight gold . Sound sends FAST ! . You count future purchases ! Thanks Guys ! I used along Dunlop DC adapter fits nicely . I 'm powering Zoom MS-50G Fulltone OCD . It pay year saved battery costs . I two pedals , one outlet spot many , really makes difference 're onstage one power strip . Now I wish I attachment would let charge laptop iPhone plug pedals . Ca n't always get want . This product works advertised , beware . These RIGHT , WILL NOT fit lot pedals including warned ! ! ! I started powering 1 stomp box chain worked , I tried add second/third stomp box , I could n't get guitar sound loud buzz . I returned product I testing , I would recommend anyone . With personal experience mind , I would advise save money get pedalboard power supply . hope helps I bought I already bought `` 1 spot '' plug pedals , I needed something power without buying adapters greatest way solve problem . Highly recommended . One come 8-pedal multi plug . If 4 pedals , lets say 12 , powering 8 plug makes difficult isolate power noise levels properly . The left connectors cause ground issues touch things n't plugged pedals . Using smaller multi plug leave less open spaces , alternatively attached link another add plugs . Very nice quality , one spot stuff . Great price , great purchase . Completely quite . problem . I two . Good long cable works well pedals , well worth get ride annoying 9 v batteries . If 're buying new effects pedals ( like I ) , 'll concerned whether 'll work inexpensive pedals 're likely also buying , especially since large kit number converters might scare thinking 'll need . The two common types inexpensive pedals Danelectro Behringer , 're like 're 'll buy quite . The good news , NOT need buy converters . This little beauty run Behringer Danelectro pedals , standard 9V power supplies available ( n't NEED buy , I use Behringer could certainly put together less-expensive Planet Wave 're working even tighter budget . In short , buy product , save cost 9V batteries within first two months 're low-price pedals . Works . Works expected last really really long time . Glad I bought . Nothing else say . Thanks . ... thing great multi-pedal use ! This must Danelectro/FAB pedals . As anyone one pedals knows eat 9-volts like candy , purchase power supply ( search Danelectro DA-1 AC Adapter ) cable 're good go 5 pedals ! No battery swaps . Very nice cable . I used Planet Waves 9v adapter . It works well , pedals powered one adapter useful . The adapter would probably even better takes one place power strip etc instead chunky old school adapter like Planet Waves style . Really nice product price . This product n't really one review advertises . I use one spot boss daisy chain coming TU-3 ( great tuner way ) . Starting build pedal board I figured better start 30 dollar power source go spend like two hundred T-Rex fuel tank , I 'm planing future . Great adapter pedals , decent quality , ten bucks . Ca n't beat ! It 's well build daisy chain DC power cable . It good lenght two plugs . You wo n't difficulties plug pedals . This works great enough plugs 5 pedals . I needed two pedals case , extra plugs hanging floor better setting another wall wart pedal . If needed future I extra plugs . I recommend Multi-Plug everyone ! great little cable . power pedals one power supply . makes setting gigs much easier 
473	Large pedal board plenty room pedals including . The included velcro works well , I n't pedals fall yet ! fits underneath couple modifications . I 'm careful stuff soft case suits fine , I sling shoulder carry guitar/amp . Plus large useful pocket front bag . If travel lot hard case probably better though . This issue bad boy quality , features , design . This Pedaltrain product , like Pedaltrain 2 , well-made , perfectly designed board exactly claims holds 50 freaking pounds guitar effects stuff . And , friends problem.I using Voodoo Labs power supply , also get , 6 outlet power strip I drilled upper left corner handle couple extra pedals . I plug wall use homemade 8 & # 34 ; power plug Voodoo . On pedal I able fit 2 Jim Dunlop volume pedals ( one looper ) , Crybaby Wah , TC Electronic Flashback , , mojo overdrive , Corona chorus , Hall Fame Reverb , Ditto looper , vibrato . I also MXR flanger , Helicon Harmony pedal vocals , Korg tuner Electro Harmonix tremolo . ( I know , I know . ) Did I mention sucker big ? I feel like name & # 34 ; pedal porch & # 34 ; . Maybe I put potted it.So getting back question whether get , I ask , ask , & # 34 ; Do I really need pedals ? If answer & # 34 ; Hell yes , I deserve ! I worked hard make awesome sounds ! ! & # 34 ; , means knock . Just n't get lugging around make sure book venues appropriate stage space . No joke . This simply one best pedal boards . It well made , resistant , tough flexible adapt wide variety power suplies keep pedals great shape . Looks good . I would recommend get roles power-grip pedalboard velcro definetely holds pedals much better 'industrial ' velcro included , especially combination regular size ( MXR Boss ) bigger pedals like Cry Baby VOX Satchurator Time-Machine Reverb . If thinking purchasing one , would probably thousand invested pedals , would great keep protected organized . Now , road long , I would suggest get hard case instead soft case . For eventual gigging soft case ok . I 've owned couple Pedaltrain pedal boards . First PT-2 Pro . I use house Line6 M13 , M9 , Korg Pitchblack tuner , Deluxe Wah Boss channel switch . There 's plenty pedal board real estate soft case incredibly strong durable . You imagine board VERY heavy , , soft case great job . The included Velcro keeps incredibly heavy M9 M13 securely place even I store pedal board upright/on edge weekly gigs . There 's also lot places use zip ties clean rig . Also comes great little bracket house Voodoo Lab possibly pedal power supplies . Pedaltrain makes great pedal board . I say . I got unit , opened softcase pulled nice black powder coated aluminum pedal board ... WOW lot space thing . Do I think price fair piece welded aluminum basically re-branded ' nylon bag . No . Its priced considering thats get plus plastic ties velcro . However , I factor laziness wanting build board , suddenly one hundred fifty bucks seems like decent trade . I disappointed see cheap-o rubber feet , guess missing 6 months , I learned fix . Specifically product solid welded aluminum soft case feels rugged ... 'll see . Again , gripe price considering mounting system velcro , least comes , power supply . However , need lot pedal space ( read dimensions ! ) heft welded aluminum , may last pedal board buy . Did I mention thing ' huge ? one star little price gouging ...

475	I purchased friend taken playing violin , prefers rosin came student violin wood grip around rosin . Its much better I got violin . Its good I ca n't really complain , considering basically tree sap . 's ok little cheaper quality I expected . I would recommend going little higher price . It also arrived cracked . The rosin trick , 's nice wooden holder , n't crack easily ( unlike round rosin containers ) . really cool looking rosin , works well overall awesome , cant break either becuase wood I rosin mess apply . This rosin great 's encased wooden sleeve leaves fingers free rosin . It 's easy apply n't leave messy residue fingers . I n't playing violin long know I needed something rosin bow easily . This exactly I needed . I got daughter cheap fiddle rosin big time got use instead . Works well learn trick scuffing first time use . I know everybody knows already , I 've never played bow , instruments use pics least fingers . 
476	I 've swapping back forth Evans Remo , really liking kick head I decided lean toward Evans consistency setup.I online forum find would closest ' I really liked Remo Evans line , I led G2 series . ( Remo 's Emperor series -- 2 plies free floating film ) Honestly , I think I 'm going stick Evans though ! I ordered pack shortly 360 ' sizing , I wanted give try . My fears getting old stock unfounded set I got new enough sized.I got , tuning seemed pretty easy . I use drum dial ballpark start tuning process , went smoothly . Not sure placebo effect , I seemed able get little low range floor tom well -- deeper resonant 808 coating seems hold better Evans heads well -- Remo tends ' within hours play , Evans lasts longer , finished feel . Recently I looking heads put set Starion shells I modified . My original plan use set Attack heads resonant batter side shells . That decision based mostly price . Not completely though I used Attack heads resonant heads good results . The Attack heads I bought though single ply . To make great resonant heads I think two ply head better batter head . I gave Attacks shot sides I n't completely happy sound felt two ply head would better way go.In past I used Remo heads batter heads almost exclusively . I still much like Remo Pinstripe heads decided give Evans heads try try something different . I happy I ! These Starion shells nice sound lots resonance . The noticeable difference G2 's Attacks tuning range seems much wider . The Attacks narrow tonal range resonated . The G2 's seem resonate everywhere ! From loose moderately tight nice sound resonance . I Moon Gel damping pads installed cut resonance way instead choking drum offers much better sound . By adding , removing , moving Moon Gel pads around I control exactly much resonance drums without change heads tune.I mention I still using single ply Attacks resonant side . With G2 's top Attacks bottom shells sound great ! Also , bass drum I Attack ring heads sides . I also pillow damping bass drum sounds amazing ! So , Attacks place batter side I impressed sound , tuning range , ease tuning G2 's . If 've never tried , give shot , likely already know I 'm talking ! I using 6 months . I play twice week maintained good sound past 6 months . Not difficult tune either . These good heads . I played several drum sets pleased sound , look feel . This super solid price . I bought try . I used remo little I used heads wanted try Evans see . Amazing . I practically beat crap held . My next acoustic drumset Evans . 
477	..and 's good thing . I wanted tuner pedal I could use lighting condition . My previous experience Korg equipment made Pitchblack 's much I say n't already said except & # 34 ; true bypass & # 34 ; nonsense . If tone sucks device problem somewhere else , effect . If want talk unity gain , hand , I 'm ears ! My experience little tuner perfect ... It 's extremely easy see dark stage environment / 's dead quiet activated / easy understand looking 're tuning / Takes little room pedal board / cream coffee 's hundred bucks - 's crazy build quality - 's little iron highly recommend little guy - Korg got right one.. ! ! ! This tuner works great . I put 9 volt battery couple months ago still going strong . It take 9 volt output power supply I another pedal , great . It , accurate get confused normal conditions . You need hit one string time , however . Size perfect pedalboard small still quite readable . Price good . I Boss past took back seemed overpriced complicated . tuner awesome accurate , noticeable else say , price , best deal ever . get ! ps use base though , satisfied . thanks Korg ! ! ! Excellent pedal tuner easy read light dark stages mutes signal tuning . Well-designed rugged construction . I believe much better value major brands cost least 50 % . operation makes simple operate . The best tuner board opinion ! Great display , easy view/read , simple click n't noisy . Since true bypass pedal turns engaged , great feature since battery drain use even things plugged . Silent on/off , I two . Recommend anybody looking tuner rig . The main reason I bought tuner similar offerings boss tc electronics , I read prior making purchase accurate low tunings , bass player sometimes playing drop A must . I say owning I must agree . I 've used tuners I happened bring one along thats experience . Also easy read note 're 're dimly lit stage . I use tune antique Korg ... I saw baby road 's James ... make sure guitar intonation perfect . This pretty much ideal tuner , far I 'm concerned . It 's true-bypass , brilliantly visible easy read dark stage , accurate , small footprint , durable , powers pedals , $ 100 , especially bought used ... virtues many varied . If 've using cheap crappy tuner like I , 'll notice difference more.If want tuner kind technical work , Pitchblack 's tolerances might quite 're looking . But far stage tuners go , 's got tighter tolerance Boss stompbox.If want buffer chain , pedal wo n't supply , true-bypass.If want hear strings ringing tune , pedal . The output muted tuner engaged . I prefer make audience listen tune , non-issue . Plus , I like able use pedal circumstances I think might valid reason buy Pitchblack right : After time pedal , I 've noticed used power pedals , n't like pedal 's power output , notably tremolos . But daisy-chain cable connected straight power supply Pitchblack powered like pedal , problem vanishes . Kind strange , I figured worth noting , I n't consider enough problem take points recommend box less . This third purchase tuner . All three work perfectly . Very easy tune basses . One younger son started playing bass . The ( one backup ) .The reason I gave latest tuner four stars one metal connectors attaches 9v battery loose barely hangs battery post . I may tape keep place . The two tuners n't , 's best around . Buy ! For best guitar tuner . It job correctly doesnt go crazy 're tunnin , ; ) Little say incredible little stomp box : color sound , build like tank , large display perfect smelly dark bars joints musicians play KORG brand printed ... thats enough trust great tunner.Cheers ! ! ! ! I bought tuner TC Electronic poly tune I happy purchase . Very simple use , great visibility color signal engaged . It also ability daisy chain pedals currently I need . I highly recommend . There things life n't want think , tuner one . You enough think stage without worrying tuner . It fast , reliable looks great pedal board . It true bypass n't add bit noise suck tone . Your brand preference guide decision , n't shy away well-made piece equipment . I would buy . No choice market IMHO . This one get . I two would buy I needed another one . This unit perfect solution people whose amps mute switches tuning . It absolutely silent mode mutes tuning without clicks pops switched , bypass ( tuner ) mode totally transparent tone . Its 4 tuning modes make selecting one works best extremely simple ( I personally prefer full strobe ) . Its tuning quick accurate , n't hunt pitches like tuners , especially 6-string bass . Its single 9-volt battery used mode activated , battery last long , long time . The display bright clear . It 's rugged , well thought , solidly built , simple.My complaint calibration mode : 's series numbers change hit calibration button . Its explained manual , could clearer . I 'd buy without hesitation , though . This product easy use , without noise . I truly recommend tuner pedal . I 'm happy product . It simple , accurate , takes little room , several modes nicely backlight . To top , 's half price pedal tuner . Korg ... king practical tuner world . Only days working great I like true bypass . Price outstanding tuning spot . The default tuning display perfect I 've real impressed top tuners . IMO ca n't go wrong tuner , pleased . As accurate easy use excellent Korg DT-10 , I plugged battery , hooked guitar ( I tuned using Korg DT-10 I already ) came meter mode verified exactly tuning DT-10 gave ! I love ! Nice footprint , easy see indicators bright room darkened stage , one input 1/4 & # 34 ; jack right , one output 1/4 & # 34 ; jack left . Simple use . I probably never use three display modes , 's nice tht I want play . The perfect tuner . I like pedal , heavy click press , playing dark room LED lights nice bright . True Bypass . I 'm telling , get . I use first pedal guitar cable touches goes pedal board . It 's true bypass , means sound affected 's use . When step button , sound cuts get tuner . It works advertised . My complaint could smaller . There smaller true-bypass tuners space issue board . I 've posted photo tuner board -Pedaltrain MINI With Soft Case . If need smaller tuner , I buddies use like polytune . The Korg Pitchblack probably , along BOSS , considered one industry standards compact pedal bypass tuners use guitar bass . Both TU-2 Pitchblack excellent , I n't really opinion yet better . However , strengths Korg Pitchblack may lead prefer tuners . The primary draw bright display wide color bars . The tuner displays note closest , colors guide perfect pitch , marked green light middle ( almost like airplane landing guide ) . But lights indicate tone turning , actually dim transition one another go across semi-tones . You could argue , therefore , visual guide giving lot precision would get simple on/off light . The tuner works quickly reliably.The build quality outstanding , 's true bypass . When step pedal , tuner guitar signal . The switch also `` soft button '' variety , similar find Vox pedals many boutiques . It nice feel , though could easier bump 's high traffic great tuner reasonable price . It really comes user preference , I 've heard many guitarists prefer one high accuracy visibility . Awesome tuner , really fast responsive . Best accurate , enough using setups resulted much quicker easier process I anticipated . Nice bright I clearly see stage dark . Occasionally I get small pop I engage frequently . This pedal feels good sturdy , I really see anyone breaking unless feel need leap monitors switch . Price easy enough anything happen , I would think twice picking another one . Just picked Korg Guitar Center yesterday . I use Snark time needed something tune practice everyone playing making noise . love thing far . accurate , fast , fits nicely pedal board metal plastic like tuners price . like multiple display options . Mute function awesome true bypass believe . great buy , happy . got red . Easy use , accurate great visibility tuning indicators . This tuner fine low B 5 string bass . Some tuners work well low frequency . Very good tunner , bypass switch . I think 's good choise pedalboards . I changed TC Electronic Polytune .

480	This I 've ever spent guitar strap . But I say 's well worth price . Very comfortable looks great ! I n't play guitar waist . I six feet tall . While well made , wide , comfortable good looking , sling far short returned . reading couple comments review 's obvious original review somewhat irrelevant I using strap wrong application . According first comment verified companies website ( I done buying ) strap meant bass guitar . Please n't purchase thinking work standard acoustic probably even acoustic bass . Amazon item description . Thanks comments sorry misleading review . **I 'm tall person strap incredibly short . I currently two leather straps potential acoustic would hang waist , even though I usually play midway torso . I n't NEED straps super long thing makes hard even put guitar . It feels little tight crammed I wear . I 'll probably end adding string one end give extra 4 inches . The leather n't bad quality , 's finest . I 'd suggest dropping extra $ 20 getting high quality strap . **I wanted I reviewing product regards acoustic guitar . I read reviews seems using electric guitar complaints , acoustic good 2-3 times thick electric , serve needs . Excellent strap money . The leather thick supple . In fact materials thick , little tricky get adjustment tail setup.A note Some might find standard Levy 's strap length short , aware need note XL versions . For , many straps market price range long , including , Dunlop ( wide ) , Mono ( even short model inch long ) . I 'm bass player standing , I prefer bass waist height . A basses , I prefer higher . I 'd suggest strap places instrument comfortable , measure button hole button hole sure 're ordering right length . I used regular guitar strap bass , I got regular weekly bass gig using often , started feel like strap digging shoulder . Your mileage may vary , I decided time check wider strap actually intended bass.I read lot reviews decided one -- cheaper leather straps described stiff uncomfortable , one usually reviewed well . It perfect choice . This strap needs wearing-in -- 's supple soft right box . The leather top smooth classy looking , suede underneath comfortable soft , good friction helps stay put shoulder . The wider strap distributes weight bass better , cushioning two layers leather also helps . All adds great deal comfort.I use Dunlop strap locks instruments , thicker strap like , I concerns getting , flat head screwdriver little bit encouragement put strap locks strap , problem.I would highly recommend strap bass player , even someone especially heavy guitar . I bought someone told really liked ... 's good product ... bought help weight Les Paul shoulder . The problem , thick part strap made short I bring neck guitar shoulder , weight guitar skinny part strap.The leather feels bit cheap well ... get pay for.I guess strap ok play guitar one position ... yippeee ! I 'll probably pay $ 100 real strap . Straps n't get better . Super leather , well put-together . Perhaps bit wide , play short sets . For gigging pro , I think width advantage spreading weight . excellent , excellent . 
481	I bought try baritone uke.It works great easy use.I use Fender problem suction cup except rougher face Martin able attach smoother back sides using suction wet could also use small clamp , blue painters tape , etc. , trouble could used instrument . Some may need picks anything attached to.It feed back depending close angle price . I bought pickup placement two ukeleles I own.The first ukelele Lanakai LU-21 . It installed pretty easily , except adhesive lost I moved pickup new location within soundbox . I need get stronger carpet tape new adhesive secure permanently new location . It sounded great though -- several people commented loud sweet instrument sounded guitar also mixer , amp PA system . We boost gain mixer significantly get adequate volume , able project enough sound dance 100 people . Straight guitar amp , gave plenty volume.Happy results , I installed second one Mahalo ukelele available Amazon . The installation went well except endpin jack would n't `` stay put '' sound hole . On Lanakai problem -- ragged washer goes inside endpin jack supposed bite wood inside instrument . It supposed stop endpin jack turning screw strap pin/bolt onto endpin jack outside instrument . On Lanakai , ragged-edged washer bit softer wood easily job well . On Mahalo , smooth maple pine , ragged washer could n't bite wood . As result , endpin jack turned turned I tried screw outer button never went tight enough . I put masking tape around end pin jack make fit snugly hole I created end block ukelele . THEN enough resistance allow install strap bolt tightly.My biggest beef unit fact takes hole fit snugly ukelele . This odd size , end using 7/16 drill bit common drill bit sets . Because small , make hole '' larger whatever means available . This slow process I tried hand , using dowel sandpaper wrapped around . A peg-hole reamer might done better job , I n't one.So , I eventually found dowel glued sandpaper , shoved drill press , slowly lifted 7/16 '' hole ukelele spinning sanpaper dowel . This took care sizing problem matter seconds , although really tight fit , use masking tape around endpin jack Mahalo stablize , directions n't tell much placement 3 nuts , 2 flat washers , ragged washer , strap goes end jack . I way , starting inside ukelele : ( washer-ragged washer ) -- OF THE -- ( outer thick washer , outer , outer strap pin/bolt ) . The purpose stabilize . This sequence pieces worked instruments I installed , played different guitar amps , well system , I pleased results unit ukelele . I would buy another I needed amplify yet another accoustic instrument . I going say pickup best thing since sliced bread , built solidly built last . It simple , practical , cheap . There obvious advantages disadvantages . You n't buy $ 150.00 pickup $ 200- $ 300 instrument . Being able plug self-sufficient ( rooms , especially open mics ) easier better relying mic , especially beginners , takes skill discipline stay within mic 's sweet spot . Also , rooms/PA's/hosts work well trying mic instrument . At least pickup like potential keeping sound front center . ( I experiment different instruments & write quality later . ) That said , one piezo element , unlike K & K ; pickup , example . So limited giving optimal sound , matter placed . Also , case tell image , soldering connection wires exposed jack , used inside instrument , means drilling hole . I know I ordered , I buying cheap device , n't expect great . It works . That enough , amazon requires certain number words . Very authentic sound reproduction . Simple install aware instructions clear . The threaded end ' hook wire pull position tailstock . You 'll never get arm far enough . need drill bit complete install . I considering $ 100 K & K pickup amplify $ 40 pawn shop guitar I grown fond , I bought take beach camping , places I would bring expensive guitar . I couldnt justify spending double pickup I guitar I bought glad I . Arrived one day , I first experimented different placements using double sided adhesive came outside guitar , plugged cord un-installed played around 20 minutes , 'll notice huge difference sound inch inch . Found sweet spot near area & # 34 ; 2 & # 34 ; weak instructions . I drilled hole using straigh bit end pin screwed block almost 1 & # 34 ; thick , I didnt want tapered hole reamer , I wated straight hole . As others noted , impossible fit arm soundhole , I inserted philips screwdriver end pin hole , slid jack onto tip screwdriver help guide hole first slipping plain washer friction washer little teeth dig wood hold . Because cant reach hold jack steady tightening outer nuts , give holes threaded jack ( easy go un-noticed ) I able spin washer nut threaded end , secure holding threaded portion spinning ice pick jack one small holes I tightened nut firmly . Took 3 trys I adjusted perfect length I spun nice little finishing cap threads , tightened right threaded portion flush cap neat appearance . Too much sticks , little theres enough thread tighten cap , adjust length installed jack nut inside guitar , theres plenty threaded jack accomodate thickness block wood tail guitar 2 sides meet . Plugged fender 30 Wow blown away sweet sound , I glad I saved ton money ! Ordered 2 guitars , Even one nylon stringed acoustic since pickup magnetic . I say output low , I turn amp almost 10 fill , would work playing without preamp , I like theres battery , I plan buy strap mounted external preamp I use one preamp 4 guitars rather installing 4 preamp equipped pickups guitars $ 100+ ! Terrific bargain price ! ! ! So decided amplify Martin Dreadnaught ( really , really nice acoustic guitar ) . I n't want spend lot would n't sound good pickup , saw consistently good ratings . I ca n't speak acoustic pickups , far exceeded expectations , I n't plan buying expensive piezo , soundhole narrow portion barrel long enough fit block ; I n't want drill new hole not-so-cheap guitar test relatively cheap I attached pickup regular position inside body behind bridge , ran cable sound hole . The jack held onto pickguard scotch outdoor mounting tape ( kind like really strong , removed without leaving sticky residue ) ; holds place well enough plug cable move around long I n't jerk guitar quickly.SOUND plugged cheap , regular guitar amp , whoa ! The package mentions two locations place pickup , I needed run sound hole , I could place treble picked . So I compensate amp turning treble 7 pickup transducer , electrical picked , sound clear crisp . It would probably sound even better amp better electric shielding ; noise I get even max gain , max input volume , amp , heard every instrument I plug I turn master volume thing consider transducers pickup vibrations , wo n't pick sound placed away guitar body , touching . So mind , pickup strongly output every sound make guitar body ; like brushing body , zipper hitting guitar , fingers sliding strings etc . This pickup pretty good lower volumes . But becomes feedback nightmare higher volume . The pickup , sensitive.Also , spend time exactly place pickup , makes big difference ! Try put near solid part instrument pickup much make like bottom cave something . I bought cheap way amplify acoustic . lesson . Should forked money . I Yamaha F335 I really like . I say someone take piezo transducer amplify guitar I thought I 'd try . I first picked transducer $ 3 experimented . I like , sounded good I saw I thought I 'd try . n't bad except I bought set drill bits I n't need $ 10 . So I got installed plugged start sound alright . I wanted playing around home I n't need real great sound quality . But sound ok except picks every bang knock especially planet waves I think quick connect strap connector . My complaint I could n't turn loud without feedback screeching . Overall product quality good . Setup ok. Price good . Sound opinion needs tweaking . I first installed one new ' guitar , test I truly blown away quality sound ! I purchased guitar practicing cold dry , New England winter ! The sound good I ended putting another one prized , 1973 Guild ( built Japan ! ) . This guitar sounds much better laminated Fender pickup reproduces accurately Fender amplifier 's ' setting.I tried attaching pickups various positions found I liked sound best pickup attached slightly , towards bottom guitar slightly favoring treble strings side bridge , center lower several good installation videos show exactly how-to install acoustic pickup one.I 've used pickups record several favorite guitar pieces . It 's wonderful , longer keep guitar perfectly still relations external , stand mounted microphone ! If wish record acoustic guitar , effective inexpensive solution ! The fact passive really kills . I could get sound , I tried multiple placements . I finally bought guitar pickup . Not worth money , extra hole guitar . I lot guitars work couple secrets installing mike pickup : After drill hole , trying figure get thejack place inside guitar , ; Get cable run hole drilled grab throughthe sound hole . jack AXL pull hole using cable . You may couple times get jam nuts set right depth , way make processeasier big help . Also , I use giant endpin collar came , takesup lot thread space accomplish sweet spot smaller 's close impossible soundhole actually small , ca n't get hand , finger length far go , cases , go direction low E string side typically lacking smaller instruments unless Jimi Hendrix hands case , , Travel guitars ; GET OF THE GIANT STRINGS THAT COME ON SOME OF THESE ! My SX traveller came 's I could even hear low E string . I old set electric 10-46 's I took BB King Lucille , heck swapped ; Man difference ; actually much difference I really n't need AXL I installed even though 's fun far amp , I little HoneyTone feeling place alongside large amp arsenal , may found home , small get go along Travel guitar . This hit-or-miss product . For fell short others seems work well . It 's total loss since I reuse endpin jack soundhole solution I ended . It cheap enough worth taking chance . 
482	This mute allows practice without annoying family harm violin . It seems well made . I really wanted work , n't . Do n't bother , n't mute strings . One star , getting time . cheap , easy use , cuts sound 70 % . Ideal beginner living apartment . Works exactly described . If want 90 % sound reduction however need metal mute . This one works better smaller rubber ones . Glaesel Violin Ultra Practice Mute good tool violin . If afraid disturb neighbors , practicing violin - buy . It put sound . It really works . I works ok details using curve Mute curve top supposed go one way , match shape reversing 'll see I , press mute almost way top ofthe bridge , otherwise wo n't mute sound used correctly , mute works well . I 65 years old taking violin lessons nine months . As imagine , I need practice LOT ! My wife 43 years enjoy practicing ... especially I practice scales.I saw Glaesel Violin Ultra Practice Mute demonstrated online violin instructor 's web site . I love ! Easy put take . The rubber wo n't hurt violin , bridge strings . You barely hear next room . You actually control much mute actually mutes violin raising little bit bridge . My violin 's tone n't change much I practice I want without fear wife ! Nice use violin . A must need prevent annoying people practicing . Great buy . Excellent ! 's Little ! Highly recommend item . It rubber like stuff damage instrument . A Must . doesnt completely mute violin suppose nothing really , take loud noise though I evaluate product instrument I purchased repaired returned . Sorry , I rather comment used . Really perfect advertised . Experienced player might choices , , easy use exactly met purpose . I bought Glaesel Bridge & Glaesel rubber mute together . I bought cheap many good reviews . The mute fits bridge fine , compared brass mute ( course works VERY well ) mute seems absolutely nothing . There almost discernible difference playing violin without mute . Also , mute affect playing certain notes screech stutter produce undesirable You want need mute practicing quietly ( many us ) , I suggest buy something else . This item work total waste money . I tried mute regular acoustic violin well new Electric Violin bought Amazon ( FYI , cheap little electric violin awesome & fun item ! *Just make sure Original Peg Drops & 4/4 Violin Bridge ! ) .I consider mute completely useless since anything . It *not* mute lower volume violin noticeable way . Takes edge violin sound . I keep office violin I n't disturb neighbors silly spanish sing shakira ridiculous volume constantly ... .. I 'm sure much I say mute . It 's easy put take , job . It mutes violin reasonable level . I used meter distance sustained open G string gave reading . With mute , dropped -6db . I tried Yamaha silent electric violin ( unplugged ) distance , barely registered . I recalibrated meter muted acoustic violin read , Yamaha read -6db distance setting.So wo n't make instrument completely silent , purely subjective perspective , seemed bring things closer silent violin , perhaps seeming 10 20 % louder I measured accessories , tonal quality typically important . But mute , expect deteriorate . Surprisingly , still lot tone left , especially compared unplugged electric , yet buzzes horrible artifacts ca n't expect give great sound complete silence , wo n't disturb neighbors dogs , wo n't make instrument sound dead . This 15 times cheaper cheapest silent violin , latter probably sound worse . It 's ultimate solution quietness lets stick instrument choice . 
483	This little stand serves many purposes home , keyboard stand even stand put pedalboard I want test different pedal gig , It holds presonus mixer , A laptop wireless transmitters receivers.. It versatile narrow wide AND Short well , I onstage connector allow connect mic boom it.. I plan using one day hold Ableton Live machine well small 2 octave keyboard I use mic boom arm point ! Even keyboard stand , I like I put pedals underneath it.. WIth fully extended & # 34 ; Long & # 34 ; mode , I fit pedal train pro mini underneath it.. Of course , 54 solid inches stage front though.. Which indeed lot small places I fit Love I n't assemble stand ! Just unfold . Was easy adjust stable . It 's nice able sit keyboard without worry bumping . Also seat fits perfectly use . This certainly heavy duty stand ! It weighs quite bit , made solid metal , I would hesitate think could hold quite bit weight . However , seems stable side-to-side , spread legs taper much top bottom , I believe would fall quickly bumped front back . This makes nervous live performances close quarter practices . This reasonably robust stand easily carries 88-key keyboard . The spread legs little narrow stage applications , room underneath pedals huge improvement ' X ' stand . It 's really flexible 're planning put top . The small con top surface , might wan na get cheap board throw anything . I put guitar amp head ( around I think ) , two monitor speakers without problem . Love ! 
484	I purchased Peak violin stand n't thrilled height violin bow holder -- tip bow bit close floor comfort . This , designed hold either violin viola , allows height I feel bow safer . Additionally , stand allows violin placed shoulder rest place Peak stand less secure unless I removed shoulder rest . So stand versatile performing situation days home I want violin handy ready play time -- use violin stand cat dog come room violin resting stand .

485	I got I say , disappointed . It 's I went boy 's shop bought large shirt expected fit man . What call medium small ? This `` large pick '' barely goes thumbnail area . I hold , sort , 'll see well works hybrid plectrum project . ( BTW , I 'm average grown man , 5 ' 7 '' , ) More come ... Here go , months later : I chat music store guy found `` large '' thumb pick refers thickness pick ! Bottom line , want thumb pick fits , go store try buy ! Good luck . Iv ' e tried lot thumb picks ( use bass ) doe 's , one 's 'm staying thumb 's . I 've using National medium thumb picks last year last one broke . try Dunlop . Overall - I 'm pleased reviews indicated picks smaller National mediums . This true , n't complete description . Basically , National picks much - nail thumb-pad distance , across nail distance much greater National picks . I actually find Dunlop pick fit much better , I n't get extra National ( tends catch string ) . I wear large sized glove , assuming would translate , I got . While I force thumb , tight uncomfortable ( i.e. , pinches ) . My thumbs n't particularly excessive diameter either . I 'm gon na try heat I stretch bit . I know need snug pick n't rotate used , ridiculous . Three stars fit , nice pick ( would 5 described correctly sizing ) . These items , though well made , strong , sized rather differently National picks - With National , I need Large , I ordered Large item - , however tight , smaller fact National Medium thumb waste money .

487	In past I 've always guessed tight make lug drums . This takes guess work tuning hides . Each setting n't correspond particular octave get sound want least know lugs hide pretty close torque . It 's also easy use.B It confusing first time used . But becomes easier go next drum . Very handy gets job done quickly ! ! I love idea I wish I spent better quality version . I seen used others chose one well made . The number dial accurate loose using keep checking moved . It works I 'll probably end getting better one . If understand , I think 's great idea . Maybe perfect tool I believe supposed well.Keeping mind , I 'm guitar player bought drum kit ... My assumptions using drum tuning & # 34 ; relative & # 34 ; meaning 99 % drum pitch established ear , based want drum sound like , unlike stringed instrument tuned absolute reference frequency string distinct relation others.The concept torque key applying equal tension tension rods therefore presumably equal tune way around circumference head . It means help specific pitch drum ; simply helps achieve even tension & # 8220 ; relative & # 8221 ; pitch around head . The tension numbers torque key reference , 2 tighter 1 , 3 tighter 2 ... . Yet numbers relevant head ; I find n't necessarily pick number 2 tune drums that.The way I use , right wrong , I tune approximate tune given head using traditional method tapping around perimeter tightening rods necessary pitch way around audible frequency I like drum I & # 8217 ; tuning . Now theoretically & # 8217 ; pretty well tuned anyway I grab torque key I set number bit lower I expect torque ( comes experience using times ) I check tension rod I increase setting torque key longer & # 34 ; breaks & # 34 ; . Now , whatever number I 'm reference number drum . My process move around head crisscross pattern would tuning traditionally I loosen rod bit first bring back torque torque key . After process , drum head pitch I chosen ear equal pitch around drum believe common practice use slightly different tension bottom side head ether little tighter looser top side ( typically little lower pitch bottom ? ) . Once & # 8217 ; tuned top head , know number & # 8217 ; used quickly tune bottom reducing increasing click two torque variable come play like , seat head adequately installing essence means apply light pressure center head drawing tension rods small equal amounts crisscross pattern . Also , rims shells , well machined smooth ? These may impact ability torque based tune work . How tension rods , threads clean , lubricated ? Any variability resistance threads torque rods directly translate pitch location . Again , I 'm rookie I may assumptions may essentially unmeasurable impact take 's worth.Once find tuning like , could write number took achieve pitch like head , would make easy quickly get back pitch if/when drums need tuned . would use , plastic around ball scraped away ball flew making useless I purchased key whim . When arrived instructions clear , I sat dial # 2 , loosened lugs floor tom went around lugs using opposing lug patterns , tested first cut tuning . Too loose deep , I increased setting # 3 repeated . Almost sound I wanted , I used regular key went eighth turn using pattern . Perfect . I started next largest tom , working back smallest . Using # 3 setting plus eighth turn I got toms 1/2 octave I worked snare drum , starting snare side , batter side . I used # 4 batter side # 5 snare side , managed get crisp , yet warm , sound I wanted . The bass drum came next - I set batter side tension 1 notch resonant side achieve great tuning . From I went back set resonant sides four toms one notch higher batter side perfect tuning I easy device use - lever facing move left , loosen lugs , tighten starting one two . When lever clicks moves right position reached torque setting . , increase notch necessary , repeat get sound want . Set resonant heads either one notch higher lower make sure batter resonant heads cancel ( desired sound ) , perfectly tuned set.I 'll never go back tuning ear ! You 'll amazed results tune key , n't forget write optimum settings . 
488	This pedal add reverb adjustable different effects , range effects great difference often pronounced . It 's kind & # 34 ; empty & # 34 ; sounding reverb , opposed lush effects . The Reverb Machine ( RV600 ) , also Behringer $ 10 FAR superior machine effects better tone , though couple minor drawbacks . See review item clarification . From product description , I expected something far robust unit . By large , I 've great experiences Behringer pedals , reverb unit wimpiest I ever used 40 years playing - stronger reverb 5w First Act amplifier . I bought one vintage Fender Showman n't built reverb . Put battery plugged . Very simple . But sound horrible ! No setting delivered effect sounded anything like kind reverb I ever heard would want hear . The closest I could get cheesy delay echo effect sounded awful . On hand , reverb Korg ( I using another rig ) great . Maybe DR600 functioning properly , I n't think . I think 's way really sounds . So I got return Amazon ( easy - never fails ) , put back box UPS picked next day I got full refund.JM Tepper I bit surprised negative reviews product . I playing professionaly 35 years time gone many amps , guitars dozens effects sorts . The great ones I kept years ( Ibanez TS9 TS 10 , MXR Compressor etc . ) put small pedal rack n't take much stage room . The one item I n't pedal form good reverb . I great success Behringer rack products ( Digital , EQ 's , patch panels home studio stuff ) . The DR600 first Behringer pedal . I think works great . I 6 months used almost every weekend since I got play jobs band ( often several nights week ) . It given problem . I ca n't speak battery issue since pedal board powered `` One Spot '' multi AC adapter . I ordered pedal based previous 2 reviews , sounds tinnie cheap , plus control knobs bit tight hard adjust . I Behringer pedals many good price , one I wo n't keeping . To , n't even close good Fender amp reverbs ... Behringer usually makes good stuff Reverb Is No different It best Is reverse reverb moderate depth reverb Nothing else . I wanted I Danelectro FAB Echo gives short distance echo I wanted something without slap back I want It Not quite much depth I wanted The Music I Not think Anyone tell . If You want good Reverb Is average much depth get Behringer RV600 Not . The power supply I use Is Danelectro Is great , I also godlyke I use . Yes , 's cheap plastic . Yes , battery life short unit sucks life battery couple hours . Yes , battery difficult replace . However , best sounding cheap reverb pedal planet . I solved battery problem using pedal power supply . It n't sound nearly cheap construction price might suggest . Everything simulated spring reverb endless , sounds great . It even `` modulated '' reverb , reverb slight affecting reverb signal ( dry signal ) version Holy Grail 's `` '' setting . This 1/3 cost Holy Grail , foot switch hold well normal stage use ( unless course , elephant ) . For complaining I hear pedals `` cheap plastic cases '' , I yet hear anyone actually breaking one using . Behringer pedals hit miss , one certainly hit . This `` would '' great digital reverb fact turn level reverb intensity , simultaneously fades initial attach strum , pluck riff rendering reverb relatively worthless lot reverb '' . What hell Behringer thinking ? ? ? 
489	This one many Behringer pedals offer unique , stand-alone sound . The chorus effects well known , even included many amps , featured almost every multi-effects pedal . I like individual pedals I add I want instead relying someone else 's idea pre-set . This Chorus right . It range sounds different situations , reliable well made . There problem B. tough plastic cases . If want metal housing , 's sentimental reason , thinking metal automatically better durable plastic . You need push switch , bat . The chorus effect little weak . I use get sort leslie effect . Clean effect little weak . The adjustment knobs n't seem much either . First let say im using BASS ( least review ) nothing else . That said I products I . This guy really cheap actually `` chorus '' part weak ... chorus ' I ( ART , ZOOM , PEAVEY , , Gibson ) Or could say positive phrase '' subtle '' . The `` stereo '' effect BUT realize I bought item buying switch . Doing saved bundle long run I pay . There high cycle hum background ( almost ALL chorus units end ) . But I say job far splitting signal 2 doesnt seem problem signal delivered . plan using 9volt dc laying around yer bucket think -- -- wont work ... I tried 4 different 9volt dc adapters said I still gota give item : unit made plastic take easy engaging on/off . I take mine apart `` chorus '' wouldnt trigger `` '' . It due fact small strip rubber supposed engage electronics board . may put something behind replace . I love pedal ! That said I would like address reviews I see . I playing guitar since I 14 years old . I 57 I years experience . First guys complain plastic housing . Are jumping effects pedals ? If stop . All gently step switch works . The plastic housing extremely strong wo n't bust used properly . The next thing I would like address battery running & # 34 ; even 's turned & # 34 ; . Every effects pedal I ever owned would run battery leave guitar plugged playing . Get one spot adapter daisy chain . It save fortune . The ones saying sound sucked , buy something besides $ 50 amp , learn put chorus pedal chain . good pedal I 've used stage 2 years without problem . That means I spent $ 11 year pedal earned ! Buy one , learn use 'll happy . First Behringer pedal I returned . Almost effect provided pedal . I returned unit . Not worth . Lousy pedal . hey rockers ! ! ! DO N'T BUY IT IS A GREAT EFFECT IT IS MADE IN , , THAT SHOULD ITS , , THE ONLY BAD THING IS THAT IS , , BUT DO N'T THAT FULL UR EAR ! ! ! THE effects put older brands , , , trust Behringer , get tone sound payed 100 % , , , , chorus wonderful effect lot color tone effect made well thought behind , , versatility well ... say buy . iv using kinds brand effects , , end day like everything else pay name , , times u get may value name , , 's behringer proves effects .. It 's obviously modeling boss super chorus still sounds almost good clear I user likes behringer products . I know plastic ... Com ! It 's $ know pedal ? It 's like BOSS CH-1 plastic version ( durable one way ) . I like Behringer pedals I may bias pedal really adds sound . I really helps pick 
490	This volume pedals . It beautiful , massive , piece metallic magic appears loss tone I run signal . It appears indestructible . I like & # 34 ; tuner output & # 34 ; stiffness pedal action adjusted large slotted screwdriver . When friend offered sell $ 30 bucks I bought without hesitation . I one front system second placed farther right Ditto looper I fade . Volume swells done either pedal slightly different results . If need & # 34 ; light & # 34 ; , maybe keep looking . If n't mind heft , pleased . I like volume pedal beat drop kick hell still works . Why 's overly important volume pedal I 'm sure one built like tank stand beating regular gigging . It takes huge footprint board I generally run end chain side large footprint allows getting whole shoe/boot thing playing . Overall pedal good throw travel n't suck tone like volume pedals . Good It works ok used using volume pedal . I hard time making small volume changes singing . I decided return . It well made , like volume pedals , 's probably one best . I also owned Lil volume pedal . It volume knob allows subtle changes rhythm lead volumes . The Dunlop feature . I bought pedal , tried returned . On plus side , quiet , sturdy , reasonable footprint , suck tone , passive . But feel quite right : Even adjustable tension - I could n't lock I wanted . I 'm used Ernie Ball pedals , I also like new Morley Volume fair , pedal tension pretty personal factor , might easily 5 star product . Outside vintage Show volume pedal - possibly finest volume pedal market today.Very smooth accurate - I like feel unit - sound transparent - I tell signal run volume pedal AFTER pedal board time - I dirty pedal , delay , chorus tuner board time . But I upgrading larger pedal board soon - place volume dirty pedals delay chorus pedals time.The pedal heavy - sturdy - thick rubber pad top - nice rubber bottom covers entire underneath like tank - brushed finish - connections big - I wear 11 1/2 shoe fits foot well - small pedal tension adjustment unit end user dial feel pedal need volume pedal buy one - wo n't sorry . reference I used Ernie Ball - one string - Morley volume pedal - Dunlop Volume pedal finer two - fit , finish , sound , feel using , ease use build quality far exceed pedal market today . 
491	I use ALL time . It 's pretty basic really good beginner . ( Not chords & # 34 ; core & # 34 ; chords ) . Worth price- This Guitar Tuner great useful tool . It teaches chords got play guitar better less one , Austin Garcia I picked one blown cheaply big box store . Who n't need another pocket tuner throw guitar bag , right ? The price less ten bucks , unfortunately n't work well . The microphone inside unit simply accurate . It gets ballpark , barely . note , 's sharp . Play note force says tune . I think Korg tuner roughly price range performs job much better . Very versatile tuner . It automatically tunes string pick tune away ! It also shows chords case forgotten . There things tuner price great buy ! loved thing , I since lost , happens little like , lol . worked good . pretty precise , meaning fight happy . sometimes felt little , robots know best , right ? I suing item regular basis tune guitar , seems work fine , complains Had guitar years , , always tune never time practice , tells note actually played string tune zero correct one Very compact size easy use.Good feature price.Shipping happy product.Best recommended . It works great , much I say beyond . 
492	This good looking strap . Much lighter thinner strap I . It half weight others makes great price right well.I like fender quality strap . cheap , extremely low quality strap . I 've months guitar fallen yet , I see wear end 's almost breaking point . I would recommend . It 's ok emergency strap get jam , nothing else . I decided get tweed strap 50s Telecaster Classic , arrived , I bit let . The tweed finish cool enough , strap thin , strap ends pretty poor quality . If truly made leather , I feel sorry hide came . The leather hard , almost need fingers steel get eyelets spread far enough apart get around guitar strap decent time , I definitely going keep eye something suitable guitar . Feels like wearing $ 10 Casio $ 1300 suit ... The tweed really grips shirt , quality perfection even give little string , using acoustic I thought sweet ! Love fender . Not flashy strap great studio stage need change guitars weight allows remove quickly.It pretty comfortable wear also . I three straps Strats . Very comfortable durable . I really like metal link opposed plastic link hold strap leather button hole . Great product ! For price pretty nice strap . It 's thin job well . The simulated leather end pieces noticeably & # 34 ; cheap & # 34 ; guitar strap failed yet : ) I used buy leather straps . This strap nice comfortable . It 's also cheapest one I ever bought . Ca n't go wrong . Not much say ... I wanted tweed guitar strap exact item sights . Thanks , 's meant ! For price wonderful strap . It get twisted wear , keep straight last long time . It vintage look , soft comfortable . It also vintage Fender factor . I 30+ year old leather straps around years I 'm gone I paid lot 're comfortable . I 've even used Gibson 's ( oh , shame ) course look best Fender 's , I guess . The truth work anything . The strap ends great , 're really secure . take care . I quite 're great quality , look cool ( vintage kinda way ) feel soft shoulder . I chose good looks , pleased construction well . A well-made strap great looks super price . My complaint , minor , I think webbing could thicker sturdy feel . It feels lighter I like , 's personal thing . I complaints construction , looks price . I use mine Irish bouzouki , really looks great works great . I n't like straps smooth allow strap slide around . This cloth n't slide around , 's good thing . Sorry Fender ... one waste money . Get something better n't twist ravel knots . , amazing strap . Very soft , confortable , sits fender strap lock , looks like G & L Custom Fender Select Case . What else , ? I gotten comments cool looks , I 'm finding I prefer thicker strap , strap works perfectly 
493	I bought Pedaltrain pedal board I 6 individual stomp boxes crammed onto . I originally bought Hosa connectors high quality low profile , selection lengths limited . I bought kit little trepidation proceeded re-do board . I swear I done 20 minutes ! ! The board looks awesome cables cut perfect length . These cables dead silent connectors high quality . The supplied cutting tool works described thing need small-tip , flathead screwdriver medium size handle firmly drive locking screw cable final step . I could saved money I bought first instead bunch random length patch cables . The good thing Cable Station make cables custom lengths neater pedal board without need solder connections place . All cut cable flush , insert `` plug twisting motion , turn setscrew side plug tight.As benefit , shorting signal need find offending cable , remove plug , cut cable , insert end back plug.Great right ? Well , really.As far reliability goes , nothing really replace connection properly soldered . With money spend , could easily get decent soldering iron , old cable , cheap plugs Radio Shack practice . In end , bulk cable connectors make needed.I used product re-cut several cables different times cables constantly moved around . The ones permanent given trouble , I experienced problems past . Always spares tested.Another annoying thing give cable connectors , I would think 15 connectors would sufficient.Is easier soldering ? reliable ? For part , yes.Will I continue using product ? Yes , I usually spares.Why I use ? I 'm Cleartone cables website gold connectors : waste money asked pay extra gold plated connectors . The thin soft gold ( 5-10 ) . plating looks cool , scrapes easily brass underneath stops seeing gold worn ! The brass eventually tarnishes causes crackling plug moves twists socket true gold good conductor electricity mated gold plated socket . But sockets inside guitar amplifier guitar usually gold , virtually benefit gold plated plugs . I tech well guitar player . I also spent time past soldering . But cables seem well made good solderless connections . Most us know 's lot hype really comes Good Quality Cable ( This Seems ) Good Stable ( These seem ) & connections two last ( Time tell ) . All I know I Hand Special plugs Good Cable break use I expect especially high use situation plugged & unplugged I know signal clean & Not bleed f highs & critical They Very Easy use & done Stage sets quickly NO & I Love ! I definitely use unless I find longevity problem.LM Very good quality cable plugs . Easy make custom length cables 3 inches 30 ft. My pedal board looks professional uncluttered I actually made room 1 extra wire get way . This one favorite music purchases . Cleans gear 's appearance tremendously . Very easy use lots extra cable length . What I say ? I started couple pedals , wah , , board , sooner later 6 & # 34 ; cords either way , short whatever . I like offset connectors bring pedals together sometimes board 've got odd distances . This kit trick , truly easy use . Only I create plug bad connection redo . 
494	This Fender cable perfect length ! Sometimes I find bit long I n't mind . The build quality great I know last . The gripe I cable metal sleeve gets unscrewed way easily , requiring tighten quality affected , color cool , definitely try cable . wanted looks alone ... It nice looking cord ... I know perform ... Sam Ash ... cord packed mailer inside another box n ... shipping team great work..never complaints ... I love Sam thanks Amazon I 've using cables 4 months holding pretty well . For years I used seemingly indestructable guitar cables made electrician friend . When finally gave , I got habit using no-name cables always display near register Guitar really impulse buy something I put thought . After third fourth Guitar Center cable failed light use I decided try cables . Not cheaper seem holding better . I terribly hard gear cables tend get twisted I move around cheaper ones eventually fail . I n't mind spending extra dollars cable little durable . This cable actually $ 12 shipped- 's holding pretty well . These actually reasonably priced 18 ' cables . There kind limited life warantee product I n't needed . Five stars nicely made 18 foot guitar cable costs $ 12 shipped ! Incidentally- cables shielded meant connect instrument amp 's input . Do use connect amplifier speaker cab . You want use unshielded cables purpose.Edit- More 6 months passed cable functioning without issues . The price things gone significantly although cable highly recommended , probably better values Hosa , Monster Planet Fender cords look great work well . By adding word California description I 'm sure sound like Beach ... This cool looking cheap cable works well . I bent one connectors pretty badly fault . One thing consider cable tighten connectors awhile . You 'll able hear rattle . It seems ' look screw connectors black rubber , , cable looks cool works well.I also shorter red cable goes one guitars perfectly . I bought theses use practicing others use black cables . It 's easier plug different amps without cutting someone accident . The green cable good . The Fender 18 Feet California Clear Instrument Cable - Lake Placid Blue good extra cord good price . Very good cable . Well made looks great Candy Apple Red Tele . The reason I gave 4 stars tends lay flat floor . 
495	Strings half battle stringed instruments . A bad pair strings nice instrument sound awful , good pair strings make cheaper instrument sound tremendously better . Either way , stringes drastically effect sound instrument price point . These strings make cheap ukulele sound not-so-cheap , I imagine would even wonders uke higher price point . I also play guitar Martin one choice brands strings I figured would n't let I decided play ukulele - I correct . .I BOUGHT A UKULELE TO AS A . I KNEW THE STRINGS THAT COME ON NEW MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS WOULD BE OF QUALITY SO I THESE MARTIN STRINGS AS A . I 'VE USED MARTIN INSTRUMENTS FOR MANY YEARS , AM OF THE MAKE AND QUALITY OF THE MARTIN . THIS WAS AN EASY CHOICE FOR ME . THERE ARE OTHER EXCELLENT STRINGS . THIS JUST WAS MY CHOICE THIS TIME . I 've playing uke since became popular must confess I quiver full things ( ranging plywood beaters solid wood art object electric ) . Over years , I 've tried several different brands string . The truth nothing wrong . It 's Martin strings seem little bit compliant others allows tease bit articulation tone . Given string changing frequent multiple instruments fuel , Martin string set 's relatively low cost nice bonus . Great guitar companies n't always make ( sell ) best strings . I love Teles I ca n't stand Fender strings . Likewise , I love Martin ukulele , trying strings second time , I conclusion I first ; Aquila 's far better . Aquila 's organic feel fuller , richer sound . The Martins begin hold tune sooner - Aquila 's take couple days - sound thinner feel n't nearly friendly . The approximately 3 dollar price difference , , worth lesser satisfaction , even least expensive ukes . Considering seldom one usually changes uke strings , Aquila 's still seem worth extra couple bucks . Use Martin 's ( cheaper string ) working uke , put stress repeatedly de-tuning re-tuning . Then switch Aquila 's playing . Some may like Martins wo n't love Aquila 's . Great replacement string ukulele , great hand case replace strings get uku . 
496	This pedal solidly built , works advertised . If 're using strictly volume pedal , job problem use expression pedal -- polarity switch expression gear expression pedal ( Digitech , example ) , position muted position full volume ( opposite ) , wah effects backwards well . There 's way correct without making crossover cable ( requires destroying perfectly good patch cable ) . I got pedal recently . All , 's pretty nice device , price . Seems solid well-made . It nice big pedal big feet . It works smoothly . I found drawbacks operation quality pedal . My gripe , power pedal either internal 9V battery , 12V plug power supply . Why difference ? The really bad part ( ) I bought install Behringer pedal board , comes 9V power supply . So , order use pedal board , I run two different power supplies , run pedal battery everything else pedalboard 's power supply . [ Behringer ... thought well . ] I 'm process making voltage adapter , finding right parts proven far hassle . Bottom line : pedal great , power supply thing could frustration you.One final note Behringer ... seem get bad marks . I really n't understand . I two Behringer amps , two stomp boxes , pedal board , volume pedal discussed . I really like . I never problem items . They perform well , well made , certainly , came reasonable price . Behringer 's full range products extensive , I see little reason buy brand . I 'm sticking . The pedal works perfectly fine . Using foot pedal controller Korg . Needs WD-40 : ) Great foot switch easy use . I figured whole body expose battery compartment . Wish put instructions . If 's I missed . Pedal working , making noise . Poor quality looks like used pedal , like n't recommend product . The power supply included funky size , seem work standard pedal power supply I would n't recommend proper size . The guy using using Fender Telecaster , single 12 & # 34 ; tube amp . He found volume cut ~ 15-20 % even pedal turned way . Any time pedal allows volume loss , tends effect tone & yes , Mr. Sound Engineer , & # 34 ; tone & # 34 ; real thing ! The pedal pretty bulky wo n't fit well pedal boards , 's wide Morley , seems taller , longer , gave 3 stars , & # 34 ; It 's Okay & # 34 ; , far great , I would buy product . I understand price cheap , afford , go , extra cheese , spread . All I got ta say product I get volume/tone loss 's plugged ; big problem . Other well built , fact decreases volume major issue . This good pedal overall , rare see stereo pedal price I took chance I 'm pleased . As said , low range quite steep slope , uncomfortable foot angle . But 's big pedal , pivot seems right spot I go lower ranges toes action smooth . I wish TS jacks top/bottom instead side side , seems would take 1/4 right angle connectors better . One gets way . Or even better TRS jack 'd need one input . I might modify . In acoustic guitar band , I often play intros solos heavily amped , rest band members come , strumming rest . So I needed way throttle back either nothing slightly amplified intros solos apply full power needed . This volume control foot pedal works exactly described . Also , I extra 12 volt router wall wart saves battery life practice ( I use battery gigs ) . Despite comments I 've seen , battery extremely easy change - problem ! The device reduce signal going amp ; hence 4 stars . Used foot pedal far I 've know problems . Replaced battery . Good product inexpensive foot pedal . I share another reviewer 's opinion pedal comfortable certain treadle angles . However , little output lower positions , I n't find issue . In fact I rarely feel need use full travel treadle volume swells . I thought bit strange thing specifies 12 volt AC adapter yet powered 9 volt battery . So ... I decided see I would issues I used One-Spot AC adapter - polarity corrected , course . It worked fine . I usually power looper adapter I built splitter cable labeled , polarity specific terminations everything worked fine . My curiosity n't end though . I wanted know would discernible difference I used 12 volt power supply . I difference I could find power indicator LED wee bit dimmer using 9 volt adapter . There change sonics whatsoever , reduction output volume I could hear . So 's 12 volt adapter spec , Behringer ? Did think could fool us ? I give four stars even though n't use pedal 's full sweep , comfortable lower positions . I 'll probably get used eventually . The travel would tolerable sitting position ... , I stand front mic stage . The pedal generates lot & # 34 ; noise & # 34 ; I ca n't use . You get pay . King Vox Dunlop High Gain , passive , passed test , I 'm pretty picky ! I bit skeptical purchasing pedal based reviews , however problems seemed related using volume pedal opposed expression pedal . I wanted I could pair RE-20 control intensity , aspect , I confirm works/pairs flawlessly . My complaint pedal seems extremely sensitive . For example ; I tested using expression pedal control filter VST synthesizer , recognized mapped without issue , rocking pedal ever-so-slightly would cause erratic movement filter . This behavior I connected RE-20 , slightest pedal movement make intensity repeat rate jump fashion 's anything gradual . It 's end world , I hoping movement would bit precise . I purchased extra CV controller Digitech Control 2 . When I got , I tried volume pedal kicks YES suck tone right signal . As far CV ? sucks ! Why ? squeaks move ( 5 minutes use , right box ) . Behringer joke gives German engineering bad name ( although ' Germany ) .It 's direct copy Yamaha I purchase one see compares . I 'm betting extra 45 dollars well worth it.Also , may say `` cares squeaks little '' ? well I I controlling volume swells ' effect low volume studio ! Good luck buy .

498	Works . Nice materials I think durable . Simple attach mic stand adjust needed . It improve recordings , getting pops sssss sound without sound processing much anyway . great easily setup time feel perfectly stop P 's , n't know time keep distance issue I 'm familiar pop filters actually work , apart getting rid unnecessary peaks recording . I noticed improvement recording quality pop filter . I n't know compares pop filters though , one seems like works . What difference pop filter makes , I use condenser mic , lets get little gain input , clamps easy holds good , flex piece holding filter could little rigid job . I like way looks mounted mic stand extension , It improved vocal tracks . Just one affordable improvement home studio . Great quality construction . Does 's job well . Only complaint design little streamline . These bolt attitude bit heavy . Overall , stays place 's job well . A workhorse sure . Do n't even hesitate buying thing . It 's everything need . It 's pop filter . It clamps anything n't inch half thickness.It gets job done . Buy . For price , perfect pop filter ... really good length clamp decent , hope last awhile ... When I bought I looking pop filters use pair condenser microphones help keep wind pops ruining recording . Once position work fine , problem getting position harder looks . The device clamps onto microphone stand adjust goose neck get filter need . The filter goose neck fairly heavy often struggle get filter I wanted keep there.On plus side , device looks nice professional held three years use . complaints . attaches firmly job . Ca n't beat price . Order eyes closed . Great deal . It works pop filter huge upgrade make-shift panty hose pop filter . What else say ? Pop filter works great . This really eliminated many subtle flaws I audio recording . Granted , make make-shift pop filter using hollow ring nylon . But adjustable clamp really ... well adjustable fits many unique mic placement situations . Plus , although flexible , also sturdy n't worry vibration noises coming . filter works well looks professional . problem clamp seems work specifically mic stand similar type structure . thing n't seem stay ! mean , change position pop filter varying shape metallic & # 34 ; arm & # 34 ; , n't stay put . also material filter kinda poor quality . , think 're lucky might get job done . This works fine , although mount bit weird ... I see . As pop filter works perfectly I able hear clarity loss sound coloring . Just pop filtering black pantyhose ! ! lol I purchased reading great reviews like comments lately thing good . Looked almost used arrived gooseneck stand useless . Does come even close able hold weight filter . I would returned I completely destroyed package getting open ( oddly staples holding closed ) . little guy help record Apogee One voices amps , prevent shock diaphragm ... wan na excellent recordings ? get one ! wind screen way big bulky useless , screen came , thinking back went ebay bought 2 metal mesh pop filters cheaper MUCH better ... avoid ! ! Wow reviews thing little ridiculous eh ? Some people pay silver expect gold ; ) Okay , I bought I app review videos blog Blue Snowball mic picking awful `` pop '' sounds supposed filter `` hard P , hard T , hard B , S , others . '' So I got . Here pros cons : . It works . I tested Sony Vegas pro without filter . The `` pop '' sound completely removed filter . Which means designed . 5-stars . It affect voice volume , smooths rough edges speech : . It looks nice . Blue Snowball , looks like professional product . It n't really matter since I work home public place , 's nice know I show people `` looks nice '' 3 . The clamp , bendable arm , everything work appropriately . The clamp designed hold onto bar flat surface . So mounting , say , desk probably wo n't stable attached round thing , like stem . I n't know people think `` n't sturdy '' ... I mean 're going local rink playing darn thing . The build quality quite excellent considering 's 2 fragile screens attached plastic . It 's pretty big . I used shorten stem Blue Snowball stash hole desk easy storage . I ca n't anymore pop filter . Now 's become permanent member front thing doubling space Snowball takes , I complaints pop filter . It works well , attaches nicely , supposed , looks nice , quality good . This last pop filter I buy long time . Filter good size ( 6 '' ) easily comes apart changing fabric ( I probably use panty hose ) gets torn . Other works said I ordered product use personal recording , thought ... could possibly go wrong ? I ordered `` New , '' definitely shows signs new . First , package stapled , 's right- together way could tell product opened . Then , make matters worse , hole one side fabric . When I order something new , I expect new . Based product alone , I would recommend buying seller . What headline says . It exactly 's supposed . Removes annoying popping P 's recordings . Until afford Sennheiser condenser microphone built pop filter 're going need . And price right . keeps spit mic looks cool recording - great keeping mouth mic dont breath fits great stands easy clamp Yes , make pop filter home , n't want . Why else would reading ? Besides , wo n't look good.I 've purchased three pop filters thus far last four months . The recent one I purchased NOT one . I wish . I thought I 'd try something different , see differences . Well , I tell significant differences , others featured bottom clamp one features rubber piece grips metal pole attach . The competitors I 've tried . If rubber piece , clamp tend slip pole grip properly . This huge mistake makes using pop filter boom stand impossible . Fortunately , Nady placed rubber piece 's clamp never issue.The complaint I screen actually popped plastic ring couple times . A single dot superglue fixed that.Compared pop filters I 've seen used , one perfectly suited microphone reasonable price ca n't beat yes , pop filters ARE A MUST condenser microphones . Just buy one , save trouble . It 's supposed . It 's well made , I think . They look cheap , unless get studio professional grade . The screen pops easily , pop back . It works well home recording . Picked A Pack Purple Peppers - test passed , & # 34 ; puh & # 34 ; sound found recording . This decent pop filter . It gets job done flaws . It attracts good amount dust , screen tends mess ( caused tear first screen ) , & goose neck tends unwrap 's self place . It also gets shakey I tend screw back . Other , 's decent pop filter price . Under $ 10 would 've better . I went something cheaper $ 20 *cough cough* pop filter *cough cough* , I future . stay place well . I read several reviews pop filters Amazon surprised dissatisfied many . Finally I went one I 'm pretty happy . It seems quite servicable . It double filter attaches stand well enough . The arm little weak stay put n't bump . I guess balance stiffness ease possitioning . I think possitioning would little easier arm little stiffer.I blow directly ( quite hard blowing cake full ) I feel nothing side hear wind rumble , I 'm gon na keep use rots gets lost . Though I 'd warn n't know audio mean place mic right front pop filter magically whole thing , pop filter slightly off-center placement seems keep majority pops 's making appearance way . works well , keeps popping bare minimum , easy install , cleans flash , lightweight works I lot podcasts dubbing videos , using filter , pop occurs P 's B 's voice basically gone . It makes audio professional eliminate . When record singing , need prevent pop sound . It definitely worth . It also makes looks professional . This pop-filter rocks . I like lot , well compared lots filters I tried . It 's got nice look . Use home recordings voice recordings work . I like long neck double filter get tad bit extra . I tested single filter make difference , expected . It makes sense additional layer filter effectively , I wasnt sure would effect tone highs , I didnt notice either effected . This great investment home studio . I 've able eliminate majority pops coming Condenser Microphone . I bought long time ago ! ! I use Audio Technica 2020 , work well , filter stays place really improves quality recording . Not much else say . works well wish bit heavier construction little better made . works intended . I love pop filter ! It every n't scratch mic stand pop filter clamps . The adjustable arm flexible , yet sturdy assure proper pop filter placement . For price , one best pop filters . It easily clamps onto stand n't move around I place . However , one problem I 've . It easily lose grip arm holding filter . What I mean , I pick mic , arm swivel away . Granted caused dropping , fine . So good price get filter works . Tested Blue Yeti USB Microphone could tell difference POP filter right away . Good investment . There many required words type product n't need much explanation . It mounts mic stand position need . sturdy . A needed accessory vocal recording , period . My gripe model straight bracket part needs stick dang far , since bend arm position anyway . Well thought unit says , drop POP ! I really like way clamp connector rubberized protect finish mic stand . And rubberized , allows adjust filter mic without loosen everything rubber inherent & # 34 ; & # 34 ; And flexible arm allows fine tune filters proximity singer , allowing best -- ! And ; really important part : everything stays last left . Hell , even cats ca n't , 're porcelain . Good solid construction .

501	These high quality cables , construction wise audio quality . I use shorter cables I run bits rack external , ie : unplugging plugging lot , I find cables stand abuse average cable . I 'm satisfied . Good Quality cable price . Works good expensive 99 make noise Sometimes I run longer cable snake I 'm big band thing . Otherwise , I use cable every show . Love . Looks vintage works great great price . As good better Monster cable lot less money ! This second Spectraflex cable I love . I love flexibility , options colors ends , build quality price . I like use quality guitar cables good sound I n't need spend fortune run stage roadies ripped cable costs guitars . got short cord go amp waa ! It works perfect I Spectraflex cables fine Rugged ends flexible seem like cable hold well , tangle real plus tend move around lot , connectors seem heavy duty , time tell I would assume cable last long time . After suffering crackles , lost signals , rest , I decided numerous positive reviews Spectraflex tweed cable purchase one Amazon.com . Because new acoustic-electric classical I received gift end-pin outlet , I bought Spectraflex right angle connector . Although I using cable weeks , I impressed . The connections guitars basses I 've used sure , loss signal , crackles . Perhaps impressive fact I turn right angle connector around never change signal . Finally , I confident I play , something consistently come amplifier . By way , old-school tweed look plus , . Well , I say ? Based customer reviews , purchase seemed like no-brainer . However , 4 months light use ( used rig home ) toast . The cable barely holds signal ( constantly need jiggle thing work ) . And ask , & # 34 ; perhaps output jack ? & # 34 ; , cables work . So definitely cable : ( Anyway , I gave 2 stars WAS working sounded great Roland . Spectraflex makes great cables . I bought right angle 10 ' red cable older Ibanez guitar . This cable built extremely durable , made USA , comes lifetime warrantee . The 20 gauge construction rugged nylon makes low noise cable , connectors secure feel quite substantial ( especially compared cheaper Fender cable I using required almost constant tightening . ) Though Spectraflex cables least expensive ( expensive , ) great value I definitely fan . I recommend cable without reservations . I purchased three ( three different colors ) make keyboard 's . I typically used Mogami , need road ( I usually roll exact length ) . These worked well , quiet , handling noise , seem well built ( I treat cables well , I n't really test tough circumstances ) hopefully remain spot foreseeable future . They used 6 nights week , 50 uses , problems . I recommend ( plus , live , fabric cables different colors great easily identifying road crew member might know audio well. ) . Nice pieces ... I keep cable pedal board -Pedaltrain MINI With Soft Case . I 've posted photo pedaltrain Mini page . The right angle connector great last pedal board straight connector goes amp . I use Mogami silent cable Platinum Guitar 12 , Straight Straight Quiet Plug 12 input guitar , I ca n't justify paying LOT money side goes amp ( 's getting bumped around , plugged unplugged , etc. ) . This cable works perfect 's purpose . Oh yeah ... matches tweed amp ! ! This pretty strong cable . I wanted something I plug top loaded amp jack would stand case I 'm sitting amp . angle job . seams strong , seams like last . I bought two run amp lone pedal effect I use bass . The 90 degree ends go pedal makes smart looking setup . I 'm pleased . I 've owned months . No issues look good . I 'm professional musician love cables , look great perform great feel lot tougher rubber covered cables I 've using This become number one cable Carvin bass . I gig couple times per week rock solid . I use something different I need longer reach . And I love tweed cover . Very satisfied one . 
502	The Gain mic n't greatest , speeches soft recordings : guy handle well ! I Shure SM58s cost . I like open sound vocals seem break higher volumes SM58s . I like mic ok SM58 worth extra money I think , especially expect push capability . I test recording digitally get better Idea learning process side . It gives clean crisp reproduction every flaw I . I use Video guitar instruction website . It 's perfect vocals , podcasting , video recording forth . Shure makes excellent stuff . What 's also great save money XLR cable included . I 'm happy purchase . 4 stars instead 5 thing wo n't tune guitar carry amp . I use solo , duo bass player , trio drums bass . I regular gig medium sized club basically one large room . I use Pyle Pro self contained I also plug Martin . The sound quality excellent . The volume seems limited Pyle Pro put . I would hesitation using bigger rooms full band PA . I n't heard hint feedback on/off switch plus.The price might seem good true think things paying less used . I bought 32 & # 34 ; Toshiba flat screen around 230 bucks , Think would cost even five years ago less . The true lot Audio Gear . A lot companies bringing high quality music market 's great company like Shure make something good affordable . They always made high quality product one almost anyone afford . I recommend strongly enough . 
503	Every issue I Mackie support.They seriously 'm using simple weigh station DAW Tascam 16 track.So far , problems . I using since day arrived , easy setup although windows 8 reads device speaker USB work way . It great sound I pleased . I first bought Yamaha MG102c mixer , arrived defective I returned bought impression ProFX8 good . It 's lot , knobs constructed much better.For example , knobs dent MG102c n't line well , degrees . But ProFX8 every dented knob line beautifully pointing . Knob turning pressure also consistent like EQ Main output . As well mute every channel . FX effects okay , turn fx knob way feel using USB recording ( Audacity ) noticeable buzz sound along side recording , regardless microphone channel turned preamp so-so I guess . I AKG SM58 , mics I turn gain channel volume 90 % get decent function perfectly . Runs little bit hot side . Power cable kinda short , may want look longer one . I could happier ... Excellent sound , easy controls , responsive better advertised . The effects excellent , feel quality parts wonderful . Buy . By , probably read problem USB connection generating high pitch sound recording making USB functionality unusable ( Amazon reviewer referred `` fatal flaw , '' I heartily agree ) . I experienced , read folks struggling issue Mackie support blogs . When I called Mackie support seek fix , I told problem well known newer lots corrected new hardware . They sent new Mackie Board newer lots , I returned old one . I problems USB functionality since . I thankful Mackie great customer service , especially since I addressed problem one year warranty 'm assuming purchases made problem , , contact Mackie get replacement.At point , I still running board paces , thus far good .

505	signal without much noise , though totally quiet . Good lead w/ single channel amps ; boosting signal effects vary depending signal strength -- especially lower practice volumes . Should INEXPENSIVE ! I bought pedal give single coils heat . It ( dial set 10 o'clock ) . However , I could see tone purist really bothered mid range coloration pedal . In situations , high volumes , n't bother much . In studio , I wo n't use pedal reason . It right price , right . If want transparent boost , got ta pay more.One thing ... boost pedal really shines 's running tube amp extra something . I n't think pushing input digital amp good idea sound 's sake . Just thought . This simple preamp booster adds bit dirt looking clean boost n't try something else . I find This best used push front end tube amp . really similar overdrive except boosts normal one good cutting mix solo fattening single coil pickups . overall great pedal amazing price highly recommended . Ok ... I bought placing pedalboard . I mean I enough boost gain different pedals already use moment . I gave friend mine simple pedal configuration ( distortion flanger ) made huge difference needed make solo bring `` accent '' part song.It 's cool pedal I recommend simple pedal configurations . It bring extra juice I pretty much leave time . It gives good boost body tone , distorted dirty , want type sound get it.Great price . I originally bought pedal boost old amplifier signal works suprisingly well . I wanted boost n't color tone worked well needs . The price good , I bought locally price I bought pedal , I upgraded speaker old amp still use boost speaker use pedals . The tone transparent boosting pedal output great . I use distortion overdrive good results.I found new uses pedals suffer volume drop putting front . All , besides good EQ pedal , boost effective worth every penny . I shower enough praise LPB-1 . It currently sells $ 40 improves sound combined pedal ( especially overdrive/distortion pedals ) . I keep time , since always improves sound-quality . 
506	I use acoustic Washburn , stay bright weeks . I playing guitar 30 years , best . Great Light strings guitar . Really impressed PolyWeb ! These easy fingers polyweb n't sqeek . My son plays electric acoustic guitar . He uses Elixir swears . He brands , n't stand elixir . What gain string life strings loose tone . I 'm saying tone bad , 's good quality strings coat . That said , I 'm pleased string guitar practice . They last months without change tone . I ; play much public venues , problem change strings I . These strings actually save money n't change em much . I keep em year I play alot , door indoor . constant abuse . never rust . When break I change 'm player likes new strings begin I like change really hold . There better sounding strings yes . But plugin anyway , tweak tone.The tone n't bad , good martin uncoated string.but like longevity less squeak . great . 
507	I thought I could take smell . I would decent deal bad sounding.The case nice , everything smells like Chinese rubber smell Tools . ( sulfur ? ) I tried airing week success.If sense smell , get one . This great guitar change strings , suggested . Great portability price.HOWEVER - read reviews across multiple sites , I victim HORRIBLE glue smell many others complained . I really liked guitar , I purhcased two separate retailers , return due smell . I even tried contacting manufacturer send `` smell-free '' case ... And sent case . But stunk . It 's shame , I return , nice little guitars . Do n't expect sound like regular guitar wo n't disappointed . That said , I find useful composing road . Heck , even sounds better big guitars , odd way , certain songs . Nice sturdy portable case . Not good overheads airplanes takes space several bags , flight usually store locker front ask . Action adequate practice -- little tweaking 's actually good . Quiet enough play hotel room disturb neighbors . I 've playing mostly acoustics 30 years , I D35 Martin , Epiphone DR-212 , Zager , American Fender Strat , Gibson Studio Les Paul owned many others . When Little Red Traveler showed door I excited , expectation bar n't set high . I unpacked Traveler gave , , WOW , nicely made . Neck perfect , slightest bow , frets finished better Gibson I bought . I found wet/dry sand paper , I think 200 grit spent 10-15 minutes sanding bottom bridge bone . WOW # 2 action much average acoustic guitar quality , buzz , perfect pitch octave joy play . The tone unique , quiet , unless expecting Martin sound , definitely offensive . The sound kind acoustic guitar/ukulele , banjo ish . I 'm thinking nice pickup would make quite acoustic lead instrument . Plays great top fret . love ! Unbelievable instrument , pleasure play . Oh case $ 40+ ; ) ) ) Buy one , happy . One last thing , another post mentioned putting right arm outside strap tying tuning keys , works well . I wanted guitar I could travel , something small enough I actually would carry around novelty wore . This great size . I love large neck size , smaller full size guitar , wont feel much playing . The sound something size really good , expect get full acoustic sound . This guitar practice scales , practice tune.. wont performing guitar . I alot research bought cheap travel guitar ( I hated , threw ) decided I wanted better one , compared Martin Backpacker better sound , better bag , around GREAT travel guitar . The travel case great , size violin case know size.. We got save trunk space traveling guitar . As expected , n't sound quality full-size instrument , sounds good . It seems hold tune well son enjoys playing . The blue color pretty , pleased extras guitar ( case , strap , etc ) . Other people mentioned odor case strap . We notice scent , n't bother anyone . A person might feel differently . I looking portable guitar would survive rigors Afganistan . I going get Martin Backpacker , I actually seen held store , reviews sold Washburn . The case particular positive point , 25 % lower price . I please I received . The case great traveling soldier , rugged protective , useful pockets . The Guitar well made , nice pegs solidly built inexpensive instrument . It bit banjo like sound small body , common type , initial awkwardness figuring hold , since full sized fretboard tiny body , ca n't exactly rest leg like regular acoustic . The thing , guitar plain fun , always handy , durable , plays pretty well . Best buy I made product I could n't try first . A testament quality reviews Amazon , rarely led . Picked Blue Steel lite stings brass abalone pins enhance tone . Also last pick $ shipped door . If like parlor guitar , might . The case kick ass , easily $ 50 value.Update : After putting brass pins adding snark tuner , along putting new strings , guitar rocks . Putting brass pins keeps top heavy helps improve tone . This go-to guitar . Sounds good great intonation . The upgrade would get closed geared tunners open geared work fine hold tunning . I washburn love much 1/3 cost .

510	Wanted way plug BOSS ME70 save batteries . Did n't want drop money BOSS PSA , I got one instead job , less money . Bought using Danelectro mini amp , I n't need worry battery . It works perfectly adaptor , & wo n't surprise performance . : ) two stars comparing price mini amp ( less $ 20 ) , adaptor pricy ( $ ) , still saves $ $ long runs . I got power Danelectro Honeytone amp since eats batteries like candy . It 's power adaptor , n't exciting , works fine . I use mostly Honeytone mini amplifier Echo tape echo simulator . Works well problems . A lot pedals may eat batteries great alternative access voltage outlets . I problems Ego Compressor comp getting noisey , sent back found It Had using slightly drained battery , I got one great , nice quiet , half price boss one . This best little guitar pedal adapter I 've used , I 've used many last three decades . It 's exceptionally quiet , many , puts 9.6 volts , drive pedals little solidly brand new alkaline battery . And wo n't buy new one every dozen hours ! I 've used splitter drive three pedals , four I hear current drop bit . Still , 's good thing reminds tone comes fingers , box floor . But sure nice delay , little extra gain driving tubes , best 9v adapter pedals available I know , including Boss ones . Dan released cool , well-made pedals past 15 years , little wall wart worthy good deal 15 clams . As stated title , adapter need use Danelectro lot going many batteries . You plug wall ! As advertised , keeps electric current hum minimum functioned fine year I 've owned . The reason I took one star wire really thin n't seem durable , I careful n't get broken . You might able find off-brand adapter cheaper one made Honeytone wo n't risk ruining . ... must Danelectro/FAB pedals . As anyone one pedals knows eat 9-volts like candy , solution . You get one hook power splitter ( Search Visual Sound One Spot Multi-Plug 5 Cable ) good go 5 pedals ! No battery swaps , searching 9-volt every 5 minutes ... What I say lower priced low distortion I could Not hear hum multi pedals save cost I use godlyke power supply Is good power pack . Got use Behringer compressor I ordered . They indicated compatible worked great ! Price right . I already two problems . Quiet . No . Buy need wall wart . 
511	This fantastic little recorder , $ 300 . I bought mine used $ 75 bass player 's forum section . That 3 years ago . It recorded almost every show I play , gigs month , plus couple rehearsals . I record learning purposes , sometimes make rough demo 's ( audio better audio ! ) come really appreciate little gadget . The interface perfect little bit learning curve settings , use Automatic Gain Control ( AGC ) setting , recording level taken care . I use Audacity amplify necessary , normalize always , edit .wav .mp3 . Its pretty easy I sound tech I studio unplug powering , problem . Just pull SD card , insert computer , save files computer .raw files changing extension ( first make copy original file make mistake backup ) import file Audacity .raw file . From edit normal save edited songs .mp3 files . I 've several years . It worked flawlessly . It done pretty good job many recordings , especially field . Zoom upgraded unit models market superior . At time first came one best market price class . I owned product & awesome features . This little Recorder absolutely amazing 's size . Takes practice appreciate features . I recommended Recorder fellow musician friend & bought one also Amazon & loves & records gigs instead old huge unit using & told much better job old unit . He even used tripod record service family keep memories loved one . I bought records well even whisper pretty far away . Excellent recording acoustic 's Finally , product simple use point-and-shoot camera . Literally , I opened box , put two batteries , memory card , read quick-start guide , put Zoom included stand , got mandolin started recording . The sound quality great , play back directly Zoom plugging ( included ) . The control buttons operate like DVD remote , `` menu '' button , using `` '' `` reverse '' scroll entries , `` record '' button `` set '' .For someone well-versed audio terminology , gain , sampling rates , mics , pre-post amps , levels whatever , I set medium gain , watched make sure lines n't go far , recording away two steps . Push `` record '' test gain level , push `` record '' , ( red light stays ) , record , push `` record '' stop . The file saved , push play/pause listen back . files extra steps know program use puppy.It also handy , portable easy take places . I take record jam sessions , music lessons , practice evaluate playing , instrument comparisons . The sound quality great , I could hear resonant clear mandolin . I wish playing great since recorded pick noise , finger slide noise , assorted twangs twings . It records WAV ( huge files ) mp3 ( compressed ) , various quality levels choose . You easily connect computer ( ) included USB cable.The thing missing remote . Since push button recorder , move . Also picks noise movements . But price $ 199 , 's real always look one thing product surprise , n't cost lot customer . On one , included wind sock , tiny foam cap slip top unit screen wind outdoors recording . Cool ! This small device amazing quality . The built-in mic records well compared tiny . Mic gain controls boost volume BUT add noise ( like reviews state ) used low-gain , record quite well . records even better used good microphones mixer ( I used Behringer ) AMAZINGLY clear recordings . Several types SDHC cards work well NOT found card NOT work device . Even ( ) batteries power , although alkaline ( ) last : The plastic case vulnerable scratches treat carefully . I purchased reading many favorable reviews online seemed like good unit price . After trying use I promptly returned . I sound concerts wanted recorder connect sound board record shows . I used minidisc recorder wanted something would easily computer . I tried recording H2 using 's line jack recording line tape Mackie sound board stereo receiver . No matter I set levels recording H2 distorted . I played record levels AGC limiter functions tried recording several different audio sources always got distorted signal . I used minidisc application many years never problem always got clean , good quality sound . The problem H2 gain mic line inputs appear meant mic level signal , caused line level signal overdrive preamp . Recording internal mics seems work fine . I worked professional sound equipment 25 years Zoom recorders brand I found problem.The H2 nice menu set instructions easy follow want good line level recordings , look something else . I exchanged model H4n problem recording line level signal , bad H2 . I finally ended getting Tascam DR-07 I happy . It less bells whistles appears overall better quality recorder . I also Olympus LS-10 . This gives recording ability 96/24 much less expensive . You get ability record four channels I dying try I get hands 5.1 encoding software . Also nice included brands , A tripod hold unit , handle use unit like microphone , charger , noted zoom n't speakers built . If truly want monitor quality tinny little built speakers going cut . You need monitors quality headphones . I find inner ear monitors work best noisy I said title tradeoff terms material . Olympus seem robust casing controls . This may big issue n't treat equipment carefully . Time tell , I doubt zoom unit solid product especially money.I also looking Zoom H1 come Sept. 2010 . This product may actually LS-10 killer . There many reviews little jewel , I wo n't bother going details 's everything I could hoped . The sound quality amazing 's easy use . I 'm using many things including music player truck . I take everywhere never let . I get carrying case quality versus price accessories ARE included , I complaints . awesome product works great . even lets set level recording options low high level settings.it lots cool features listed manual clearly defined use version 's awesome . A year ago , I wrote lengthy comparison theEdirol R-09 Recorder , Blackand theZoom H4 Handy Recorder + Accessory Kit ( pre-accessory kit ) . I wanted high quality , easy use recorder , even though H4 features Edirol sold considerably less , I kept Edirol much easier use.Zoom responded H2 , scaled version H4 features R-09 controls right need . The H2 even additional features R-09 , n't get way . For example , 's choice 90 degree recording pattern , 120 degree recording pattern , even surround sound option . nice video demonstrations website.One big complaint I 've Edirol cost add-on stand . Unlike Edirol , H2 comes simple stand . In addition , H2 threaded hole mounted standard digital camera tripod ! On separate note , 's much easier replace batteries H2 , I got together friends recorded live acoustic music Edirol R-09 Zoom H2 . I used Adobe Audition normalize tracks ( , equalize loudness ) . The first time played back , I thought I detected VERY slight preference Edirol , overall opinion group split two units . The second time played back , preference H2 , overall opinion continuing split . We agreed differences small negligible all.I prefer Edirol 's control buttons H2 's membrane I 'm sell Edirol , perhaps I familiar Edirol n't want give yet . Also , Edirol R-09 darling moment . However , I owned neither , I could n't justify huge bump price Edirol H2 would opt H2 . When I went music party last weekend knew I 'd need one recorder , I grabbed H2 . The main advantage recorder I get good result without knowing much.I 've made surprisingly good recordings choir concerts various venues without special knowledge , though I 'm sure knowing would make recording sound thing absolutely learn set mic gain correctly n't overpower mic . I n't use auto anything I try side low . Excellent low noise property unit means , except rare cases , I boost sound later PC result still passable purpose . I play teach classical guitar needed good digital recorder record students also able convert mp3 format upload internet . I 've recorded several solo pieces pick guitar well , including string squeaks fret buzzes ( darn ) . So , force clean playing bit . If musician want recorder portable relatively easy use , little gadget quite good . It wo n't give `` recording studio '' quality , clearly hear deep tones classical guitar hiss , background noise ( unless birds like I ) 're recording I get ready record , I set gain described manual , set recorder music stand begin playing . Since I bought card , I play piece many times I need row without worrying running memory I finally play piece specifications . Also , connect H2 electrical outlet rely batteries , one less worry . Your H2 wo n't die recording batteries give out.I ca n't really tell difference recording quality without wind sock came . It sounds . I guess I singer I would use screen wind guitar n't really need . Yes , screen small difficult read - I keep magnifying glass handy , I 've pretty much got button pushing sequences n't need use often see screen . Also , download free editing program `` Audacity '' convert recordings various 'd give 5 stars case little substantial . It seems fragile I dropped luckily bounced foot big fuzzy house shoe n't break . But might I broken 's fall . And need longer USB cord . I ca n't believe one sent short . But easy fix overall one nice little tool . And price , I 'd buy ! : - } UPDATE 'm still using H2 Zoom almost daily basis record students playing playing . I still love , works great I feel I really purchased great item . Not sure title good , anyway : I gotten much use H2 ! I 'm music teacher , I recorded music classes performing groups . Being able easily record class listen really eye ( ear- ) opening kids ! It easy use . The various recording quality settings useful , anything high quality record space-saving mp3 setting.You record stereo front unit , turn 4-way , all-around recording.I 've used mine lot also recording various instruments . I often record one part duet , play along it.You editing unit , 's easier download track use software . I gone direct disk , though , cutting little noise beginning end , editing little fault . It takes rename track , instance , could desktop I Sony minidisc recorder , right really already obsolete time I bought . I finally got tired messing discs.I glad I got H2 . I 'm raising rating , result ? Getting `` '' front page . In case , even though I recently picked Sony Amazon , I 'm sufficiently impressed Zoom H2 give 5 stars endorse anyone wants professional quality results without expense track digital recorders even fuss complicated personal recorders . For quite competition , price come , Zoom H2 stands immediate competition . Currently , H2 `` back-up '' unit . But convenience stealth purposes , I often use main recorder.Anyone receives item guaranteed impressed . values n't spared terms packaging ; included equipment ( batteries power adapter , protective pouch , handy table stand , mic stand adapter , wind screen , ear buds , USB cable , SD card ) ; manual ( quick set-up sheet plus ample booklet generous-sized print written clear , English makes Sony 's recent instruction manuals look torturous comparison ) .The screen controls , admittedly , minuscule , requiring sharp eyes ( though screen well-illuminated ) fingers ( I much prefer knobs slider switches Sony touch-pad Zoom ) . What 's encouraging recorder , apart price , designers Zoom made H2 genuine audiophile and/or all-around musician mind . It 's simply another `` guitar player 's gadget , '' loaded endless supply effects , loops , rhythm bass tracks , files within files , programs buried within programs . The H2 , unlike pricey Sony , handle .wav mp3 protocol , microphone fields ranging 90 degrees 360 degrees , capable applying compression limiting recorded files , offers wide range sensitivity placement recording lectures , , solo performers . In short , device promises deliver quality recorders costing thousand -- practical digital storage card : Although instructions quick point input external microphone ( pictured ones two popular stereo mics made Sony , costing $ 60 $ 90 respectively ) , Zoom onboard mic ( actually 4 ) darn good . It captured range resonance grand piano even managed pick conversation kitchen clock 's upstairs . And 's reassuring see mic surface area reminiscent mics past ( single tiny hole common days ) . Getting recorded signal onto computer 's included cable , edit wave pattern program like Cool Edit ( I strongly recommend editing recorder ) . There 's also metronome board ( potentially useful student musician practice sessions ) tuner ( useful student musician pro wants instrument tune recording ) drawbacks : 1 . Zoom admittedly things bit audiophile bells whistles -- , compressors , cut-off levels , AGC control , levels , sensitivity ratios , panning effects , list goes . It 's easy miss step , waste precious time fumbling menu , find fingers going numb making tiny adjustments . Moreover , instructions , clear , much information would help beginner . The audience keeps changing someone 's complete newbie someone 's knowledgeable aficionado . And I great difficulty imagining band impatient student taking time fiddle scrolling tiny screen 's menu get metronome tuner . ( Frankly , 75 kids squirming seats I 'd go old single-function , , metronome without second thought. ) 2 . The H2 light using AC adaptor seems rather highly unlikely . Undoubtedly 'll want pick 2 4 GB SD card good supply double A batteries ( takes 2 ) record field . At standard MP3 ( 128-meg ) quality , good dozens hours . ( The adaptor would made sense Zoom enabled charge batteries could remain recorder. ) 3 . My H2 would connect iMac OSX Leopard without downloading upgrade Zoom site . After difficulty install , I decided forget simply transfer files `` real time . `` What 's encouraging recorder , apart price ( 2/3 H4 , 1/2 Edirol ) designers Zoom made H2 genuine audiophile and/or all-around musician primary breaker : The tiny screen small controls . Until mastering , I would want `` back-up '' cassette recorder performance I judged special importance . As build quality , H2 like new almost 18 months use . Undoubtedly 'll want pick 2 4 GB SD card good supply double A batteries ( takes 2 ) record field . At standard MP3 ( 128-meg ) quality , good dozens hours . ( The adaptor would made sense Zoom enabled charge batteries could remain recorder . ) My H2 would connect iMac OSX Leopard without downloading upgrade Zoom site . After difficulty install , I decided forget -- especially seeing slow ( I mean really , `` overnight '' slow ) machine `` '' long file converting .wav mp3 . What takes minutes software program like Sound Studio Studio requires hours 're using Zoom computer interface . Use best -- , produce realistic audio tiny , weightless , durable device practically makes added gratuitous frankly puts shame expensive rivals . Excellent Sound quality.Very functional easy work with.Small enough take used Gear life right . I n't want anything else . If read tiny little screen , thing records nicely . But 's pain move one selection . There couple times I almost threw wall . It tendency completely on/off switch nothing . You pull batteries reinstall damn thing work . 
512	I 've played string instruments better part 55 years ... Starting cheap Wood box 5 year old , progressing Martin 6 12 string Acoustic guitars , electric Fender Gibson units ... .

I bought present daughter learn guitar . She absolutely loves . Everyone played past weeks loves . You ca n't beat price ! ! ! This fine guitar , n't amazing . My particular instrument issues finish couple places around perimeter guitar - look like black splotches underneath sunburst paint . There 's one near top strap post another near place mounts underside body . Neither would apparent someone n't guitar , n't look normal . Maybe I got first one line switched models ? My guitar also weird V shape back neck wood grain n't match - I 'm guessing 's joint glued together . I know better Les Paul guitars neck , since I n't read one something different , I assumed would . Glue stronger wood Les Paul guitars tendency break area , I guess guitar durable . Still , disappointing unexpected discovery . I 'm sure seeing finish issues would 've buying guitar , upon reflection would 've much smarter visit music store examine guitar remaining issues instrument general design Les Paul guitars versus particular instrument . The guitar small comfortably play without strap , even sitting . The top strap peg angled slightly , guitars horns angled , means investing install straplock system kind good idea Les Paul - pegs n't stay strap holes well guitars . It 's great guitar knobs switches & # 34 ; real & # 34 ; Les Paul guitars , practical standpoint rather cumbersome separate volume tone knobs pickup . The range adjustment saddles pretty small , I found impossible setup guitar coated .09 strings without additional hardware.The guitar sounds decent , looks pretty great ( although quite pretty pictured one ) , due shorter scale length tad easier play guitars . Note : shorter scale length characteristic Les Paul guitars , n't indicate less & # 34 ; full-sized & # 34 ; guitar . Though fine guitar price , I 'm sure I would make choice I position .

You bet , I add next guitar collection , another epiphone . Well done Epiphone ! ! I learning Squier six months really wanted better guitar . After research , reading reviews , checking guitar store , I chose one.It 's much easier play Squier , better sound . Like Squier ( bad ) , gets little buzzy top strings . I suspect might need adjusted , I n't clue go it.It 's also good choice women . I 'm small woman , I really like neck smaller . It 's also fairly , I 'm happy choice . A guitar tech told 's best guitar $ 500 . Maybe . I expect happy years I upgrade . I bought 3 years ago amazon I could n't happier . This first electric year owning , I got way expensive Fender Strat I still prefer Epiphone feels ; really lightweight , lot even Les Pauls distance frets smaller one guitars I tried , makes VERY easy play , stays tune looks really REALLY like much , I decided add pair Slash 's Alnico , cost guitar , made sound incredibly awesome improve sustain , good ol ' rock.Call cheap want I would n't care , one items makes wonder , come 's others way overpriced n't find way justify `` real '' Gibson Les Paul sound $ 800 - $ 1000 n't recently ( 3 years - I estimate somewhere around 1000 hours heavy use ) started fretting 's I gave 4 stars ; would expect $ 200 guitar ... ? I 'm sure easily fixed guitar tech continue sweet-tone machine always . If 're learning , looking first electric want `` practice '' axe dissapoint , go ahead buy , n't give 2nd thought . I playing guitar since I 6 years old ( 3 decades ) I must say pleasant surprise . I n't electric years , n't budget get Gibson , picked Epi Les Paul 100 instead , along Fender Mustang I Amp . Great combination . This guitar sloid feel , came set-up perfectly right box . All needed tuning . Unlike others , I n't feel strings I got needed changed right away , probably within first two weeks want change . Replaced mine Ernie Ball `` Not Even Slinky 's '' could n't happier way thing plays sounds . Great sustain , beautiful harmonics , clean tones warm , get nice blues tones , superb thrash metal . Very versatile . It quiet country jazz , n't really meant to.The action extremely easy , fret board great feel , good width neck , slinder thick . It feels good finish product nice . One thing though , pick guard kind tan / cream white color , bright white pictured , still looks , mentioned description , come 12 foot cord , 's best quality . Would recommend picking new one , well worth $ 500 list MSRP . At less half steal.If considering instrument , n't hesitate . Well , Epiphone Les Paul came earlier morning ! Am I impressed ? U bet ! This thing simply beautiful ! It arrived well padded double box . Initially , I spent minutes going whole guitar see I could spot flaws . NONE ! Not finger print anywhere !

It 's considerably I thought . I would imagine weighs . I strap ordered way.The maple top work art superior finish . All metal hardware appears top quality Duncan pickups . This Epiphone lot easier play thing I ever . Your hand floats frets ! I n't think could get better piece price point . This one awesome guitar ! I also purchased Fender Mustang I Amp , Epiphone custom case ( fits like glove ) Planet Waves Planet Lock Leather Guitar Strap ( comfortable secure ) made combination along Rocksmith 2014 .

515	I worried dropping guitar foot , floor . The strap would n't hold guitar longer . I wanted something cheap , something n't require remove buttons unscrewing , I worried damaging guitar . So I decided get strap lock , rocks works perfectly . I 've used different strap lock systems far favorite design ( mention affordable must due simplicity ) . To use , put strap guitar ( usual ) put locks . Rotate smaller piece holes line slide lock strap . Once lock passed head guitar 's strap button , rotate smaller piece holes line ( close position ) 180 degrees open position . Very simple works well.I used lock system 's perfect . Every one I 've used failed one point another ( came unexpectedly ) . These work exceptionally well . What I like design n't require modifications guitar strap . You use strap like without adding anything n't replace guitar 's existing strap stick bit ( keep strap sliding ) 're concerned looks , might want try another system 's discreet . Also , I tend use thinner leather straps thinner ends . These likely work well thicker straps tend take height strap buttons . The strap locks work ... But kind pain . They fairly large , I installed second one , pieces kept coming apart . They go back together easily , I install one piece time.The strap lock required effort install thick leather strap , I really squeeze feels safe secure . work guitars . one guitars rounded head fit anyway I tried . though arrow shaped holders works every single guitarist 's plays live even practices standing home worry & # 34 ; guitar gon na cut lose strap fall floor ? & # 34 ; well , little fellows solution , work fine , think reliable . wish made way securing mechanism stronger . mean , good price , need change guitar 's built strap buttons ... 100 % recommended ... also , read review 'bout fitting guy 's lp ... well obviously , depends strap ... use strap locks lp standard vos , fit fine ( use gibson strap ) . It 's ok product price weak small amount force pop . I 'm using Ovation Balladeer . A guitar rounded back demands use guitar strap times . My guitar strap 50 years old , 1967 , leather bit worn tendency slide strap holders guitar inopportune times.With strap , strap never comes . I leave I put guitar case , waiting I get back . I 've 2 half months , problems . The hardest part putting , really n't hard , took moment understand mechanics mechanism voila ' Bob 's uncle ! ! Recommend anyone needs keep guitar strapped ready action . They plastic wear someday , I 'll buy another pair . I 've read people using bottle caps instead . My guitar valuable I suppose , I 'm trusting expensive gitty wo n't hit floor . I mean pay quality instrument right ? Why earth would skimp keeping safe ? I 'm sorry 's action . This n't 1960 , get upgrade already . I play standing 95 % time , necessity . I separate taking hastily , except one snapped right back together . When I first started playing , I brand new ( ) guitar hit floor neck break I n't use . That 's something happen life , . The complaint I whatever happened round ones ? They bit appealing eye thing well . Low cost strap lock works Guitars buttons . It comes two package . I used one four Guitars , install smaller button one Guitar . This design works best . Love ! I purchased well Jim Dunlop 7000 locks . I recommend 7000 model . They work way made pretty much way , big clumsy . The 7000 model n't take much space . You need straps either thin ends strap enough room strap units . This true either one models . I regular nylon 2 & # 34 ; Levy strap two models ( 7000 ) work well , I prefer smaller , rounder model ( 7000 ) . They fit enough room strap button , pop right . I threw mine away . My rhythm guitar player recently dropped broke SG strap locks . I bought set . I use unless standardize need separate strap every set locks . This eliminates issue short money next guitar repair . I bought two sets , great keep strap guitar , still keep everything stock ! I even called Dunlop see lok strap systems would work electric acoustic . The guy Dunlop told `` oh yes , specifically designed work electric acoustic '' . That NOT case . I purchased multiple units , cost return Amazon 's worth . But basically I know hunks plastic I could use make sculpture ! Because bottom pin plug electric pick , thickness causes problem plastic anyone solution securing strap , please reply really I called Dunlop apparently customer service folks n't know products well enough recommending product . It 's called , people ! ! ! I read reviews Amazon kind turned buying first . Eventually I went ahead sprung since n't expensive . I needed one , expected package come one , two locks pleasant surprise . I 've 2-3 months n't failed yet . They keep strap place fine fairly sturdy plastic pieces . Really helped lot strap would keep slipping knob I use skills get guitar hit floor . The complaint I fit bit tight strap ( though could nylon strap bit thick ) EXTREMELY snug fit makes kinda nervous . However , I keep tight I still allowing rotate bit everything fine far . Not sure reviews negative , I complaints . Hard believe bad . I Planet Waves locking guitar strap , dream , thought would allow lock regular strap . However , thick ca n't really fit regular guitar strap pin strap , I tried lock , two pieces came apart . Go Planet Waves Lock Straps .

But Nady 's handle announcing , vocals , , needed , softer sounding instruments ( flute , harmonica ) , none broken quit watch.I 'm keyboardist , mic power fidelity n't affect .

It well gig bag , extra padding base instrument ( bottom strap button would one ) cushion bottom hold standing end . It also nicely padded handle . I received box items packaged well . ( Ukulele included . They cost little . ) This great padded case fits soprano uke right . I like ride bike take uke along . The small size means fits fine . The thick padding protects uke bumps scrapes . The larger cases nice offer robust protection n't fit shopping bag backpack nearly well . Highly recommended uke player . I one Lanikai tenor , one Stagg soprano . The soprano one fits great , even though 's different brand . Perfect . This bag nicer I expected price . Considering many soprano ukuleles $ 20 t0 $ 100 range , lot people wo n't want buy hard case three times price gig bag money instrument case better padded I might expected price . Since soprano ukuleles small lightweight instruments , 's clear hard case would important people might somebody evaluating guitar cases , cases larger small child likely sit instrument drop stairs constantly , might want consider something better . But provide adequate protection general , even minor falls . For soft bag , offers I would ever need .

529	In October 2009 I ordered custom Strat Bass Custom Strat came strings . I recommend going . The bullet style makes easier install . You know I mean professional . For Fender guitar bullets best choice tone longevity strings . They seat snug enhances sustain . Quality found behind Fender name . These original bullets great Strat . They made specifically Fender tremolo bridge fit perfect . The strings sound great hold & # 34 ; whammy & # 34 ; fine . Sound great look great . No string expert work great , stay tune like I ca n't even believe , actually thought someone tuning guitar stays tune long . Fender Accessories Pure Nickel Electric Guitar Strings , Custom good ! I got Strat guitar sound much better Ernie Ball D'Addario ( least taste ) . These strings nickel greatly reduces fret saddle wear sound good . If using stainless steel strings wearing two critical guitar components eventually replaced . easy replace fret wire costly type work best left experts comes added cost player.\So I ( many others ) play end ? If playing Stratocaster tremolo bridge bullets designed fit string receivers trem block effect add mass tremolo block adds transfer tone guitar whole.Those two beneficial features alone convinced give honest try time ( I 've using years ) proven optimal string durable . Do last ? Well , yes . I rotate guitars gigs I would say I using strat exclusively playing much I week - I end changing every 2 3 weeks I 'm playing 4 nights per week including rehearsal noodling around I put rigorous workout.What would hours ?

It works well . wish would bought 4 20 buy sure great guitar cables use cable patch preamp amp . works really well . two different style ends gives good options putting system together . Not much say cable . It worked box ... shorts noises . The jacket straight plug partly unscrewed 's continuing problem cords . I use thread-lock . I find right angle plugs useful lots things . I use 5 footer guitar pedals amp . I move around plug unplug often two months daily use works well brand new . I initially concerned I first received cable would last .

But I buy another I still still 's original packaging back cords . Until break use hard 6 months I nothing else say . Construction Use : connectors shielding cables good introduce much noise system.The manufacturer done good job cable , user responsible two things ( addresses complaints I see reviews ) :1 ) Take care cables . The right angle plug side much stronger straight plug side ; design . Take good care cables last quite long time . This includes taking time store use.2 ) Make sure know length need cable . The shorter cable , better studio use . It reduces signal travel time potential interference ( though cables shielded latter concern moot ) . If need longer cable , buy longer cable . Do n't buy advertised 5 ' cable write negative review really needed 15 ' cable . Bought two shockingly low price I could n't beat even double price . Quality cable , sturdy user serviceable connectors , well constructed , 6 months daily use issues . What ask ? I bought cable , guitar connection back . This Just fix perfectly !

It short , works small amp I purchased . I done These good quality cables economical price . The difference Hosa , high end cables barely noticeable . The cable shipped fast , I could n't pleased . Unless 're going get expensive professional chord good works great medium sized venues . In fact , I n't think Hosa cord lasted 2 hours . One step cord came apart . This purchase reason I 'm looking buy wireless system . Maybe 're using run PA I would recommend . But performer hard cords I would n't recommend item ... .but fair , I would recommend wireless performer . You 'll end saving money long haul . This little cable gets used practice amp . I love 90 degree connection . The overall quality seems good I problems . Let upfront . I often use electric guitar unplugged . When I plugged , I n't move around lot . So cord get good frequent use abusing . But hum noise seems solid . It affordable . Ca n't say would perform used live performance time , price , I complain . I suspect always work good due light usage . One guitar heavy duty work great . I probably n't need 15 ' length , time , really good cable angles . I got I adding Pedal practice amp . This runs Guitar pedal . Works perfect length right reach guitar pedal . This actually best cable I think I soon upgrading cheaper cables This great adding pedals . You cant go wrong item price even thank using month 2 now.. absolutely problems..good , looks end good good .

541	As condenser 's definitely light weight , $ 100 bucks sounds pretty good ... Used acoustic guitar less satisfatory results , got great sound violin fairly decent voice sound.Looking forward tests . given budget cheap microphones , odds cant afford make mistake buying one . I like fact adds deeper , bassier tone voice 's missing clarity . If want low tone also treasure clarity , spend 30 dollars less get MXL 990 instead . even comes shockmount carrying case . I hooked 990 cheap ART Tube MP preamp letting vocalists experiment , agreed 990 clearly superior V67G hooked much expensive preamp . Some vocalists actually prefer MXL 990 couple Shure condenser microphones . bought modest step vocal tracks home recording 24 bit using mxl990 . mic would great price wasnt defective . used 30 minutes crackling static started . go back 990 thereturn warranty taken care . still recommend mic though . hotter highs , good compression , power amp eq result well worth money . This mic really nice . I used many recordings still amazes sound great . Works great voice overs , singers , rappers.That said , wo n't outperform mics would encounter studios today , little tweaking , right preamp , mic sound one review mentioned n't female vocalists . I 've used one sounded great , good one I used studio , worked pinch overdubbing studio time available . I studio engineer , I professional musician . I record songs home hobby . I like reasonably nice gear order get good sound possible setting , 're around level , know I 'm talking . Will compare mic costs three times much ? No . Are likely find high-end professional studio ? Eh ... probably . Is pretty sweet deal price point ? yes.I 've worked way terms mic quality hobby gotten progressively serious , nicest mic I right . The difference quality even nice dynamic mic immediately obvious . I use recording vocals , voice ( , pro ! ) finicky record , usually sounding pretty muddy . Even nicer dynamic mics usually used vocals ( SM57 58 ) still case . But mic , voice sounds much clear , subjective evaluation , n't mic subjective ? You go day response range EQ flatness , matters end mic sounds application . And ears , mic sounds wonderful.My real gripe sensitivity pattern n't seem super-tight cardioid , still picks sound coming behind . Perhaps 's supposed , trying record vocals loud electric guitar simultaneously , headache trying isolation method works . I took star alone , although may fair since I n't used condensers therefore idea 're supposed behave way . use record music , works great vocals instrument together separate . I like deep tones wide range pick . grabs everything need careful background , get even thinking , dont forget phantom power needed ! Really nice mic . I lot research purchasing home studio . I record acoustic guitar vocals mic sound wonderful . Plenty low end still capturing clear mids highs . Makes voice sound fantastic . I read lot reviews saying mic right voice works wonders , certainly shot 're budget like ! Really remarkable microphone around $ 100 . Very sensitive . . . studio , live performances . Be sure set DAW insert input channel compressor/limiter , easily blow volume clipping . Has rich warm tone , like tube mics . Audio Tech 2020 , class say Audio Tech . Ca n't beat price . This mic fantastic ! I 've singing , writing , recording almost 30 years mic pretty much good silly expensive German mics I 've used larger studios years . There 's slight presence peak , nothing like Chinese mics . It n't shrilling peaky . Male tenor vocals acoustic guitar sound great without need EQ whatsoever beyond hi pass filter sub stuff . This mic also excellent candidate Michael Joly mod , calls one 7 audio wonders world makes sense mic good $ 200 . Michael mods mics 'd hard pressed able tell difference one famous U87 German name starts `` N '' . I 'm using totally stock 's great . Buy . I 'm pretty new using mics PA systems used dynamic mics past , recreationally . This condenser mic way larger heavier dynamic mic , I surprised I took box . It good looking person pictures . Three things benefit : 1 . ) I learned condenser mics susceptible moisture purchase windscreen 're going use vocals , since moisture singing mic damage . 2 . ) This cardioid pickup pattern ; n't sing directly end mic like dynamic mic . This stand straight mic stand , paying attention way mic facing since lot attenuation one side . 3 . ) It requires phantom power . You need PA provides 48V power use it.When I first used mic , I tried singing end could n't hear well . Later evening I standing side could hear loud I back away foot mic . Then I remembered reading cardioid pattern stood straight mic stand , paying attention orientation mic . It sensitive I really stay backed mic easy two three people stand around vocals . I acoustic electric guitar I playing , able turn amp completely mic picked instrument vocals clearly . Other musicians impressed well . I payed $ 100 , I think great value product . 
542	It works really well 's really thin . It 's thinner thought . The price 's right . I needed 3 since buy one time expensive buy box got . These really great bang buck , however , like many people said , work well pedals , round ends n't fit everything.I mean cables.. compact heads allow pedals loaded onto overpriced pedal board . quality good . I like easy take apart modify put together . handy making right . I buy sure . Hosa , good cables . I use guitar effects pedals 5 footer effects amp . Had two months work great . Defiantly space saver . I put effects side side ad hook em patch cables . It 's convenient angled like , low profile fits . My complaint easily fall socket much . These good quality spite reasonable price . I love flat , low profile , right angle plugs . My complaint I needed varying lengths ( like 15 & # 34 ; ) I order Planet waves kit make finish pedalboard . I 've never problem patch cables . I 'm running 6 pedals issues like crackling cutting thing important note I 'm hard gear . I 'm home , I ca n't say patches take road/stage abuse lots setup/tear-down cycles . They seem pretty buff capable , I report I 've experienced . These sturdy , right length , design means save space effects pedals , enough length flexibility arrange semicircle , like , lot pedals . 12 mine broke within year jacks got bent pretty easily . I switched back plastic ones lasted 2 yearsHosa CFS606 6 Inch Right Angle FX Pedal Cable , 6 still going strong . I use patch cables pedal board save valuable space . They work well I n't problems shorting making static noises . I highly recommend . Plus , look nice , unlike various colors come bulkier , cheaper 1 ' cords . These thin . They allow getting pedals close , let pedal board space . I cables pedal boards . I replaced everything . Going I using , I fit 2 pedals pedalboard , mission accomplished ! I love patch cables . They serviced need , mine never needed . I 've ordered 3 guys I would order instance already excessive pedalboard become complex . The length cable presents limitations expected , bulb ends may issue tight squeezes . However many cables much lesser value , unserviceable event breakdown . Simple . Solid . Compact . Convenient . Audio quality unchanged name metal patch cables . For money , ca n't beat six pack open extra space board clean bit . Once setup pedalboard ... 's , n't going move , stretch , step cables ... fact lighter weight really issue . They however allow make use space yourpedalboard ... packing pedals side side without staggering like larger heavier cables require . Just aware ends big vertical input boxes , like Danelectro Fish Chips , ca n't used cables input output close together . I 've almost 3 years now.. single problem ! I 've changed setup like crazy , sometimes even cables twisted certain position pedalboard . Been bent edge cable right connector , pulled ( normal way ) stomped , never single cut offs n't worry much cables like sissy bedroom princess guitarists , 're using od/distortion pedals anyway right ? If 're purist , n't ever use pedals even electric guitar . Good luck ! They good ends , feel little flimsy cord side things . They good signal though n't seem alter tone . I pedalboard time tell hold . 
543	This polish recommended one Dan 's books works great . It really makes natural high gloss finish acoustic guitars pop . The effect n't noticeable darker finishes though . It really helps back neck , makes slippery fast . Highly recommended . I got clean Washburn acoustic guitar , worked great . I used clean fingerprints grime , would buff circular motion soft , lint-free rag , would act like polish . The finish sparkled afterwards , even light . Great product . Ive using polish since early 80 's . It n't smell way works fantastic guitars . Wonderful polish hurt guitars . What hurt guitars dropping sweating , polish ? No way . Martin knows 're . I use expensive nitrocellulose finishes . Used , enough . Had using Gibson Polish , although worked fine , could n't force use Martin Model Guitar . This product excellent . Cleaning thorough leaves residue . Made little Martin look almost good new . one everyone told I use , new guitar I figured one polish ( car ) work well , incorrect part , delicate woods preserves far better ordinary polishes I bought son clean guitar . He really likes lot . It works well use microfiber cloth . I would buy product ! 
544	I bought replace Behringer UCA202 . The Behringer performs well use ( guitar home studio ) , recently 's become way sensitive interference ; I getting noise nearby cable modem / router / network drives . This noise making way recordings : - ( For ended less twice price Behringer I decided try unit . Not , much warmer , intimate sound.It 's USB powered , installs automatically minute Win7 issues . I go Lexicon website get driver , though , safe side.REAPER new entries device audio settings panel ( ASIO ! : - ) ) . Everything works great , first time . I even able remove little mixer entire setup thanks zero-latency monitoring device : - ) Great unit . I love Behringer , thing kicks tail . The hardware works advertised easy operate . Make sure good microphone use . The Cubase software also works well user interface instructions complex might wish . That seems common problem music recording programs I 've seen - heavy reliance technical jargon may unfamiliar typical amateur singer/guitarist . This come good & # 34 ; & # 34 ; course helps user learn jargon common applications . The Alpha great little interface . It accepts 2 inputs 2 outputs going computer . It 's powered via USB . The & # 34 ; mix & # 34 ; knob nice feature , allowing hear input less prominently within playback mix without affecting input DAW . I 'm using cakewalk 's Music Creator 6 Touch I n't bother load LE software came . I like cakewalk 's software better anyways ( preference ) . Some reviewers commented hearing hiss unit recording . I n't problem . It extremely silent save noise I would generate anyway rig . All I feel great product definitely worth money . This solid performing unit price point . I 've using alongside laptop long I remember works day I bought . The two line instrument microphone inputs make perfect beginner anyone needing budget interface works easy use.My negative criticism would plastic feels little cheap . But still great USB interface anyone absolutely spend $ 60 . I using record garage band 's demo get us gigs . I gigging musician 20 years . Had days half hour opening , I two guitar tracks , bass track , drums tracks ( garageband ) laid . Easy plug , I using garageband . Very quality recordings far . Like Put vocals cheap shure mic ( ) used fx garageband got nice vocal track , easy layer harmonies . Still yet mic drum kit ... Still enjoying product , still amazed ease use . Did try install software PC Vista , - Mic 'd drum kit mixer , lined interface , I mixed drum mics mixer . You record drums single track 're recorded mix individually ( ie . snare , kick ) . I get quality recordings set way . I sure recording engineer could give better ideas get , , I pleased . I bought work 9 year old son . This many cool things , although I ready turn loose yet . I difficulty finding code included software . I using Audacity free download . I would pay price . 
545	started useing 3 yrs ago worth long performance takes alot pressure shoulderif never used one befor try like I many heavy guitars . Yet wide guitar straps old men blues posers . I 'm neither . However , back still hurting , I 'm definitely weakling . So I bought shoulder pad . Now I look like weakling people see play guitar . Thanks Planet Waves ! Really , though , 's quite good . The padding comfortable slightly heavy , Velcro flaps make installation easy . The thing I like prone slide around nylon strap . I probably use double sided tape attach strap , I feel ave designed inner flap something less slippery . I 'm big fan Planet Waves ruined Strap , good product - definitely helps alleviate weight shoulder . My hopes pad would soft sqishy shoulder . The gel pretty dense , 's kind hard squishy heavy ! I found added weight . I 'm using . I would look elswhere different product . This strap comfortable ! Love velcros right strap without remove guitar . It slide around adjusted every time I put worth final result . Very big , cushioned . I n't notice helped much weight bass , helped little . Almost thought little cumbersome , kind bit neck little . This strap cool , black , made nice material gel padding , Velcros open closed take guitar strap without undoing strap person guitar . Like clasp wraps around strap Velcros . Where I noticed pressure nylon strap , I feel nothing heavy pad puts pressure whatsoever . Adds 2 lbs weight guitar . Get strap n't feeling good , brands work thread strap suckssss . This one legit . To heavy ... .it n't stay need . slips becuase wieght.. get something else larger strap wieght guitar ... 
546	It would improper claim Stratocasters , I Stratocaster remake I drilled new holes Stratocaster pickguard get screws . What I say packaging nice n't seem cheapo ( surprised n't come scattered envelope ziplock bag ) size screws right , dark chrome finish screws pretty slick , came enough install Stratocaster pickguard . I 'm sure screws right length fit authentic Stratocasters anyways . These screws shiny chrome , worked perfectly pearl pickguard black Fender Strat body . They good quality screws . I replaced old tarnished screws . They fit great plenty screws . I going replace old screws . Fender guitars made tinkering -- basically lumber assembled wood screws .

I bought I constantly loosing screws I change pickguards new exactly doctor ordered . Original equipment 're right screws , A must every guitarist , matter brand work well made n't strip screwing first time . If 's new project , always drill pilot holes anyway . I glad I bought , one one used ... almost time order another set.I store little sandwich bag . 5 stars They slightly nickel finish chrome look way better , give u spares . Fender pickguard screws excellent , work well project may moment , I replaced squier standard screws strat 're much better ones get squier guitars made better small screw face keep axe looking excellent Pretty disappointed color .

Other two missing screws , hardware great replacement missing oxidized hardware Stratocaster . They work issues handy hand . Dont know else say screws fasten thongs place Old screws rust , often presented new pick guard 11 instead 8 holes attachment . This package neatly solved necessary matching finish guitar . Also good lost attachment screws back guitar tuning mechanisms . I guess screws , seem good quality . Worth little extra Fender quality I suppose . What I say srews held pickgaurd place . fit factory hole without problem . nothing fancy work . What I say ? Fits perfectly pickguard Fender style guitar . You could probably find cheap hardware store , I lazy go looking . Normal pickguard screws , nothing special . You get nice amount money , though , still good , great , deal . Good buy stocking , n't expect anything special Fender name . Pickguard screws . The screws tough gentle screwdriver n't bugger heads . They high enough quality put taken couple times become worn . These screws fit project guitar perfectly considering older Epiphone Gibson I opted add pick guard , screws fit everything perfectly . The look screws even better cheap one find import low end made guitars fat heads strip really easy . I purchase next build . Replacing pickguard ? screw ? replacement screws need . I ordered new pickguard Strat case I lost one screws . Exactly like stock screws . They look right size fit cover well , must want right screw job thanks build customer , without , would real problem . Also used tremolo back cover . Very handy . And digging parts bin screws .

551	The Dunlop Guitar Fingerboard Kit arrived quickly put test immediately . I pleased product . It makes guitar look new . I definitly look products . Thanks Amazon quick service . I n't quite sure expect old guitars pretty weathered looking fingerboards . I figured I 'd give try . I glad I . I could believe much residue rag I cleaned fret board , yuk . Then I used 02 treatment product treat really brought natural color . I 'd like say looks like new , guitar 1967 would stretch.But looks heck lot better , almost new . I used one less valuable acoustics , 's still USA made Fender . I faith I 'm going Gibson acoustic I couple electrics I I change strings . This stuff great . Nice little kit . 800 grit sandpaper , I n't noticed listing , maybe I overlooked . I bought 600 grit used neck used guitar neglected nearly decade . The 600 made glassy smooth ( wet sanding ) - I used instead 800 came package worked well me.I made mistake waxing fretboard carnuba wax reading chat board . Big mistake deadened sound terrible .

I put new strings using man ! Felt like day arrived factory . Can slide play much smoother . speed improvement . I bought new guitar wanted keep great shape . I guess kit works okay , 's hard use . It probably last entire lifetime . I think smaller kit would better . You really need remove strings use , take strings . I usually replace one string time I changing strings , I change habits . If guitar without truss rod , may mean take lot time tuning 're done changing strings , since neck bend tighten strings one time , change pitch strings already tuned . I 'm expert , I gut feeling money well spent . However , since I love guitar , I use anyway . I cleaned oiled fretboard straocaster day I received product . The cleaning product worked nicely oil hard get applicator . The fretboard turned nicely though I decided give 4 instead 3 . I say though I believe big bottle eye glass cleaner clean fretboard good furniture polish would work well . Since use small amount kit last long time n't bad buy . Just remember n't recommended maple fretboard could damage . If want use type product I recommend one . Has everything need keep fretboard well , Seems hold well also ( treatment lasts awhile ... ) cloth polishing frets nice , worth $ 20.00 , sure ... .. 
552	While I wish bases came different colors , I really like hangars . They look good , perform well .

The opening wide enough accommodate classical guitar 12-string guitars wide support 5-string banjo . ( I 've submitted photo showing holding classical & 12-string guitars , 5-string banjo ) .

557	I research new guitar rig I kept seeing amp mentioned . Almost reviews I read positive . I decided order home practice amp I n't want dig main rig.The build quality solid - feels like much expensive amp . Many amps price range seem cheap poorly constructed . I really impressed packaging , documentation build amp . This first Fender amp probably sound quality amazing . Being heavier rock/metal player , I would never chosen Fender amp even home practice . The first channel wonderful clean tone second channel several modeled amps . The tone ranges clean jazz high gain . There even acoustic model , sounds pretty good . There ton Youtube videos people sounds amp I wo n't go much this.The included effects simple pretty cool well , switched via optional foot switch.Overall I 'd say great amp price , like many others , I highly recommend . I start saying NOT Class 1 Tube amp ; meaning ALL tube pre-ampAND amplifier sections . I also say find one used - buy . It practice amp also serve well studio amp small gig amp . amp 2 years ago love it.The Super Champ XD considered 'hybrid ' amp . It uses solid state circuits tubesto bring hybrid 15 watts sound . The power amp tube preampis solid state tube . I real technical come amps tell youthis amp lot fans mainly hybrid . definitely plenty opinions web.This amp two channels ; one clean Classic ' tone channel one uses digital signal processing dial 16 effects 16 different amplifier voices.You purchase foot switch $ 25 enable switch channel two.The amp also 1/4 '' Speaker Out connect external speaker box youso choose increase decibels bigger speaker . There also 1/4 '' Line connect recording sound reinforcement equipment . Unfortunately , Output Effects amplifier use three tubes : 12AX7 2x . It 's speaker 10 inch , Design ' Fender . If want get louder , fuller cleaner could replacethe stock speaker Eminence Cajun ' . You also break stockspeaker see think . Some players comfortable stock speaker.With regard tubes speakers plenty forums talk themods use subsequent results mods . This amp years plenty people that.I say clean channel nice whether I play Gibsons myFender Tele . I much enjoy clean Blackface sound amp . It dial 4 5 Digital Processor ( DSP ) , I read experienced players , darn close original . like , Tweed , British ( Think Vox jangle ) , Rod , Metal , Acoustic clean ' tone optimized finger picking . There clean Jazz tone Fender Jazz King amplifier ' . Again , I amnot experienced tones many players positivecomments digital voices.With regard Effects ( Vibratone , Delay , Reverb , Chorus , Tremolo ) serviceable authentic . It often recommended pedal specific effect looking want want need highly versatile voice channel wonderful clean channel thisis amp . It weighs 25 pounds ( ) 's portability good . This wonderful deal $ 300 I originally bought 2011 . It still good - find one used . That 's brag illustrate experience . Everything imagine . This AMP ranks best . I 'm surprised I 've hated ( passion ) every DSP solid state amp I 've ever played . This hybrid incredible . The effects excellent . The built compression amazing amp works excellent recording . It many onboard effects I racks pedals , I n't use recording.It 's band amp unless 're acoustic band drummer electronic drums . It 's 15 Watts , 's loud ... 's quite loud enough get cleans drums , though might fine overdrive -- depending venue situation.It 's going emulate certain amps like VOX well , excellent Fender Black face ( excluding tube reverb ) . It Bassman ok , n't quite capture chime tone original '59 Bassman . Does n't cost $ dollars . It Marshall pretty well . Marshall 's based '59 Bassman without delicate touch , 's wonder . The acoustic gives clean sound makes clean sound full , yet n't sound like filter . 0 , 6 , 7 , 9 12 amazing voices . You bypass use without effects voicing sounds lot like original Super also 2x12 Vintage 30 box I connect even wonderful fully dynamic full rich sound . When I 'm playing around house need quick recording n't wan na dial sounds Vox AC30 Fender Deluxe Reverb amp choice . It miles ahead Fender Blues , indeed best amp find price versatile amp I 've played outside $ 2000 mesa . In fact , buy two . This future classic . If looking really authentic vintage tones tube warmth , fantastic amp you.Fender done amazing job AMP , : All benefits tubes , warmth dynamic levels , well lot touch sensitivity playing.The CHAMP Circuit . Forget fact Digital amp models built , also 15w Champ tube amp 10 inch speaker . It 's exactly '57 champ reissue , circuit character spanky tone Champ . ( People like great Champ tone , would pay $ 299 great 15w Champ amp . ) Add , 16 Digital Presets . Fender gives Digital models Tube Circuit Tweed Amps , Blackface Amps , Hot Rod Amps , well Metal Amps , A Jazz amp Acoustic sounding preset digital effects including Reverb , Delay , Vibe , Trem Chorus . ( Each one several choices well knob increase decrease presence effect . ) Everyone reviews amp raves authentic interesting Digital ... absolutely right.But amp breaks new ground simple fact switch directly playing song Tweed Hot Rod tone directly authentic Champ amp . Not model Champ Amp , real deal ! The amp really huge . I 'd love see Fender thing Pro Jr. even Blues Jr. Amp . Perhaps might go direction future depending success amp . knows . But I know amp simply Digital , highlights Tweed , Blackface Hot Rod tones . I really feel like channel 10 sounds like clean blues jr coming 10 inch speaker . The tweed tones syruppy awesome . The Blackface clean sounds like Princeton , I even think trying emulate Deluxe Reverb channel Far Volume ... People ask , loud enough gig ? Sure . It get loud enough drums etc . But , I 'd mic anyway . I get best overdriven tones midrange volume . Mic play Only downsides ... As much Fender tries throw bone metal heads , amp really n't give Metalheads much work . It would great practice amp guitarist , Blues , Metal , Jazz Country ... But Metal tones going big rectified would want want chug metallica riffs.Lack Mid Control . I 'm sure I understand 'd EQ Treble Bass Mid control . Personally , 's EQ knob I would use , switching Digital Presets work Treble Bass find sweet spot mids . To ears , 's spot presets . That one knob would make amp lot quicker easier use someone like likes bounce presets.This amp cool unique . Which first digital modeling amp still worth something Fender releases next big new thing . Line 6 Vox tube/digital combos really fallen quite flat resale value next generation comes . Fender found sweet spot value , quality usability . This going rare technological achievement people still hang happy 10 years unique versatile creation . Well I love da Fender products , always always . I recently built nice custom strat , testing various mini-tube amps market lately , ( I would amp ) even though better tubes watts . These comparison testing amps , ( I 2 amps also tried number others music store road ) : Blackheart Killer Ant ( 12 '' Blackheart cabinet ) Vox 8 '' Compact Practice Amp Celestion Speaker ( also speakered 12 '' Blackheart cabinet ) I 've also tested amps various ways re-tubing number collected tubes : Groove Tubes ( gold ) straight box , thing beat sound quality , even lot people calling cheap Fender speaker version . I also plugged `` The Champ '' 12 '' Blackheart speaker cabinet sounded even better using strat ( I speaker testing later ) . Fender amps always leaned sounding better fender guitars , Gibson , Epiphone , type guitars really sound pretty good Vox Blackheart amp came , way overpriced always price reasonable range . I mean price mini-tube amps minimal comparison nicer ones , thing loaded better guts , maybe screams better ... . ya-hoo , likey ! Better guts , better performance , plus Fender added extra range effects amp sounds . Its small size , light weight , loud easy carry jam sessions . 
558	I tone freak . I bought pedal back impression would sound equal big muff . At time never owned big muff . I thought sound produced big muff sound . I later took friends house matched settings real big muff . The difference huge . The big muff sounded fuller little one sounded like took sound trapped little box . I later bought big muff one go pedals least three years gigging . I currently loving still curious nano big muff looking clear space board probably use sounds anything less real deal . I would use little big muff concerns sound shined need minimize board space Consider distortion sound Cream , Doors , top . That buzzy , psychedelic type sound pedal . Unfortunately , 's . However , want perfect `` break '' guitar intro sound , absolutely pedal . Quality-wise 's awesome , I needed sound I would definitely one . I got rid mine purchase gear served wider variety functions , honestly I n't missed , I 'm Doors cover band anything . If 're familiar EHX 's signature pedal Big Muff , please go guitar shop somewhere try one . sound words helps , n't really justice . It definitely owns sonic territory playing one 'll see many guitarists many fields one 're one favorite effects , honestly . So review , I 'm going focus Little Big Muff stacks starters , version takes care ALL common complaints regarding NYC reissue.1 . Its true . Its much smaller ( super tiny like Boss , little slimmer , say , wider MXR pedals like Phase 100 ) .3 . It uses normal 9v adapter jack ( thank , finally ! ) . It sounds , indeed SOUNDS better NY Reissue . Some complained buzzy sound recent reissue . This one smoother . Not creamy Russians , also n't suck tone like one either . Its touch higher gain Russians Tone Wicker versions , absolutely Big 're market one , n't want options Tone Wicker Muff provides , absolutely . Its better every way NY , costs less money ! Yay ! This well built , high quality product . It provides great sustain distortion . If 're budget , still want professional sound ; product 're looking . The Little Big Muff one thing spectacularly well : delivers massive . For purpose , 's excellent , sound construction ( feels like metal brick ) . However , warned : 're looking standard `` distortion pedal , '' . It 's fuzz pedal . It delivers fuzz general purpose distortion pedal ( like , say , BOSS DS-1 ) . If great fuzz pedal want , superb choice -- , far I know , best one price . If price still much , consider ModTone , good substantially cheaper ( least I write ) . I several Electro-Harmonix pedals overall I like brand ( even though owner appears sexist pig clown boy many YouTube videos ) . Of I , two smaller versions GIGANTOR classic E-H pedals , one Little Big , idea difference fuzz , overdrive , distortion look buy anything . These effects used different musical styles produce different sounds , choice depend exactly plan . Do research looking YouTube , looking Dave 's book effects , testing store.If looking basic fuzz box , Little Big Muff give nice sound similar ( ) Big Muff Pi , depending exact year/model . I think tone great , basic fuzz boxes , many different sounds get . It simple use though , makes lot bonus , n't take lot pedalboard space compared Big Muff Pi , yet give tone . It great punk , alt rock/grunge , classic hard rock like Hendrix Black also ( red ) Dunlop Fuzz Face Mini , another good small version one classics , Fuzz Face mini gives low end emphasis three ( blue silicon aqua Hendrix models boost treble ) . To quickly compare Little Big Muff regarding sound , Fuzz Face tone control , I think gives better control fuzz saturation . While Little Big Muff give control tone ( EQ ) , like many EHX pedals goes zero crazy rather quickly . In case begin turning Sustain , long fuzz saturated zone . As increase amount saturation , get sustain less control dynamics pick attacks begin sound . So , I 'd say red Dunlop Fuzz Face Mini & Little Big Muff good tools , comes E-H units come power supply , one need get one unless like changing batteries . Although pedals come power supplies , I think lame include need factor cost unit.If looking pretty pedals board , might able find prettier fuzz box stark Little Big Muff . I like pretty things , sound unit good pass great tool line : ( 1 ) Gives classic Big Muff fuzz sound ( 2 ) Does eat pedalboard space like old GIGANTOR models ( 3 ) Noisy ( always good way ) , true bypass ( 4 ) Has tone control ( EQ ) , `` Sustain '' saturates quickly get less fuzz control ( limits dynamic control picking ) ( 4 ) Simple use , limited sound palette ( 5 ) Decent price , power supply sold separately ( 6 ) appearance ( shiny , colorful , sparkly ) 
559	I purchased mic use screencasts ( recording 's happening PC 's screen I talk ) . I set sit desktop , approximately 2 ' away usedCamtasia Studio 8 [ ] free program called CamStudio test . Both programs worked well mic I 'd hoped would - eliminated need clunky , wired mic build quality mic seems excellent , compact design fantastic ! I love comes carrying case desktop clipped laptop 's IN MY : included software : Cakewalk 's Music Creator LE installed one computer . You get 30 days register . I installed registered immediately , would allow put registration code , saying I n't system . I , Windows 7 PC says I , alas , would n't work . This software optional , I decided install prior microphone ( per instructions ) try . Eventually I ended uninstalling installing Cakewalk , I PC issue : muffled audio recording . No amount system tweaking seemed fix . I stumped.Then I decided go Samson site see updated drivers mic . The generic ones installed 2010 . No began reading online audio ' Windows 7 PCs . I noticed name I recognized : RealTek , name associated speakers PC ( RealTek digital audio ) . I went RealTek site noted updated drivers Windows 7 64-bit ( 2012 ) , decided download install . I rebooted PC tested audio recording . Much delight , solved muffled audio problem ! I set highest level best sound quality recording . Afterwards I tested mic using CamStudio , worked beautifully Samson Go Mic ! On desk distance 2.5 ' , mic pics voice perfectly dictation screencasts . No hiss , hum , breath noises distortion . Very clear properly installed drivers audio - works perfectly USB 2.0 connection powered USB : BUY IT FOR GREAT mic truly great 's recognized properly configured system . clear recordings , unlike I 've able obtain using USB Multimedia mic Cinema HD - price , I n't think better . It 's compact , great voice pick-up audio recording clarity . Installation issues may occur , updating audio drivers , using powered USB hub connection tweaking audio settings within operating system give quality 've hoping price 's right.UPDATE : using mic consistently couple months I 'm liking . It 's condenser mic , n't filter ambient noise well I 'd like , however forty dollar purchase - I 'm still happy . Cakewalk never registered correctly system I uninstalled . I guess anything , 's downside purchase . I surprised I tested microphone . It probably best bang buck price range . The base heavy enough allow microphone stand upright . However clip open wide enough clamp onto thicker monitors . That expected though . For 30 bucks mic great ! I garage band needed mic voice room recording , well mic . The different modes distinct perfect podcast vocals room jams . It comes long cable , rotating bad , nice carry case fits pocket . BUY mic , , surprised I purchased one 6 months ago partner musician recording equipment house . We n't really expect much except quick way record 's simple , easy use outstanding quality sound . We 've used record acoustic guitar vocals surprisingly good fidelity . We 've recorded whole ensemble practice sessions mic 's really designed still reasonable results . Our friends musicians ( even audio engineer ) quite surprised impressed quality sound 've even ordered second mic computer use skype.To sum , mic cheap , easy use , portable fidelity surprise n't expect full home recording studio : ) The mic exactly I wanted . The mic headphone jack . Having headphone jack essential making quality recordings . Also , I like two polar patterns , switchable cardioid back bit proximity mic , voice powerful . Once , I got hang I problems.I find bundled Cakewalk software useless . Please refer review '' Cakewalk Music Creator 6 '' amazon.com . It works great new `` Mixcraft 5 Audio MIDI Music Recording Software V 5 . `` Overall , awesome product . My first reaction opening box came & # 34 ; , 's lot smaller I & # 34 ; It looks like CAD 's fraction size . I 'd even say cute . But perform ? I two microphones I use recording computer : A Blue Yeti USB electret mic , . Of two , Yeti closer design , uses electret capsule built-in USB interface , like Go Mic , 's I compared . I fired Garage Band plugged microphones computer ( four year old iMac ) I could lay parallel instrumental tracks acoustic guitar , ukulele , double bat I impressed Go Mic 's lack latency ; good maybe better . There delay . No need find special driver , either . Plug 's ready go . There 's even headphone jack something unusual package tiny . Sound good , , though perhaps uncolored Yeti . I tried three modes : Carodid , Carodid + pad , Omni . Omni gave best , clearest sound , unexpectedly , hard get good level close miking . No matter I backed volume Garage Band I got clipping . Using pad I able get acceptable levels feet away . Best sound instruments obtained feet using Omni one advantage Yeti : It 's modest current requirements , I run directly iPad . The two together make nice portable recording/production combination . well thought , . The mic permanently attached via swivel strong clip also serves desktop stand , use mic folds clamp protection . And 's enough , 's separate case keep dust dirt Go Mic would n't first choice recording music , would acceptable one recording musical ideas go , perfectly acceptable voice recording , podcasting , . This mic works great recording vocals Mac using Garage Band . I also wanted use 360 play Guitar Hero Rock Band , 's recognized either game mic . That surprising since 's USB mic . It tiny mic ; 'll fit completely palm , record loud noises clearly . It also sensitive set room recording . Excellent product . Having misplaced Blue Snowflake USB mic , I decided give recently introduced , priced USB mic Samson try . ( Samson maker highly popular effective Zoom personal digital recorders -- H2 H4n . ) It 's attractive , fully piece equipment , handsome packaging ( small black box zippered carrying case aesthetics apparently inspired iPod ) . It 's smaller lighter Snowflake -- diminutive picture would suggest . Yet audio quality strikes somewhat warmer richer , favoring bass frequencies spoken narration Snowflake , slightly cleaner clearer definition treble end.The Samson Go seen instantly iMac , recording advertised : `` Plug n ' Play . '' The mic somewhat sophisticated Snowflake terms `` latency '' settings ( permits direct monitoring via headphones connected mic insure delay , lag time , transmission reception ) , 's three-way switch directional patterns ( manual could clearer , however , difference `` cardioid '' `` cardioid 10 pad . '' ) No matter . The mic performed virtually flawlessly right box , tampering switch.It 's extremely sensitive , slightly Snowflake . Yet I unable avoid `` P '' popping sounds , regardless close I got mic muted . So prepared addition sort `` pop filter '' device ( either one sold Amazon self-designed one , using nylon stocking ) .The mic clipped top computer screen mounted mic stand ( using supplied adapter ordering properly sized one Samson ) . Yet heavy base plus flexible , tilting mic , placed flat surface -- much like Snowflake , greater stability without intrusive cable . ( The Snowflake tends `` flop around , '' requiring balancing device user . ) My biggest disappointment thus far clip , another reviewer , open far enough attachment desk-top computer ( ideal fit notebook machines ) . Although Snowflake n't use spring clip , suffers limitation . If 're especially concerned durability , Snowflake appears heavier , rugged mic , thick metal tiny switches spring clips wear . The Samson delicate refined two . But n't kid . Either mic exceed capabilities computer 's built-in mic perhaps owner 's expectations .

560	Sound great , last much longer string I tried.Worth extra $ $ . Give try . These strings sound great , play great , coating really keep squeaking . Some purists n't like coating movement comes strings , take treble , last time . I usually change strings month . I use Washburn acoustic guitar , play rock , folk , country strumming . They rock , I feel best strings around today , period . These strings small , great playing long periods time , without fingertips . Some people say real light strings good recording , probably less bass boom , I like 'em . I 've using Godin Steel many years . They great , not-too-bright sound n't get string noise move hands across neck like traditional strings . These tend last 3 months ! So , I happy . They also track pretty well roland synth , gripes . All I really like strings think sound great . These Elixir Nanoweb acoustic guitar strings amazing sound like new strings long time ( months ) unlike guitar strings . Great product . These Extra Light strings light enough playing enjoyment , instead I buy Elixir Nanoweb strings singles I select gauges I like even better . A great product matter gauge string choose . I put set Elixir Nanoweb custom light strings main acoustic guitar maybe couple months ago . Although I n't play gigs , I play guitar every day , maybe every day . The custom lights wonderful : great durability , nice tone projection , easy fingers . I bought set Elixir extra lights Laguna 3/4 size travel guitar I . The reasoning lighter body guitar shorter scale could use lighter strings , thereby putting less stress body . Compared light D'Addario strings came guitar , muffled low E string . The A string , , n't project much standard strings . Although I 've tried extra lights full-sized acoustic , I suspect , , lower strings would presence ring brands . Even custom light set -- lower strings heavier gauge normal light set -- bass notes slight hint muffled quality . The thing players Elixirs seem talk playability durability . They smoother feeling non-coated strings , certainly n't degrade nearly quickly regular strings . The thing 's important know , though , Elixirs excellent holding tune , 're stretched broken . That said , I 'm sure I would put extra lights Laguna bass projection issue : small guitar little enough bass begin strings n't help . As might guessed , though , I 'm thoroughly convinced custom lights full-sized acoustic . I written reviews elixir . High quality strings . Great acoustic electric . No complaints strings . It time change many years using strings I really glad I tried Elixir . They feel really nice sound awesome , I sticking , thanks good prompt service well Cheers ! ! ! strings sound really great special nanoweb coating resistant corrosion rusting like strings tend get age . extra light gauge sound bright happy old tired sounds brand new throw strings . much recommended.. acoustic elixir electric strings well . 
561	It 's good OD , I thought would higher output , articulate . Just personal preference . I mean , Pedal Classic reason . This thing freaking rocks ! I LOVE pedal . I ca n't stop using . Sometimes I play long , drawn chords I listen amazing tone [ combo distortion amp - 's perfect metal ! ! ] like I looking money following purchase pedal boss arrives time necessary thank For money , I complaints . The enclosure , dials , footswitch durable . Not true bypass , none BOSS pedals . It n't suck tone . This pedal n't overdrive , asymmetrical clipping fills niche TS pedals n't . You lose little low end engaged , actually works pretty well especially humbuckers amps looser kind ' distortion encountered . As stand alone overdrive , I prefer pedals . But pedal really works boost dirtboxes already overdriven amp . You get singing , harmonic leads dialed right . Like overdrive , introduce noise pedal engaged things get hissy palm muting crank far . I dirtbox hoarder I like rotate pedals try different combinations . Lately , I running either V1 Cool Cat transparent overdrive ( Clone - , nice ) Behringer ( dead ringer Boss Blues Driver ) tube amp dialed mild crunch ( Jet City Combo Palomino Combo ) . As overdrive , thing sound good ( IMHO ) running solid state amp . That 's intended . It intended drive preamp tubes saturation YMMV . Because I 'm cheapskate ( things durable like bricks ) I bought used $ 20 , well worth new asking price . It 's yellow , metal , Boss . If want drive sound definition pedal get . The best OD I ever owned . Makes want see tone could cut board half . I picked order boost gain amp bit . It wonderful job ( Drive set low level set high . Tone set taste . ) The additional noise produces relatively low , wo n't excessive staticy buzzing sound deal . As Boss pedals , 's well made reliable . Bought one 15 yrs ago used died couple years back . This one favorite overdrive pedals ever . Smooth tone , right amount gain , perfect push tube amp . Plus dozens ( DIY pro ) mods available add lot potential . Recommended . I bought pedal used used Fender tube amp Marshall solid state using clean channels . I get variety tones different guitars , reccomend first overdrive add I several overdrive pedals , one good giving basic overdrive tones keeping amps low end . I get decent tones Telecaster Les keeping level tone knobs 12 o'clock adjusting drive taste.The OD sounds great Fender clean tubes I also tried bass guitar . With adjustment tone drive knob , bass overdriven tone good reviews prove pedal typical iconic Boss build quality . I find Boss pedals good purpose mostly modded ones I 've owned time , I may keep one use boost . These pedals last forever I paid $ 20 mine . This standard board along witht Blues Driver . This little yellow box bang buck going find Over Drive pedal . It tough , sounds like fire , serve well . For $ 50 seriously better deal . I use pedal time even DS-1 . Great buck From classic blues rock dial sound want . I held trying Boss SD-1 Super Overdrive many years . Like many guitarists , first distortion pedal Boss DS-1 , durable aggressive , also extremely frustrating . I might formed negative impressions Boss , probably unfair so.The SD-1 widely owned affordable ( usually around $ 50 ) . It 's similar lot ways Ibanez TS-9 Tubescreamer , except Tubescreamer reissue costs twice much . A lot guitarists consider SD-1 `` rock '' overdrive , TS-9 `` tube/blues '' effect . There 's probably truth , excellent , SD-1 really impressed transparency versatility . You CAN simply plug use alone clean channel . But n't necessarily best use pedal - excels `` booster '' pushing already overdrive amp , stacking distortion/OD pedals . One best settings turning Level way gain way . This adds little bit grit tone , really sounds feel lot people give SD-1 mediocre reviews reasons n't fair . You hear things like `` cuts much bass '' , 's really pedal supposed . The midrange hump , set properly , take away tone help cut band live playing . And , like I said , I feel 's MORE transparent retaining elements clean tone TS-9 , though preference two entirely subjective.But also know 's Boss pedal , means 's durable come . The thing stand years abuse , used number roles . If 're looking single pedal make small amp sound `` big '' , probably better options range . ( Try under-appreciated MD-2 Mega Distortion , excellent Joyo Ultimate Drive ) . But understand pedal supposed use purpose , 'll understand thing popular 30 years . Great booster , others said . For solos , 'll boost mids signal . As overdrive , 's great , kind , Marshally sound . It suck low end , fix amp board whatever . It 's Boss , 's solid - great price . Remember , overdrive - distortion . For distortion , look Boss pedals . I several overdrive pedals , much expensive BOSS SD-1 . For long time I overlooked SD-1 used pedals . But I went back trying SD-1 , I pleasantly surprised find relatively inexpensive pedal superior pedals I using . I n't mean merely 's `` good relative price '' ; I mean 's `` good -- period . '' It easily pedals I paid much . The price pedal sometimes goes $ 45 Amazon . At price , 's amazingly good deal . Note : This definitely pedal ; deliver metal distortion ( least ) . If want ride crazy train , look elsewhere ( like Deltalab 's Metal Distortion pedal ) . What produces smooth overdrive . It 's excellent . It sounds especially good dash chorus . I plug SD-1 Fender Mustang II amp turn amp 's chorus ; result delicious . I 've used SD-1 single-coil double-coil pickups . Both sound good , though , surprisingly , get heavier punch humbucker . But sounds great single-coils . 
562	These knobs arrived perfect condition , correct color fit Stratocaster remake well . You ca n't necessarily go wrong knobs . I like black look guitar . Need 2 volume knobs 1 tone , price ( past ) I always purchased 2 packs together issues , however recently I needed ordered I found 4 sets , consistency quality ... example lettering thinner others within set sets item # .

564	Still using today , 2 years later . For years I 've used super-cheap `` rake hangers '' get hardware stores - metal `` U '' coated rubber , heavy-duty screw end . These fine , except guitars n't want fit , recently trying widen mouth one weld failed `` U '' detached screw , got thinking I find better solution hanging guitars . The thing , I hate things . To , $ 15-20 way much guitar hanger . Sure , 's important something solid hold `` babies '' , I want feel like I 'm getting value.I bought 2 hangers , 're rock-solid . As others said - put good screws stud , n't bother hassle drywall anchors provided . I used 2 '' drywall screws . I like simplicity metal plate yoke attached . The U easy adjust width , retainer rings slide easily , I 've tried acoustic electric guitars hang away wall.No complaints - great , quality seems excellent $ 9 seems right . I older version model , works great . I opted use heavy weight wall anchors I got Home depot . 2 hangers rated hold 75 lbs 150 lbs worth peace mind ! The hanger I bought used , already assembled , I ca n't comment much assembly process . I bought 2 , holds precious basses tender care worry-free security ! And , I n't stock company ! : - ) I actually five various instruments , mostly bass guitars also acoustic solid-body mounted properly studs - way I mounted - , solid . While nice package instructions hardware wall board fasteners , I used brass wood screws studs appearance strength . You see ends screws used install complete , brass screw looks great & # 34 ; flat black & # 34 ; model.The model -- one -- works well kind guitar including bass acoustic . There variants instruments , relatively wide range held securely unit . The yoke width adjustable , combination slope two keeper rings prevent instrument coming ... consider means mounting carefully . easy install , holds guitar away wall somewhat , keeps floor away animals I case . great find , well worth purchase price . : ) I decided I wanted hang guitars walls instead take space via floor stands . Just find stud drill screws 'll hold fine . I 'm really bad comes stuff like I brother help . Just make sure know 're I thought I I really n't all.The wall hangers look really nice person , keep guitars held place . The thing extra purchasing installing creating wallpad behind guitar hung ; something happens makes hit wall , wo n't damage guitar wall.This legit gets done right , though ; I 've guitars hung via String Swing months I 've problems concerns . I pleased cheap alternative floor stands . It saves room makes room look cooler . cheap quality great cant complain . buying future guitars . I used side wooden bookshelf ukulele . It 's attractive . It 's well made . It 's fork tad large ukulele It rubber o-rings slide , I bring uke fit . But , even three inch deep uke close bookcase ( wall , use ) . The uke hits I put hanger , I put felt pad uke body hits uke players simply nail single nail wall use loop string around uke head tuners . This much less expensive , holds well , even low profile hanger , never drops uke . Consider needs.I 'd buy another ukulele . It likely works fine guitar , though.I deducted one point fact , even though 's adjustable ( o-rings ) , advertised ukes , n't work well . And 's heavy stylish , opinion . I Hercules wall hanger ( mechanical gripper ) electric guitars , 's fabulous ( guitars ; overkill lightweight ukuleles , maybe ) Stands Guitar Hanger : I use , less I like . I find friction tuner ukuleles fit well , tuners hit fork make uke tune . So , small instruments ( 'd try mandolins banjos ) , . For guitars , 's good Hercules . Easy mount , solid grip guitar . Only would , guitar least , hangs kind far wall . This obviously factor hang though . An acoustic would clear wall nicely , solid body electric sits inches away wall.Silicone coating forks retaining bands get good grip guitar , without marring even soft wood.I much prefer one waiting happen ' stands floor . Very nice product great quality . I ordered three start sure I wanted trust Guitars . Arrived installed minutes come plastic toggles screw drywall I chose hit studs . Rubber washers come size different necks . If going mount stud I strongly suggest using aftermarket high quality toggle made steel . Very happy going order . good item musician need ! cool bass , guitar instrument fit hanger Will hold guitar I 've seen . It holds guitar wall safely without worry falling . It 's also easy install . It 's great price ; 's definitely worth investment . Not guitars ground , save space putting walls , , make room look even better . This thing works great looks stylish guitar hanging wall . This also keeps away kids always seem want play . Very good idea holds perfectly . Purchased two hang guitars home . I saw used guitar shop I assumed sufficient use home . I 'm using acoustic electric guitars . They appear designed hang guitar away wall avoid back . The hooks stretched apart squeezed together fit headstock guitar . Overall , attractive , well-made hangars . I love string swings ! My guitars cases display . I 3 home : 2 guitars 1 ukulele ... I 'm planning buying 25 school ukulele program . They look great wall . I love things . They hold guitars place make storage solution nice decoration process ! Holds acoustic 6 string great . Up reach baby learning walk , wife also things looks attractive wall art piece . Quality product good price . This clever idea . It helps save floor space rooms , helps cover empty wall space . Very easy take . High recommend stringed-instrument players . The mounting process simple.Recommendation : Buy cheap magnetic stud finder n't already one . You n't want instrument plummeting floor ! I got stud finder Amazon mounted two hangers . They 're holding well . The backs guitars practically flush wall . Whether 's good thing ... . I guess I n't worry potentially swinging wall much bumped . So maybe good thing.Be careful hang though . It could definitely hit wall n't place hanger carefully . hold weight guitars . easy install guess cheap . doesnt always come screw covers doesnt really matter I bought 2 hung 2 fender strats wall . Comes mounting screws anchors needed mount properly . Could n't happier product .

567	This pad great midi 's , Drums , , 's got great action ! Works great Ableton , Reason , FL Studio , Performer whole bunch DAWs software little lame n't always work properly ... n't really need much anyways ... 's whatever.. After online research , I decided buy ( found locally ) midi pad use Reason 4 . Although confirmed ( online ) working Reason , I happy see worked immediately problems . My Windows 7 , worked netbook also . This unit also worked Ableton Live ( stated online ) . I would recommend pad anyone looking affordable midi drum pad works many music programs . I Native Instruments ... find using even often . You program whatever MIDI values want . The pads solid devices several times expensive . I share sentiments.The pads little stiff , works , job small package ! Fit 's Macbook bag - I love pads knobs . I used Live 8 . The software side requires bit configuration work software , ultimately stable functional ... With laptop , USB power supply must noisy , LPD8 lose connection power even gently touch one cables -- however , works fine I use ( cheap ! ) powered USB hub . I suspect contain adequate filtering power supply . So may work star , I really love configuration I willing add gratuitous USB hub another wall wart road rig . Nice try , . [ Updated update ! 12 ] I tried different LPD8 compare -- problem ! On systems old LPD8 would flaky , new LPD8 rock solid . It appears I broken one intermittent problem . If problem , send back 's still warranty.So 's nice . Now 's really great product I , um , sort recommend everyone . However , considering AKAI `` professional '' us QC , I 'd suggest saving shipping box case need return exchange ... least weeks .

569	Good grippy picks types playing . I go back forth Jazz IIIs I 'm Jazz pick kind mood ( i.e . : I 'm using Jazz picks Fender heavies . I especially dig Davas ( models ) acoustic playing strumming . Nice tone well . Have tried pretty much every Dava pluses specific kinds playing.One thing Davas pick slightly move grip , I 'll pick string rubber . Hand angle also play part . Probably . I 've trying different picks weeks looking perfect one hybrid picking . So far one I think search actually . I 've tried theJim Dunlop 427P3 Dun Ultex Jazz close one . These Davas great feel bigger fingers , n't slip around sharp fast alternate hybrid picking . Pick noise also reduced much less friction others ; notes ring clearly even fast runs . I 've used Dunlop Jazz III 's years always problem came song required lot strumming . The DAVA changes . Not allow accurate picking , also allows strum needed - roll thumb back little ( works great ) . I 've using pick 2 months gone back picks . A definite 5 star favorite new pick ! ! ! You wo n't dissapointed ! ! ! These new style guitar pick . Thought I 'd give try . OK ... probably n't try long enough I rate three stars . The seller fail way . Have user Jazz III picks lately ( Max Grip version : Dunlop Max Grip Jazz III Carbon Fiber Guitar Picks - 6 Pack ) difficulty picks rhythmic sections required lots strumming.Was recommended picks users I gave shot . A notes : - This pick slightly bigger Jazz iiis linked . I like lot . The tip almost exactly size , top grip area ever slightly bigger . Still , picks significantly smaller `` average '' size The rubber grip area joy hold . Very comfortable , stable , lots If n't know , Dava picks dont come varying thickness . They instead `` control '' picks . depending grip pick become less rigid . Look picture -- - see three horizontal lines middle pick ? Those reference -- - pick ( lowest line near tip ) leads pull back flexible strumming . This take time get used pretty nice theory . However , even choking pick , rigid jazz iiis sometimes fast work I wishing I still holding jazz These Dava Jazz come three colors : Red ( Delrin material ) , Yellow ( Nylon material ) , Orange ( Gel ) . Different materials produce different sounds/feels . Also , opinion , gel little harder two.Hope review helped Title says I guess , gives small pick feeling without thickness ( I 'm crazy Dunlops ) , traction certainly better hands . Bought 3 months ago I 've got say 're durable , certainly small-pick alternatives I tried . These picks good grip . They 're pointy , 're good fast picking . They 're small , size nickle , 've warned . As Dava picks , wear pretty quickly . That 's price pay flexible pick I guess . A nice pick , feel , texture design . I picked started strumming immediately felt something different - something smoother comfortable , natural . I 'm satisfied pick ! There 's little message label , & # 34 ; Warning : may improve playing & # 34 ; 's joke ! Only complaint 's fairly small - size Canadian US five cent piece , typical guitar pick bigger - size 25 cent piece . But 's okay . I got time I got set Jim Dunlop 427P3 Dun Ultex Jazz III , yellowish ones , Dunlop Max Grip Jazz III Carbon Fiber Guitar Picks , I think I like one best . All three & # 34 ; tight grip & # 34 ; picks , size , I 'd say I like one best three ( 're good , though - I 'd rate 427P3 next-best , Jazz III Carbon Fiber next ) .One complaint - sent mine bloody great big oversized padded envelope suitable CDs . Kind overkill , ask , six picks , I n't complain - arrived great condition ! ! ! 
570	Got put project guitar . Love ! Be warned , NOT come springs , claw trem bar . If order , get tremolo bar Mexican model . The threads smaller these.If like & # 34 ; dive bombs & # 34 ; , need grind bevel small portion massive sustain block . It hit back cavity getting anywhere near absolute important note ... Make sure measure outer pivot screw distance . If matches spec Trem , screw holes match . I gave 5 star simple fact tremolo bigger block sustain better around intonation cheaply made guitar , I replaced one came squier strat let say sustain tone shaped guitar , stays better tune sounds amazing , I also replace tuners chinese made squier well also helps tone , sustain intonation playing ability guitar This intended replace MIM 6 screw Stratocaster bridge . It comes bridge , body screws , back springs , arm ... nothing . That 's 's inexpensive . What see picture said , great value want spruce MIM Strat . The block HUGE compared standard MIM bridge . It incredibly easy install . And sustain tip I forgot , tighten 6 screws body way . The bridge loose enough bridge move like hinge . The springs back keep back . The string tension keeps balanced front . What I tighten body screws way , loosened one 1/4 turn back . Very nice bridge . This OEM part n't come screws , springs , claw , tremolo bar , bridge . Not best price killer deal . The block full size , probably zinc mystery metal , vintage bent saddles . Would good replacement older MIM Strat smaller block , Asian import , replace one 's wore . Like I stated dirt cheap decent quality . This bridge heavily constructed , amplified sound much vibrant alive . It must weigh twice much bridge old Indiana Custom Guitar . I 'm glad I replaced . Now I lot guitar money . I probably spent $ 200 total Fender bridge assembly , locking tuners , Tex-Mex pickups , well original $ 59 used guitar , I would say I functional equivalent $ 500 Fender Stratocaster , based sound quality ease fingering . This time money well spent . 
571	Its easy set use . Simple instructions sticker bottom . I soak easy 2-3 weeks . Ca n't tell 's truly working maple wood ukulele . I using many years . They simple use offer banjos good humidification . I place Herco neck section case another section head sits.For guitars I place Herco near peg head stringed instrument humidifier slips strings . Great insurance damage instruments . I like humidifiers . Works keep instrument case , upkeep minimal . Work strings well , careful , easy fall case , careful ! one guitar case keep right humidity . A must us dry . It n't seem work . I think maybe mine damaged something n't seem absorb water . I taking lessons qualified instructor mentioned I need humidifier guitar . At first I sure I looking . I found product without much difficulty . I learned instructor small , placed hole guitar , definitely needed keep guitar good playing condition . I started looking computer pages settled Herco Guitar Humidifier recommendations thew product . Now I feel I made wise choice able keep quitar playing good vibrations , good music ! Herco Jim Dunlop company little humidifier suggested someone used awhile . Dunlop trusted brand guitar maintenance part . I wanted stay away typical humidifiers due tendencies leak stain guitar wood . I used weeks still remians moist . The product came fast instructions straight forward . I may order another one performs well . I used use Martin tube thing stick strings . But bit pain . You soak , drain , wipe . Even , I worried dripping inside guitar . This much easier guitar sounds great . Highly recommended . 
572	Quick accurate . I also like use bypass mode standby switch changing guitars . register notes well pickups engaged though . If like love playing music , good buy . It pretty much 's supposed . So , plug 's ready use . It 's pretty fast , accurate 's price . Light weight.The thing takes little longer tune 6th string.Overall , 's good enough buy . Its pretty delayed , n't display notes long , I play drop G , gets job done . The construction n't something I wan na step , bag better paying $ 100 Bought early March year & in-line effects pedals pedal board . No problems . It works advertised . I 've found better quality board tuner comes Fender G-Dec amp tell ? Not sure low ratings pedal I love mine . For money ca n't get one touches . So 's $ 100+ ? That means green stuff buy things.Since buying one & work well , I couple Behringer pedals . Every Guitarist needs good tuner ! everyone knows Boss makes best products . The fact tho I really cant afford spend tuner ! When I received unit I decided first thing I going compare hand held chromatic tuners . They work . Using pedal I able obtain results , 's good enough . tuner takes little 2-3 seconds , 's fine since I usually tune within breaks hardly need tune especially good pegs . musicians budget deal , best still powerful read signal strings acoustic guitar Boss tuner , electric bass accurate . u budget . WOW , I got I expected Chromatic Tuner , Sure 's plastic case , would rough pedal anyways , 3 weeks , im impressed , I see people say blue indicator light bright , truthfully , OK , tuner lights plenty bright enough , bright , put little piece black tape light , like said OK cause still see tuner lights , I use pedal theVisual Sound One Spot Combo Pack , works like charm . issues , got could tune stage playing without making lots noise . works great , exactly says , definetly get power supply , never worry battery . said headline used 3 times . Look pedal . Look , costs . $ 30 tuner pedal form factor , 's n't even try hunt lower price . By contrast , Boss 's TU-2 essentially thing durable housing , costs $ 100 retail.Yes , housing made plastic . I n't know , I generally wo n't leaping feet onto tuner middle set . If treat gear respect whatsoever , survive . And n't , ? It 's cheap replace.The person obviously got faulty model , happens . Mine 's developed touchy input jack time ( 's actually earlier model ) , I n't know 's totally unexpected pedal cheap . One star kinds quality control problems , fair . I three Behringer pedals well , 're still going strong.A tuner essential part musician 's rig , job fine . Use money save towards buying really nice stompbox actually affect sound playing.UPDATE : After used new tuning pedal time , I admit , yes , subpar tuner . However , I still stand original opinion amount money pay , n't bad investment . For guitarist starting , would still make good first tuner really want spend money pedals affect sound . This gigging pedal . You time tune pedal gig , 're planning gigging next month spend $ 50 Korg . However 're at-home player wants mess around regular electric tuners , worth price . It sits right pedal board , signal 's 's cables everytime want switch standard Drop D , 's accurate Korg . It 's also slow . It takes good 2-3 seconds register change , fine 're practicing even recording home seconds n't crucial . I recommend something little faster need tune quickly songs . Seems great need time explore ... This workk well however I get residual noise causes meter shift flat side range . I may need new cables . Not bad , unit tunes really well , Boss original , difference one takes like 1 sec respond pedal activated , Boss , units behave exactly . Some criticize brand making cheap clones truth making musicians budget great favor , want spend $ 100 tuner one perfect ; since I collector I brands compare ( Boss , Korg , Fender ... ) thing , accurate Boss , least mine , good mute switch also , I happy mine ... . thing works fine ... easy understand settings enough.. lights nice bright . like power supply best

576	First , I love picks used exclusively years . I dozens , never wear . I used use playing loud rock band , never issues . They comfortable , easy bad : sound . Not sound plucked , hard plastic pick string makes noticeable `` plinking '' sound audible amp . If 're playing loud music , may issue . But I essentially stopped using I started playing different band dynamics , quieter passages plinking sound pick strings VERY noticeable , bad . I think great picks , I 'd like made softer material . I got picks week ago fell love . I generally use Dunlop pick , switch thinner pick rhythm play . This , course , annoying , especially playing rhythm lead parts song . These Big Stubby picks solved problem . They easy hold onto , great leads , way shaped n't hang strings like regular picks . Great picks . Definitely worth little extra cost . So , picks really nice , picture get . These picks translucent purple . Other strange color , good picks . They really help speed accuracy . Great mandolin playing.Updated : Amazon changed image item , picture really show get . I always find interesting different opinions products . Some n't like sound , others say wear day ( really -- play 24 hours ? ) . Some say grip good . Here 's take -- 's worth . I 've listened hollow semi hollow body guitars . Round flat wound strings . My general take picks give better , fuller , rounder bigger tone overall . Compared tortex style pick material ( 1 mm tortex ) . It 's bit hard determine sound comes material , thickness combination . Also note , I play rounded edge , tip . So grip center n't quite fit grip style 's still ok . I find get slippery faster tortex materials hands sweat . I 've subjective comparisons -- I 've found far . I find stand , sound wise , guitars I 'm currently playing . The process finding `` right '' pick never ending changes time . Give try let know think . These picks R awsome ! I tremmors hands hard thime pick control ... Have center , tingles , It feels like Your Hand GREAT seem better picks rather ordinary picks.These picks indentation U know put UR thumb index really Do say ... .If U hand problems , try ... really work . I dont know called big stubby . They small side . Way thick . They sound good though last long time . I feel like I playing nickle . I like indentation . Helps grip lot . I paid attention size thickness . Still looking right picks . If slimmer bit larger I would buy . Looking picks bass , one work , thick hard , good thumb picks work , use fingers . The thing picks plectrums prefer really matter preference pick one ( pun intended ) try stick get used practice . I 've used many different types picks years I 've found ideal one recently I decided use basically standard triangle thin design made silver I find fits needs best far 's case getting used . This particular Dunlop pick described fat , stubby sturdy nice centre kind lead guitarist uses lot pinch harmonics pick good maximum grip comfortable holding position little pick face . The hardness make good fast playing thickness also makes difficult get firm grip small size makes easy lose grip hit strings hard . This makes unfit bass players strumming although could get used lead guitar playing . For though , I 'll keep among collection picks use 's default preferred choice play . I admit I 'm guitar friends , I find pick perfect picking mandolin . The picks almost zero flex , meaning player solid control . I like 'em -- even purple . If 're worried 3.0 mm big guitar , 're probably right.If n't use pick bass , n't want want pick bass , plectrum ! When I first got , I thought going cheap , felt extremely light came cheap packaging , ok , I n't expecting much . The picks actually made extremely sturdy material . They bend I tried ( believe , I tried ) . Pick wearing virtually non-existent , I utilize lot practices . I actually learned first sweep shred ( D major ) picks within day getting them.I highly recommend shred complaint , pinch harmonics kind hard ( becuase grip ) got used rather quickly.IMPORTANT ! ! ! You get 24 packs [ ... ] $ 10 ! ! ! Free shipping well ! Sorry , Amazon , good deal pass ... I purple makes stick . They little cut make easier grip hold I playing mandolin . Already planning purchasing . These picks unique shape sound helped play faster smoother tone.Unfortunately , picks receive five-star rating price lack durability . They wear fast . Mine usually worn day use I n't think I play particularly hard . At around $ 4.50 six picks , expensive pieces , picks full awesome I compelled pay little extra . I definitely buying . Currently favorite pick , 's thick enough control makes easy handle . I 'd recommend guitarists jazz , fusion like . I first want mention pack 6 picks . The product description n't mention , I pleased receive three ! My son told needed new picks , since lately 's playing Ozzy songs I knew needed better pick standard Fender picks 's playing three years . After hearing play picks , I 've noticed play faster accurately . The finger grips help tremendously really helped bring playing next level . My complaint sent us pack purple picks . I wish could choose color , maybe could send color assortment . We 'll buying long time come . another item never received would use anything .88 mm anyway mean experimentation learned since purchase . The right pick personal preference . Nothing wrong Dunlop Stubby Pick , 's . I bought pack 2.0mm picks last year loved left Florida I went north . I forgot name favorite pick bought mistake . I bought wanting try nylon Big Stubby sent purple ones instead . I wanted mention item description vague ( ) item pictured nylon . I 'm still happy purchase picking dynamics Jazz Stubby give much larger surface grip . I bought first set long time ago perfect ! Then I re-ordered I got I think acoustic type 2.0mm gauge small comfortably hold , I ended two dozen wasted picks . So make sure get right Update : Okay , I realized `` Dunlop Stubby Picks '' `` Dunlop BIG Stubby Picks '' Sorry ... I 've using primary pick years I love . The way material surrounds finger tips unique found flat pick . They 're easy keep grip allow go strings however find sweet spot life pick 's tip . When first use business end extremely pointy , sharp almost . After playing bit , tip begins round perfect long time . Eventually , really rounds 'll want fresh one . I typically lose wear nice , wo n't care . How guitar pick `` feels '' , matter individual preference , really n't seem much point trying rate , I like particular type pick , may relevant another player . Most picks high ratings , players like particular type , write reviews rate highly . Obviously , best thing playing pick guitar , n't always possible . With said , worth , thoughts regarding Jim Dunlop 's purple colored , Big Stubby 3.0mm picks.I like pick sharp point better control , Big stubby certainly meets criteria . The sharp point pick 's rounded edges , help Stubby slide smoothly individual strings , makes easier picking . Besides electric guitar , I find picks nicely suited acoustic , semi-solid body guitars , string tension tried 1.0mm Stubby previously , 3.0mm pick much thicker , heavier , absolutely `` give '' . I 'm still getting used playing something stiff hard . Although pick rounded side fingers , picking rapidly , I find maintaining grip still little tricky . Keeping pick clean dry , favorite pick theDunlop nylon pick , I pleased performance feel 3.0mm Stubby . I locate strings easily , precise , still able play decent speed . Time tell , may become new favorite pick.The `` pick pack '' contains 24 picks . I paid $ , simply outstanding deal . If 're player looking really stiff almost indestructible pick , might want give ultra heavy duty Stubby try . Using stubby spoiled picks . You simply play faster , matter level . picking speeds increase drag . Now I use flat picks acoustic play I want hear crunch . 24 picks pack , insane bargain . You pay twice much store .

Add possible lines headphones adapter look like possible function bean shape make making odd put anywhere belt clip sticking . The menu accessed using 4 position finger pad . The main rotaries front two functions depending whether holding another key access second set . This extremely difficult need switch settings live environment . I multiple mistakes POD really belongs desktop DAW recording . It n't much value belt clip . Still effects rack . I scored virtually unused pre-owned unit $ 50 . It packed features little bit learning curve want really make use features , simple plug play operation possible . My original thought use unit interface recording PC . My considerable - unit sounds digital me- particularly chord note starts decay fade . I probably would loved thing I started playing ( years ago I care admit ) . I prefer genuine tube driven amp analog pedals . Does make 'gear snob ' ? Not consider low watt tube amps cheaply manufactured pedals days ; ) I 've also owned Tech 21 Trademark 60 analog modeling amp ( bad traded ) still Tech 21 TRI AC analog preamp ( great pedal keeper ) - ' sounded better ears digital modelers . I prefer analog way around . I eventually gave unit away someone taken guitar . He likes I gave 3 stars 's good way junior experement effects practice without annoying neighbors . The Good : This good tool practice guitar Bad : The tones good stretch imagination , unless like noise . The cleans sound artificial crunch tones obvious digital distortion applied . The effects hit miss well . Plate reverb decent spring reverb artificial sounding 's downright fact batteries , software interface use program computer really difficult use , loses small-and-portable-factor guitar cable , headphone cable , power adapter plugged , I 'd recommend product unless really need practice headphones . I Line 6 POD worked computer great effects stuff best actually practicing away computer decided time change . I considered different brands even Line 6 POD models . I even ordered POD XT cancel order I realized download tones Line 6 website add user memory banks easy retrieval.As many said , batteries come last long , kind expected .

I going knock star since put belt clip reason , like still like sit desk every , stay put heavy enough , I found put two rubber bands either side helps & # 34 ; grip & # 34 ; better stay put n't slide right happy purchase would highly recommend guitarist needs great tones practice . I n't play live I say well would work . I wanted portable headphone amp bought instead bucks offers ton features . Though 's perfect , 's like room full guitar effects different : 32 amp models , 16 cabinet models , effects + thousands available presets = ; good software managing tones creating new ones ; used front amp ( case want know modeled would sound coming real Vox ) ; lots connectivity ; compact enough I keep unit , cable power supply case ; tech problems ; built-in noise gate tuner ; easy-to-use tap : There 's learning curve need manual know stuff like change amp models ; manual pdf file ; hard keep track preset tones unit ( though rename re-arrange software ) ; presets based famous songs n't always sound right ; minor background hum ; uses 4 AAA 's hours manual says n't use rechargables ( though n't say ) ; reasons , unit uses generic amp names ( check manual match amp model names amps 're based ) ; everything plugged whole setup becomes little unwieldy ; n't sound nice good pedal Marshall half stack ( kidding , right ? And I still n't sound like Lee ) .As inexpensive effects box also works portable headphone amp , thing cool . You wo n't get bored need learn use . Master amp/cab models tweak gain , reverb , delay , etc . dive presets .

585	I got plug computer . It comes wealth programs amp combos . The unit works planned even though think may stick Sonar far editor . Sorry Behringer maybe later . The quality durability 100 % well worth paid . I excited get product use electric guitar product plugs usb port guitar plugs 1/4 & # 34 ; port ( product specs show say 1/4 plug port ) .My product orange USB light instead blue one . The support people Behringer tell changed color match logo ( sounds like BS ) .The problem I reason I bought I tried plugging guitar directly computer adapter chord . It works levels low . When I received , I hopeful levels would higher , much . It step adapter , far professional . I 'd say level level sound quality.I bought & # 34 ; like new & # 34 ; product describing faded damaged packaging . When arrived , box dented ( I n't care ) product looked new inside . But , instructions described blue USB light CD driver recording software come . Behringer gave link download . I assure 's beware . For mac , garageband far better easier use.Rock ! I previously using Rocksmith USB Cable , wanted specific cable iMac . This unit definitely fits bill , I hear playing , even lower latency RS cable . I getting little unwanted slapback RS cable , unit seems taken care . It 's also quite nice headphone jack right front quiet practice times.The software comes Interface joke , useful disc . Since I use Logic Pro X MainStage 3 n't loss , buying interface fact comes & # 34 ; Amp & # 34 ; , might want look somewhere else . I could n't even get software load 2013 iMac . Use record guitar Garage Band . Works sounds really good . I would recommend . Great value This product turned great exceptions . It comes three amplifier software packages says license turn one three , true . The license included works one amp , AC box combo two , need purchase license . Plus instructions getting system installed operational poor . You run output sound card PC speakers due latency . You must use headphone jack interface . In addition environment ca n't get internet register product immediately luck trying make work . Once overcome good little product . I use practice computer keep disturbing wife studying daughter sleeping . Great little box ! I ordered I could plug guitar computer record music . Works well . Quality German manufacturing always . Nice . I would definitely recommend . It worked windows 7 starter , Acer netbook . The Behringer UCG102 device aging ( yet affordable ) piece hardware offers intriguing option plugging guitar directly USB port computer . This opens number possibilities recording simply playing headphones . For budget player , could mere $ 32 investment unlocks world free amp modeling recording possibilities.However , actual hardware compact seems function properly , significant problems . First foremost , problem getting device work , getting software recognize , configuring run without significant `` latency '' ( delay effect n't hear played note immediately 's played , make monitoring anywhere frustrating impossible ) . The UCG102 runs ASIO driver . They include older version software , snoop around online find options . But n't mean necessarily work software , work well . For example , Audacity popular `` '' program use record mix audio files computer . I 've told Audacity n't work ASIO drivers , I got record , latency issues rendered unusable.You receive two software options device . The first , I believe includes license compact version . In theory , program work like Audacity contains number amp models effects , addition drum bass track loops . However , I little luck figuring monitor record program . I 'm sure CAN work , need computer science degree figure , 's really ideal budget product.The second item trial disc Guitar Native Instruments . So far , impressive options offered . You demo three different amp simulators ( Vox , Fender , Marshall ) enter code unlock one three . I like gives interface similar real guitar amp , allows dial realistic tones . It 's also program I 've able get headphone jack play ears ( problems recognizing mono vs. stereo ) . I adjusted sound quality get latency 8 miliseconds , range I n't notice problem . Still , models sound good , I 'm sure often I would bother plugging computer basic playing recording.Shortly ordering device , I discovered sound card blue `` line '' audio jack back . By running simple 1/8 '' 1/4 '' audio cable pedal board sound card , I direct recording , monitored computer speakers ( latency ) sounds great . Even better , method works Audacity allows record layer tracks . If UCG102 worked advertised , would convenient way , I simply ca n't recommend people . I feel like 's `` 4-star '' potential somewhere device , I doubt I 'll ever patience unlock . 3 stars . ..it works.But expect , finding driver use n't come software disc , look Behringer 's support site driver driver use kills audio , ca n't run player get sound.My advice unless dedicated PC laptop using ... get something else .

Sold cash . After deciding bite silver bullet purchase BOSS ME-70 Multi-Effects simplify gigging setup , I figured nice Analog Distortion like Metal Muff , would never compete Digital Distortion onboard ME-70 ... boy I wrong . After getting ME-70 , I A/B test ME-70 took home gold easily . This came surprise ... considering BOSS MXR respected manufacturers comes Distortion sounds.What would I recommend purchase ? That depends . If 're metal band , 're recording EP , pedal opinion comes close tube-amp distortion . However , amp n't good distortion channel capability , conservative ( affordable ) BOSS DS-1 musical metal tone . The reality , manufacturers great distortion pedals , really depends subjective standards tone ... since two distortions sound . Personally , I recommend MXR Fullbore Metal ... pedal I wish I bought instead Metal Muff . The Noise Gate Mid switches far better pedal accessories Top Boost . The Fullbore also Mid Frequency shaping knob ... dramatically shape overall sound . 's metal . first words I said plugging thing line . With wide range sound versatility one pedal two buttons awesome . The issue manufacturing detail . The input put jacks screwed nearly broke cables trying set first time . The buttons way stiff made horrid crunch first time I used talking amazon turns seems . Be sides metal , nothing nothing less . sharp high ends butt muddy slop sound either way covered pedal . I 3 versions pedal cherish . If need control EQ , This pedal switchable top boost ticket . More versatile Sovereign . This pretty awesome pedal , especially 're going 80 's 90 's metal sound 's chunky defined fizzy . Think earlier Mesa models , like famous Mark III used Metallica Master Puppets album . Of course pedal perfectly replicate sound , Metal Muff pretty amazing best aspects Metal Muff . Great clarity definition , even higher gain settings . Seriously , high gain pedals cause lose lot definition playing , metal muff n't . So especially lead guitarist , major selling point.2 . Wide range tone controls . With pedals 's really hard hear difference adjust tone controls , metal muff . You easily dial sound 're , maybe even find new sound like even . The quality construction absolutely superb . Everything pedal rugged durable . I 'd feel totally comfortable gigging without different note , I 've used pedal Fender Hotrod tube amp , sounds great . However , I prefer Rocktron Zombie pedal Metal Muff ( see review Zombie info ) . However , Rocktron Zombie n't sound good solid state amps . I mention 're using tube amp , I honestly feel Zombie better option . But 're playing solid state amp , I 've read metal muff still shines . Just something conclude , pedal awesome 're looking pedal give all-round good , straight-up metal sound . Sure , 's bit one-trick pony , 's pretty good trick . If 're looking ultra high-gain distortion monster look else , otherwise I recommend giving Metal Muff look .

589	Firm picking surface flexible body feels bit natural rigid pick . They slightly larger normal dunlop pick much contoured body makes much easier easy hold , I play night without dropping . Depending hold stiffness changes . That comes handy . They make another version less pointy ... I like one little bit better . pickers like fumble conventional picks onto floor , particularly skin dry winter . The grip material molded onto picks goes long way toward preventing . The material used core gives slightly softer tone Fender mediums I used 50 years . I like feel picks , slight give center , allowing player vary pick attack strumming picking single notes . These good picks , I 've tried gel pick 's plastic pick 's , The gel pick 's come close , But great , Because I Problem 's , plastic/rubber grip Is perfect ... ... ... ... I still little Trouble controlled pick droping pick definitely def Do recommend anyone dexterity . These picks seem well made solid feel , I 'm sure I like sound . Like many guitarists , I go lot picks , searching feels sounds best I . I n't -- least acoustic . Whatever I n't like got drowned I tried electric . Since I 've playing acoustic lately , I might might buy . I used think pick pick , difference stiffness . ( I say I prefer picks medium stiffness ) . The problems I `` regular '' picks : ( 1 ) slipping hand ( turning around ) , ( 2 ) hand ( floor ) , , course , ( 3 ) breaking . I decided give Dava picks try . I bought pack `` jazz '' picks pack `` grip tips '' . I really thought I 'd like jazz picks better : would easier grip like regular pick . But , trying , I find ( grip trips ) `` pick choice '' . They fit grip perfectly , stay put hand , give maximum control I play , whether 's lead rhythm . I yet break one . I 'm mainly buying another set I 've given away people try I want plenty readily available . I like leave picks laying around house various optimum locations , whenever I pick guitar play , I 've got one close ( also always keep spare wallet ) . Bottom line , least , picks tops ! Sure I still use regular pick 's 's available . But use best I ? ? ? Update : Been using picks year since first review . Still love . Still yet break one ( I aggressive strummer ) . The reason I need buy : I lose . I admit bit pricey , compared picks . But , still tops . Which I 'm buying another half dozen . I tons picks well made easy hold hand without slipping around much . I absolutely LOVE picks . Grips really well hand , plays like dream . I wish came pack . I would HIGHLY recommend anyone want great picks . These look neat brother I unknowingly ordered gifts last Christmas . Unfortunately feel chunky use colored tip grips strings unfortunate way making difficult play . Dava picks one life 's guilty little pleasures . They may seem pricey picks , 're still expensive . I bought batch picks I realized Davas three years back use play slide . I also Fender Musician 's Friend picks , standard flat stamped-out pieces plastic . The Davas offer much better grip greater sense control . And plain feel good use . The picks tendency slip slide , Dava get great grip . I playing guitar off/on 30 years . I always used whatever cheap picks I could find laying around snagged music shops -- free ones give try guitar shop : ) Always Medium gauge , acoustic electric . I decided try Dava 's cheap looked cool , n't expecting much , I mean , pick pick , right ? Wrong . These little guys fantastic `` feel '' ; seem get strings effortlessly flat picking . It 's crazy I experiencing . They maybe bit thin side , overly , I got used quick . Plenty stiff enough enthusiastic strumming picking . , produce nice , crisp , slightly metallic string sound I rather like . I recorded today perhaps bit loud side regards audible pick attack strings acoustic ( Breedlove ) . But bad I using sensitive Rode condenser . Have n't played much electric yet ( customized Fender Stratocaster ) I 'm sure fine well . I like picks LOT ordering dozen keep around . Good stuff . 
590	I purchased rack last year hold outboard recording gear . I liked fact open back I could patch things easily I bought patch bay . I find sturdy well made , I 've loaded almost completely full . I recommend placing heavier units towards bottom . great rack . small enought fit top table . light weight holds lot . point I 2 behringer amps , power conditioner 2 single unit audio processors . First , audio racks annoying & # 34 ; slide little metal pieces rails put screws & # 34 ; instead properly sized holes . Not one . Not holes get made proper size threads , even includes 48 screws n't try figure 3 sizes 've collected years going fit.I loaded equipment n't worry since . Solid construction mounting works . This one done right . Simple useful rack stand . Easy assemble . Easy mount rack components ... rubber leg terminals easy lose . A little interest manufacture means quality . This exactly item I needed podcasting rig . It holds Behringer mixer along compressor vocal processing box . It lets move whole thing easily way I need use table something besides podcasting.The stand easy assemble well built . There 's nothing bad I say , need hold audio gear reservations picking one . Highly recommended . This stand great Peavey 1500 . It light weight rack I put amp toward bottom . I would n't put much exactly I needed . I grab rack top bracket move around easily . Have n't tried gigging gentle I think would work fine . This rack stand made heavy steel , welded together well . I received rack stand yesterday , put together 5 minutes . My audio equipment mounted easily , 48 mounting screws , everything looks great , I n't worry thing collapsing falling . It sturdy , stable . I recommend anyone planning rack 12 audio devices . I definitely purchasing another rack stand I fill one . I add pictures rack stand setup shortly . I 've month n't fallen apart I guess 's plus , main issue rackmount whatever automated machine used drill screw holes definitely defective , large majority holes slightly deformed take provided screws therefore . Thanks problem I able use TWO slots . It 's definitely frustrating although price tempting , stay away . ok , hard use bottom space angle , gear must short fit bottom space hitting mounting surface ... rack , ... . I use mobile DJ equipment fantastic . Very sturdy light enough easily carry . screw mounts perfectly placed allow easy component installation . Plastic covers feet came right away though , really big deal . I 've uploaded customer-supplied images show much gear one capable holding small stage studio footprint . When factor price 's plain see rack bargain , flexible platform mounting characteristic images reveals table-top rack . They work well rack easy assemble built like tank . I bass amp head power amp , plus power conditioner one racks , combined , weighs around 50 pounds . The rack stressed strained weight , could probably hold another 50 pounds safely reliably . Another plus comes bag high quality mounting screws components , eliminating expense ( I expecting Rack Screws With Hardware ( Pack 25 ) , turned completely unnecessary . ) My complaint rubber feet caps easily fall , little glue rectified rather trivial problem.If need portability , reliability value smaller gear suites frequently moved ( setting stages ) ideal solution rack mounted equipment . I pleased mine I intend purchase another one , bringing total three . I purchased help unclutter desk recording gear . This stand stable useful ! So want cheap way rack stuff way go !

592	Good metal distortion tone bags sustain sucks lot tone ( metal pedals ) moderately noisy . If looking classic rock sounds wo n't find . Can get muddy times plenty settings tweak get sound looking . I find useful high gain leads palm mute rhythms note definition good chords . For price pedal good deal though ! I 've 11 years . Even newer metal pedals market , pedal still sells well . Not mention , 's probably also one modded pieces . Any number mods found online change sound . They 're usually side improving stock tone , I 'm happy with.I 've always liked parametric EQ pedal . The variable midrange allows get Marshall Mesa flavors . For metal/hard rock music , gain range enough . If I need yet gain , I punch overdrive , compressor pedal cleaner boost . Even without boost , I use death metal . I think play tighter , technical styles , 's better much gain anyhow . To honest , I looking pedal would give distortion similar Megadeth 's first album . So far I got perfect setup yet , ive got close enough . This pedal great , couple notes I make . Do NOT buy pedal expecting play classic rock , rock general . This pedal metal . The battery drains like MF . I dont understand . The possible explanation I think I leave plugged guitar amp , ive pedals wouldnt drain battery unless TURNED ON . I prefer get AC adapter use batteries . Other things iv problems great pedal . I lot pedals ... In fact , I 2 distortion 2 overdrive pedals ( though regularly rig . ) This pedal wo n't give `` cranked tube stack '' sound . No ... Instead , 's edgy smooth . It knob help sculpt tone . I usually use solos . You 'll find get amazing sustain huge sound wo n't able replicate ( easily ... I 'm sure huge Boss distortion box comes close , price ... ) pedal . I bought mine used three years ago works great . It works Metallica , Pantera type sound . You also get good rock sounds gain turned eq . adjusted . Its great pedal , sound really crunchy , I got vyper sometime I use If I want crunchy style , amp I got really good distortion styles , I use heavy metal config pedal , I recomend anyone ... introduce noise , I run stock battery , still works , make guitar sound like Metallica Megadeth , course also depends lot things , like pickups , amp , etc ... , I also old little peavey practice amp , blows away distortion less noise gives new Boss website , I heard I thought sound going similar equipment used , sound really really close . regards . forgive ... U.S BY FAR best distortion pedal . No doubt . Several friends use pedal , love . I also see many popular bands using distortion pedal . It 's great medal . It nice punch along great & # 34 ; cut & # 34 ; 're palm mutes n't blend like pedals . There several knobs offering seemingly unlimited combinations . AMAZING First I want say I love tube amp distortion . tubes meant . I run Randall hybrid amp destroys solid state I 've used heard . For recording I use Peavey 5150 sweet . Tubes guitar meant I started playing band required dirty tone I felt like could achieved pedal . There absolutely nothing wrong using distortion pedals , I used DOD death metal years I first started playing . However , downside . Go cheap get piece crap makes rig sound like old AM radio , want something sounds pro quality going shell least $ 250 . Quality . pedals budget chose MT-2 I know Boss makes quality product pedal guitarist using . It gives variety sounds . It set overdriven light distortion sound full blown high gain metal tones . The controls make tweakable I gotten load nice sounds . Read included book , look MP3s videos online check guitarists ' settings . It help tame pedal want . Perfect pedal wanting spend whole lot . There also mods buy install pedal buy preinstalled certain dealers open even shaping make useful.I 've seen lot complaints pedal sounding like nothing fuzz . I must say learn shape sound , spend time dialing rig . Within 10 minutes I pleased MT-2 . I used overdrive channel push harder got really thick , heavy distortion good response.I say MT-2 worth investment 're looking big distortion sound little pedal . Surely something guitarists consider adding board . This great pedal I picked used , cheaply used market . I actually use acoustic electric guitar get little distortion bass guitar grit . The 2 EQ pots front panel make versatile , enough use cigar box guitar pedal preserve bass signal still EQ 'd saturated distortion . The reviews speak pedal sites one see popular . I also Boss Distortion pedals . Like people , I DS-1 MD-2 cheap effective . I HM-2 Heavy Metal 2 traditional metal sound I actually think pedal versatile IMO different guitars may want strictly metal tone.I also older 80 's HM-2 Heavy Metal run circles around metal zone classic thrash speed metal tones almost heavy distortion pedal I could never part , overall like pedal , top older legendary Boss pedals . 
593	I 've used FX600 couple years . I 've got pedal board , several pedals , I take one pedal , ( I often , I travel lite ) , pedal I take . Not I get full selection effects , pedal doubles DI unit , solving input issues problem sound systems I 've played thru . That 's probably unintended benefit , I find valuable feature , gives confidence play thru system . FYI , buddy 's Digitech multi-effect pedal actually introduces hum systems , ( FX600 ) helped get cleaner sound . While unit tone adjustments , also adds ' make guitars sound better ( I know sort vague ) . The side pedal I found , jammed much stuff one pedal , little hard make precise adjustments . But , pedal DOES , 's small price pay . For price , I ca n't see anyone would like pedal . I recommend pedals perfectunder price excellent qualityI like sound product behringer may cheap , create good products , one 's hit miss . although ordered three . This first pedal . For 50 bucks get every effect except distortion . No pedal comes close delivering bang buck . It 's clean , High Fidelity , versatile swiss army knife . This amazing pedal . delay , flanger , phaser , tremolo , pitch shifter . All sound really good completely adjustable . Only downfall use single function one time . For price steal . Behringer Rocks . I got around 32 bucks , pretty much seemed like stealcompared pedals I looking buy , definitely 9v adapter ( - ) polarity.Also know people said little blue light blinding , well , n't kidding . I 've put little paper tape mine well , however n't sticking.It might best effects effect strength , amp built effects , better 're cheap like want effects , decent , although chorus effect seems particularly weak .

595	Bought rosin see I would like . I light hand bow , I like rosin aggressive side . This . Since styles deal trial & error . Jade rosin gives extra bow . It hardly generates dust , gives bow extra grab . The problem effect wears quickly . I use combination Gold . What say ? This rosin seems better cheapo kind I I feel worth extra money . I tried several rosins violin . Of , I especially like Jade . It leaves little rosin dust violin . Yet gives tone quality looking . Very good rosin exactly described . A nice finish rosin specific . No need try mix rosin new bow rosin labeled bow reduce mystery trying figure bow used different temperatures humidity . 
596	I needed nice sounding classical guitar dinner gigs . I went large Guitar store tried several price range couple hundred settled one sweet sound workmanship . For money I n't think beat . Mahogany plywood sides back Cedar top make really nice mellow tone bone nut saddle thrown good measure . Bone make considerable difference I found . All finish excellent . Now sides . Yes frets finished par ends . As leveling seemed OK . So I took time fret board finished frets flush fingerboard rounded sides tops . Cedar scratch nick looking . You make clear plastic pick guards size going material sewing department find clear plastic large rolls . You buy half yard long x 54 '' make enough pick guards last life time couple bucks . It gloss finish nicely . ( Do use old guitars Nitro finish eat finish instantly ) Same goes changing strings . Put masking tape end bridge top prevent strings scratching Cedar top . Overall like one reviewer said guitar hard put . I put Baggs pickup also . Easy installation nice natural sound . It nice big EQ cut side body . I 've playing guitar 40 years . This 1st decent classical guitar . I Gibson Hummingbird Alvarez acoustic well electrics major manufacturers . I like fact truss rod I 've already adjusted improve action . The tone rich inexpensive guitar . The finish pretty I like solid cedar top . It records well sounds good expensive models . The case nice well . So far I 've problems . I bought new strings n't replaced yet . The old strings worn guitar still sounds loud & # 34 ; alive & # 34 ; . I 'm sure new strings also improve already wonderful sound . Just starting ( ) playing guitar ordered Classical . From moment I took box I impressed . The finish really nice sound awesome . Seems stay tune pretty well . For $ 300 ca n't go wrong : - ) This first guitar I 've bought without playing first , I apprehensive . But 's fine guitar . It 's plain look - decoration , sound rich full , least ten years old . I like nut width action perfect playing . The tuners geared low , allows precise tuning . It came strings - best I 've used , good . And I pleasantly surprised gig bag . It 's strong durable , well designed . All , I doubt I could found better quality product low price . We went local GC try different guitars , mostly blind price , looking see liked best . After couple hours , found repeatedly coming back Cordoba C5 . It nice resonant sound , good playability , attractive finish . The room GC classical guitars $ 1200 really n't find guitar liked better . We $ 50 coupon , bought GC , afterwards took local music shop tech look us . He also impressed , especially fact unlike classicals , one truss rod adjustment . It required minor adjustments complete setup . I snagged beauty holiday sale Amazon baby wonderful price . I previously theLucero Classical Guitar Black ( Black ) I completely happy beginner . When got damaged beyond repair , I looked theCordoba 7/8 Size Classical absolutely wonderful I decided I n't really like size , liking Cordoba brand I decided absolutely wonderful guitar price range . The great level decent enough look C5 vibrancy deep tone I surprised hear budget guitar . While n't prettiest guitar , 's means ugly . Even though mass produced lot quality still apparent guitar.The smell guitar also amazing . It n't cheap wood glue smell low-end guitars , nice rich smell wood . Even months , kept , sound great fresh wood smell still present.All praise aside , flawless guitar . My main complaint would action really high something pretty common new guitars , especially lower price range . Not necessarily flaw something aware : cedar guitar , wood soft I recommend wear soft clothing without buttons zippers playing leave small dents back guitar.I enjoy padded gig bag thought nice touch package . It high-quality gig bag lots padding . Inside bag velcro neck rest strap keep guitar place . It also large front packet large enough music books . When I ordered guitar Amazon , guitar shipped inside gig bag inside big box . I issues shipping guitar arrived safely.Overall , I regret purchase I take setup get action lowered , superb guitar I enjoy years . Highly recommended ! 
597	Ernie Ball makes extremely durable products reputable name musician strings affordable last VERY long time someones guitar normal use.You disappointed product.They sound VERY clean bright use product like GHS Fast Fret playing strings last twice long stay clear bright coating wear small amount turn black strings fail clean properly . These Strings sell half price store , worth effort wait order Amazon.The strings came quickly good quality . These great . I ca n't brag enough . I AM however electric gitty player primarily .

Then I went D'Addario strings . I wanted try since $ 5 price sound nice . They n't sound crisp D'Addario strings . They sound mellow . They 80/20 I prefer strings . I ca n't say I love I hate . I probably stick D'Addario since I n't find difference . I bought Ernie Ball strings Amazon I try soon . For price I would buy strings least test see feel . I n't think sound bad , cost much test . enjoy I used Ernie Ball strings Les Paul quite , Slinkys mostly . I recently bought Yamaha FG700S quickly found high E string `` tinny '' tone . I searched net see model , alas I found I decided try different strings see would help . I ordered set Earthwood Lights installed last , difference . First tone much softer E string , second action feels much comfortable strings 1 thru 3 . The strings came guitar Yamaha light strings stiff , especially B string . After hour playing Earthwood strings last night much enjoyable , tonally physically . Not sure last , time tell.Good strings I would recommend .

602	The listing item confusing sure stereo XLR . Stereo XLR meant similar stereo headphones , left right separate unbalanced wires . This cable configured stereo unbalanced XLR stereo unbalanced TRS cable . This item mono balanced XLR stereo unbalanced mic little bit soldering fix connector moving red wire ping # 3 pin # 2 white wire . # 3 ties pin # 1 ground wire . First , reasons I awarded five stars : construction uniformly excellent . Both ends strain reliefs , 1/8 '' perfectly mates plug I insert , XLR end quality purchased specifically transform third channels 50 Watt Personal P.A . something useable . This greatly expands functionality versatility portable PA allowing plug another mic . Since I three units I able significantly enhance entire system simple reason I love 's noise free . In environments I play sources interference cheap cables pick transmit . I problem one , 's another plus.Overall I pleased adapter actually purchased spare case I damage lose primary one . It 's bit pricier others I considered , I feel quality peace mind worth premium . I use cable run extra line microphone podiums zoom H1 . This adapter never failed instrumental capturing quality audio live events . I several love them.I highly recommend adapter visual audio professional . Also check Hosa 's sinlge XLR double XLR splitter . This adapter cable stereo mics work small cameras function , 's construction pretty light weight . That means `` gentle '' using . That 's something none us broadcast production field want worry since gear gets pretty beat up.Second , adapter one foot length cable . This pretty short may reach wherever mic input jack camera . That means would need another short XLR mic cable extend mic aware may work fine work others . I went Sam Ash music found similar adapter cable , heavy duty , longer cable price . It pays shop around ! Well made . Works . However , seem getting little bit noise shotgun mic straight . ( usual expected ) To see Mic , cable , adapter ; Tested going straight Zoom H4 recorder.Seems little noise going adapter cable straight XLR big surprises . Minor clean post . 
603	I bought Ibanez Concert size uke . The body 2 inches wide ( less 2.75 inches stated stand ) . My uke fit well stand . Why ? The twin forks base hold instrument narrow , curve downward stand proper uke . Thus , uke concert size greater . So , ukes n't fit well . They fit , well.I , likely need advice , remove bottom fork , turn upside , reinstall ( tools required ) . Now `` curve '' upward , uke better sits . The fit improved . Not great better . One stand ca n't fit instruments , full size guitar stands hold guitars . This small stand hold ukes.Although neat folds , like video Amazon reviews , heavy size . This lightweight stand . At . Surprisingly heavy , one lugging around day day uke gig bag , trust me.I wish I got Hercules standHercules Mini Stand . All Hercules stuff superb , friend one uke says 's sublime ( I n't , , I present research 's reviews Amazon ) . I Herc stuff , 's ideal , bucks , I could stand instead one . Oh , well , , I got cheap . And got burned it.All , great , tiny stand . One stand fits NOT . Perhaps violin something would better stand , I think general shape less ideal instruments . You may think bend lower forks , 's hard , require vice , see Amazon pictures , lower fork sits two plastic grooves , splay like , 'll change way fits grooves , thus ; work . It 's imperfect design . My take , mileage may vary . Bye bye . At time I bought , $ 16 . Mine arrived broken , gone back . good regardless mine broken . Not upset - stuff happens . It good stand . Light , unstable ( topples easily ) likely candidate broken dropped . The ' stand keep product scratching instrument soft , shiny runner like ' instrument 's neck . So I pick uke I get stand stickiness seprated gravity . every time . Yes , I tried stand even though broken , proved bad choice . Back gone . 5 stars Amazon 's return policy , thouh ! This stand job quite well . The problem I foresee anyone , instructions proper way unfold . It 's difficult problem solve though , patient work . want add seller item went beyond , far customer service . I nothing praise ! This stand useful small tenor uke violin fine . Any bigger , piece holds neck becomes small ( like baby martin guitar ) , etc . Hope helps Just recieved stand . It fits mandolin perfect , It also fits wifes Ukelele -- - So I ordered second one morning . Its made well . Is compact folded . The price awesome.I totaly recomend stand anyone small stringed insterment . Thank much 
604	I needed new microphone cable due son destroying last one decided invest higher quality cable . This GLS Mic cable working well . The build quality appears good much harder son break .

605	Like Gibson products , high-quality polish one would use high-quality guitar . I used Gibson polishes 38 years ... . I bought recently I love . Why ? It & # 34 ; smell & # 34 ; , leaves residue hands , 's & # 34 ; light & # 34 ; yet cleans , shines , polishes guitar beautifully . It leaves protective coating guitar protects finish , also makes ultra-shiny glossy brings rich deep colors . This fantastic stuff . If guitar best product . But else expect US company like Gibson . I suprised effective . This little bottle goes long way . I already polished guitars friend 's guitars I still 1/2 bottle left . If need polish guitar look . This best choice . The cloth comes product high quality polishing cloth idiot thought best package stuck bottle glue button leaves glue stuck cloth . This glue removable expensive using Gone similar glue solution , washing warm soapy water hand rinsing thoroughly clear clean running water soap removed , hanging cloth air dry , preferably outdoors sunshine available . The cloth nice worth time-consuming correct method cleaning , buy product supposed clean polish first place . Somebody better redesign packaging product Gibson cleaner polish first-rate puts high shine guitar surface comes bright , dry hard almost like used high quality paste wax without residue . Very good stuff , packaging convenience factory I assume without customer 's needs . I unsure kind polish get guitar . I would thought pledge would work , little reading I found could bad woods tone resonance . After scoping Amazon I came product , I happy . It makes black guitar shine easy use . It also comes nice polishing cloth ... great deal money . I bought get grime finger prints Les Paul putting eBay sell . Worked great . Did n't harm finish .

607	This nice cable . Made good materials attractive . I needed 10 foot cable Im glad I n't buy one store . When 're starting purchase equipment budget look Plant Waves line cables such.They offer good middle road accessories . Even high end also . Check carry OK equipment . These mic . cables working really well . Highly recommended . I originally purchase cheaper , thinner cable , settled Planet Waves Classic series XLR cable . I wanted myMXL 2010 Multi-pattern Studio quality xlr cable connecting . I also microphone cable connected theYamaha 6 audio works flawlessly . * Sturdy cable . IT thick flexible time . It curls around microphone stand well , . * Good connector heads . At female end ( microphone ) , spring part locks microphone . added peace cable simply feels strong well made . Phantom power data transfer flawless . I highly recommend quality XLR : working great 5 months . Forgot mention nice packaging . It 's friendly nicely packaged . It also lifetime . Not warranty , guarantee ! That speaks volumes quality believe product . What say ? xlr stress want gear last crappy connection somewhere buy decent cables.This one quality ends makes happy investment last years road.So buy decent quality cable like one cheapest ! Happy Black connectors XLR cable n't cost ton . I use short run mixer Line 6 Pod . They work great . Not greatest mic cable , price ca n't beat . Quiet durable The title says best , 's decent basic mic cable . It 's nothing special , like canare mogami , job stress position . cable bit thin ( supple , quality thin high end mic cables recognize ) . priced right @ $ usd . These cables flexible without feeling cheap , solid end connectors . And , produce electrical noise like old ones , I replaced . I suspect cables round long time come , something important making purchasing decision . These mics cords solid construction going , without high dollar cost . 
608	I 've playing guitar 10 years decided take ukulele extra little one pretty decent , especially price point . Not exactly pinnacle quality , good enough learn comes case booklet basic songs chord chart . It n't seem drop tuning enough bad nuisance , I n't picked days need tweaking . I 'm guitar , piano bass player , well private music teacher . I also received formal training build instruments amateur professional musicians.I ordered ukelele strength reviews Amazon , I pleased instrument arrived . I really surprised loud particular instrument size . It 's 19 '' long ( approximately ) nylon strings , really puts strong volume really nice tone . It geared tuners , tuners seem go tune I 've never played ukelele , I able play songs like Brown Girl , Old MacDonald Had , Do You Wan na 1/2 hour using chord book comes book . I drawing guitar-playing , daughter , piano player 11 years old , picked ukelele . In 15 minutes able play Row Row Row Your Boat , instruction booklet comes uke . I see good buy beginners good starter instrument young children might like move guitar concerns though -- mine came couple small dents back ukelele -- nothing major , I could see -- looks like someone hit something . Also , stringed instruments go tune short put new strings . This one would n't stay tune one song I started playing . I yanked strings stretch , kept retuning playing , would still go tune . This improving , I 'm trusting reviews say goes tune `` first '' . I 'm expecting tuning problem disappear strings get stretched windings around tuners tighten slack . [ note : Two days later , 8 hours playing instrument staying tune better better ; I expect problem correct string get stretched ] The little booklet basic chords songs -- Row Row Row Your Boat , Are You , He 's Got Whole World His Hands , Twinkle Twinkle Little Star , Amazing Grace , When Irish . There also blurb famous ukelele player authored pamphlet play Ukelele member Ukelele Association ( ! ) -- ukelele , I 'm happy ukelele , fully expect tuning problem go away use . This impulse buy . After playing guitar many years I thought ukulele would fun addition , I right . This one proved n't spend big bucks nice instrument . It great sound , appears good quality well made , reasonable price . At first n't seem stay tune day , I decided likely due new strings seemed improve months . If beginner looking good quality without spending lot , nice instrument . My first uke I compare , sounds great . I n't know stock strings came loaded sounded fine ! Although I purchased Lanikai LU-21 ukulele time ago , I chance play hundreds hours . Despite , I 've highly impressed quality sound . As reviewers note , nylon strings tendency go tune pretty quickly fret sharp ; however , 's function strings function ukulele . The Lanikai frets well way fretboard , although seems case soprano ukuleles general , tends sound better resonant lowest range . The tuners seem solid four function consistently construction looks pretty solid well . If I going playing gigs , I 'd probably look expensive presumably higher quality instrument ( I probably would purchase without trying first ) , fun , workable recommended instrument . Great ukulele ! Very light nice . Intonation spot looks beautiful too.A perfect soprano ukulele beginner experienced player looking affordable ukulele ! I play stringed instruments , ukulele n't one . But seeing many great uke players , Joe I hankering try ukulele playing . I wanted playable instrument , I n't feel like spending lot money . I 've tried $ 30-40 ukes stores big bad intonation , tone , etc . After reading reviews elsewhere I decided risk purchase.Result ? This surprisingly good instrument less fifty bucks . Sure , n't volume rich tone soprano solid top , delivers good tone , excellent intonation , good playability good price . It may 5-star 's 5-star value.If 're thinking trying ukulele , 're sure want buy expensive instrument right away , I would strongly recommend LU-21 . Even buy better uke , great one keep hand shove hands unsuspecting guests , play ukulele duets ! I bought one used like new I got . The craftsmanship amazing sound quality little ukulele . The build quality , Aquila strings , tuning keys high quality . You sound great one little instruments time . I downloaded Lanikai booklet internet way . It pure fun play one ukuleles.I bought granddaughter would suggest larger model adult larger fingers . Some chords hard form due small size frets . I still stoked playing granddaughter takes one . There seems trend using Ukulele modern music days . A guitar player 20 years I decided give try . This low risk ( cost ) way get feet wet without committing . It takes little getting used small instrument , little neck 4 strings sure blast play . I wont making upgrade time soon sound build quality reasonable price songs I use serve fine . Highly recommend . I n't experience toy instruments , lots experience better quality ones including professional semi professional ones . I 'm ukulele player , one daughter , whose high school ukulele club features players variety instruments compare one to.I found one made well enough plays well . The frets properly aligned , instrument stays tune . Notes played alternate frets tune well I would expect relative . The tuning issues others mentioned relative break periods different would expect violins guitars , perfectly plays well , I disappointed workmanship . Since I see similar comments others , perhaps mine representative . But workmanship somewhere closer level lower quality instruments I 've seen types.The finishing quality line price range , approach reviewers led believe . The wood properly finished neck meets body , clear sanding marks wrong direction . It looks finished hurry somebody intention quality less important issue grain . Normally , instrument makers try line grain direction body . On mine , grain slant , giving impression neck slightly bent . It 's optical , sign higher quality instrument workmanship issues cosmetic , I 'm still quite satisfied way instrument plays . The finishing issues visible played , tonal quality I 'd expect instrument small resonating chamber . Perhaps better sounding soprano models , price point 's I expect . If disappointed want something better , expect pay least double . 
609	I use 2 stereo mic , works great , nice sound , ears much different SM-57 fraction price . It 's audio professionals mic good enough ! Too noisy hand held vocals , put mic stand instead . Works well friend 's condenser mic cost three times much . Great mic price . I 've used ES-57 ES-58 several years . They fantastic mic , great quality construction . I love hefty . I 've got 6 plan buy needed . I would probably suggest higher end studio recording I set live sound outdoors work great . I several brands ( expensive ) I always come back GLS . This equivalent Shure SM-57 except quarter price . The quality almost terms recording pretty much well . There allow natural sound SM57 I believe thus better product ! This microphone pics instruments quite bit better SM57s . It 's quite bit stronger microphone also . I really impressed mic ! The thing I 'd like see would come cover ( bag ) like Shure mics . Other , save heck lot money even better quality ! Thanks lot ! I read many reviews SM57 clone microphones see anything job . It seems everyone given opinion subject seemed agree one microphone . The GLS . ( Same SM ) . I give shot . I run sound local bands I use SM 's take abuse still sound great . Only time tell mic able take amount abuse far I really like . The frequency band identical SM57 others said . A little less bass n't mean thin sound - certainly . I get sound SM I EQ slightly I like natural sound anyway . Also , signal bit hotter I really like tone vocals instruments . Value money ca n't beat . If budget , get one ... . A great instrument mic using bass cabinet , instead line real live ES-57 equal Shure SM-57 $ 60.00 less . Quality really outstanding price . Sound clear crisp . I get lot feedback , I guess microphone . This mic excellent , 's pretty much straight clone sm-57 money mic 's even close one . Also price orange speaker 's website $ 29 $ 25 store I 'm entirely sure 's $ 50 Amazon . I would n't surprised big time professional musician might able tell difference Shure , amateur purposes bad bone good . I bought replace Blue Snowball I 've reached point I require something sounds little bit professional I using . Before I begin review , I 'd like mention I use Behringer 302USB Premium 5-Input Mixer XENYX Preamp ( copy paste Amazon 's search find ) . So review based thing plugged thing.Okay , pros cons.Pros1 . My voice sounds great thing . Before I using Snowball podcast partner told sounded like I & # 34 ; chamber & # 34 ; . With , voice strong clear ... even little bassy nice I n't naturally bassy voice . I 'm extremely satisfied well thing makes sound . It better USB mics like Blue Snowball . Worlds . It 's heft , heavy , feels well made . This might device I . It 's heavy good way . The materials feel high quality . This feels like professional . It comes mic stand holder thing . Never say free stuff.Cons1 . The thing I think n't come cable . You 'll need buy XLR cable . It 's bad enough deduct star.There people comparing Shure SM57 microphones . Here 's thing , I amateur . Before I owned mic , I using Blue Snowball , laptop webcam mic . So I authority . All I tell thing sounds freaking amazing . My podcast co-host immediately noticed difference could n't tell enough much better I sounded 's Skype call ( podcast using Skype ) . So 're looking vocal/podcast mic , great , cheap option . Are better options ? Sure , price . Not even close . Recommended wholeheartedly . I expected Shure SM57 knock-off disappoint . I . For 30 bucks thing job . There bit handling noise enough complain . I put windscreen eliminate pops wind noise . I recommend mic vocals . I 've fun . As far longevity durability , time tell . I GLS ES-58 happy I need mic guitar cab I went could n't happier . These mics solid I ca n't tell real deal . I done side side comparison real 57 knock 57 mics unless kind sonic freak I doubt would notice difference . I purchase three 57 mics rest bands intruments . Loved Mic I hooked , sounds great price ca n't go wrong . Wish on/off switch get around . Great instruments vocals well . Was delivered time well , amazon best best vendor . I 've using Shure microphones live studio nearly thirty years I honestly say I hear audible differences genuine Shure SM-57 GLS Audio n't based scientific data , 's based mic Shure 57 tube amp volume distance going mic pre . I made sure I marked exact location mic little masking tape amp 's speaker grill . I recorded 30 seconds simple chord progression first Shure mic , one . When play back either studio monitors good Bose headphones hear audible difference two . If examine tracks waveform editor I 'm sure 'll see visual differences ( also two different performances ) , ears really hear nothing audibly different . Some may disagree , I 'm mic built solidly weighs Shure intents purposes looks almost identical inside good Shure ? I n't know , I think - others may . I know buy three price one Shure 57 though . I 'd highly recommend guitar cabinets , snare drums , toms sure , maybe vocals pinch particular type voice.A no-brainer far I tell . I Shure version mic ( naming names haha ) mic good ! Actually , I take back , 's better shure mic one n't overpriced ! ! Wow , I never buy another SM-57 . I ca n't believe I 'm writing , 's ture . I psyched I found microphone , 's seriously , sound quality never disappointed . In fact , might head , I prefer use micing guitar amp . But everyone else talked sound , I want talk build quality.It 's solid , weight , plastic top feels exactly right : far , n't come loose way SM-57s . If I handed SM-57 n't know better , 'd probably guess ES-57 bit higher-end . I continually look ca n't believe I paid $ 30 one . Nah , get bunch ! SM-57s $ 60 turn two . Magic ! This great value ! I able record good quality guitar tracks using . It n't sound exactly like sm57 , get close . You amp compensate difference . This mic solid construction looks feels like SM57 . I liked live vocals vs old mic I seemed give everyone small shocks ( probably cost way day ) . I originally bought check hype say I likely get needed instead buying SM57s . I recorded yet , I heard online , I think fine . This Mike awesome value could pay twice three times frequency response excellent service super fast I would 've problem buying folks future 
610	This highly amp price point . I get great clean , blues heavy metal tones . Like Line 6 products , features highly apparent . For example , extra gain , hold tuner button turn gain knob past 12 o'clock boost . This may sound like much , really CAN change tone , even clean channels . On crunch channel , example , gives guitar almost fuzz face overdriven sound ( Strat ) . On metal channels , really drives gain top.The tuner seems work well enough included effects OK . I decided go cheaper pedal ( still 1/3 price amp ! ) really works well home practice situations . One switch clean metal , clean blues without much trouble ( one click ) . I think pedals expensive personally , well constructed solid steel seem durable . The cable simple cat 5 network cable I believe , replacing trivial.I live apartment little 15-watt amp WAY loud turn past 1 2 . It great tone balance ( ears ) . It corner protectors even amp n't ! Overall I recommend amp anyone looking cheaper home practice amp . After registering amp online ( mail ) access backing tunes , either drums drums . You able select different genres Rock , Blues , Country , . Along great feature , also take free lessons , beginner advanced . You even get custom settings , giving sound great bands Green Day , The Beatles , Led many . Along lessons , tabs , ability loop Jam Track , Spider Online adds even I awesome amp ! ! If 're still hesitant buying Spider amp , buy . I personally guarantee satisfaction ... BUY IT ! ! ( seriously , buying ? ? ) Never 15 watts sounded loud clear . Never think 8 inch speaker . Just enough effects leave pedals home practices.Light weight easy carry . I bought amp Epiphone Goth Studio guitar , I 've got weekend I 'm satisfied product . I 'm proffessional amp really good price pay comes many functions , complete add-ons th webpage . Solid , nice sound , good quality make anyone happy , except couple months I want say ... great product terms sound , great terms small building Blues style , use clean good reverb crunch get amazing blues sounds.My con 's I reduced 4 stars fact one corners protectors came broken also , working . Better quality control avoid things happen . I wrote Line6 I got useless answers . amp really shines distortion modes , I ; really care clean sounds metal tones good I 've ever heard low cost amp . I wish I found amp sooner . It blows brands away I 've amp week I 'm still finding cool things . The first thing I went presets . I n't like clean channel , ( n't really clean ) I quickly found set like wanted ( press clean button turn preset effects 0 hold clean button three seconds lights blink 's really clean . You also channels ! set every thing like want hold button channel want . n't worry , always reset back factory settings start . It 's small amp 's bigger I thought would . But sound comes 8 & # 34 ; speaker BIG ! . I playing 30 years , I know I could use amp small club without running PA . If need little volume , line run PA volume want . I would buy amp mine stolen . Makes great practice room amp . You take without pedals still effects would need . For price 's bargain ! A good modeling amp . My complaint I n't like clean sounds liking . Other awesome amp . I bought amp back didnt know much amps . If want metal sound practice , hard get better amp one bill . But hybrid amps ( Vibro Champ ) going much , get better sounds settings . I selling mine ordered Super Champ used new condition two half bills . This Line 6 amp flat sterile sound isnt warm sounding . From tube amps , even pay price . A good tube amp last long time hold value well , . Like said , first amp one bill , Line 6 isnt bad . Maybe day able afford Princeton Reverb ? I 've amp 2 months love . It 's choice effects thorough beginner like . I n't greatest guitar ever sounds amp clean crisp . The choice effects nice reverb , tremolo , delay , among effects . The jack also great addition . The amp looks nice chrome knobs simple use . This little amp awesome , I Peavey back day , little guy could , n't get loud , least wo n't worry someone calling cops loud , gets loud enough , careful . 
611	I love lot bold type acoustic ... . chicken ' much fun I still experimenting . AS digitech pedals , I seem love ease operation . gain pedal without feedback incredible ... . The digitech main squeeze okay compression pedal . Do I use ? yes . However , I would likely trade MXR I opportunity . It n't sound bad per se ' hiss . It also boosts signal ( noticeable volume increase ) . While may like , I want compressor little subtle provide added sustain . As soon I got pedal I put board noticed high end hum . I 2 Behringer pedals board lot people say bad noisy pedals , pedal board silent till I put pedal . I 've days , cons way pros . Maybe I purchase noise reducer help clean bit . Once I get around playing I write another review . wise , unit decent I noise ... I tolerated wound pulling cleaner compressor ... I stayed clear using pedals playing ( 40 years ) , installing Sustainer kit getting results guys : Too much sustain adjacent strings makes whole experience joke , I decided go ahead try compressor happy results . I play mostly clean ( jazz , blues , rock ) unit gives least twice sustain I would normally get without pedals . Good transparent compressor low noise operation , tough construction , although best sounds good , depends situation , sustain good .

614	I installed Ragin ' Cajun Fender Super Champ X2 . I immediately noticed difference quality , fullness volume amp . It turned amp amp capable used small gigs . An excellent speaker I would highly recommed . I installed Ragin ' Cajun Fender Super Champ XD . I read reviews people saying speaker turned Super Champ monster man right ! I immediately noticed difference warmth , articulation , fullness sound ! The cleans warm ... clean , distortion articulate fits needs nicely . I trying play Tool 's `` '' beginning part never sounded right . I always thought I something wrong muddy souned . Tried Ragin Cajun sounds perfect ! I would highly recommend speaker anyone owns Fender Super Camp XD needs 10 inch speaker.Two items note : 1 ) A people said bass heavy speaker I agree . While slightly darker stock speaker , screaming range . A quick turn Treble knob 4 6 cleaned darkness . 2 ) Do n't forget , first time install speaker worst sound . All speakers need broken hit sweet spot . With said , thing sounds amazing directly install . Buy , wo n't regret ! Fabulous clean tone , great distortion sound running solid-state amp pedals . The characteristic Strat sound guitar apparent . ton , cool logo , made USA . What could ask ? I installed Super Champ x2 . As others pointed 'll turn treble installing . That 's 's designed making solos stand . , adding punch . If 're lead guitarist , speaker make guitar sing.However , mostly play rhythm , I 'd stick stock speaker.I want put two 4x10 Blues DeVille increase range make solos sing , letting stock speakers give bottom .

In cases , good soft gig bag padding protect instrument light bumps bangs , costs 1/4 price hard case.I bought two different variations Fender Gig Bag , I believe one pictured one Fender Medium guitar picks zipper handles , cool touch . The case fits Strat guitars ( guitars similar size ) snugly . There ton padding , might think pictures , especially top . The pocket fine , variety adjustable handles straps .

624	I love capo . Let tell capo journey I 've used every brand searching one . First , I always owned old Dunlop Toggle Action capo old tech , know , 's bundle synthetic cotton fiber , kind one used use 1980 . I go back first Planet Waves black capo broke . Do n't buy live damp climate like CA . Each one I bought broke , one broke within week , winter rainy days . So I loved capos , perfect , I done breaking , I figured I 'd try others instead despite love Planet Waves design ( I n't know silver aluminum one yet ) . Well , I hated one I tried . Kyser , carpal and/or small handed , know I mean , n't want capo involves squeezing really hard hands pain n't want play guitar . I really hate Kysers ( I know folks love squeeze use , 's fine , different strokes right ) . Then I tried Schub , kidding . thing ridiculous , pops , wiggles , tricky , I hate . Now , I know many folks Schub fans give drive , I 'm saying n't great love . If love Schub , love unconditionally , I respect , I 'm saying design many folks like . There models fail similarly 2 , make squeeze hard hurt like sensitive hands , like G7 , I fall love maybe 5th squeezing hurt hand unsqueezing apart put back . painful . Sorry softie crybaby , carpal , know I mean , want go easy hands arms , . The thing I 've always hated Kysers ( may smaller involved ) gets way chording capo lot harder . That 's dumb . Kyser either accept challenge n't mind claim n't , know I 'm talking . Ok , broken Planet Waves thermoplastic capos , I turned next Dunlop 's turnscrew models . I liked , similar PW design , screw location awkward use , turning screws lot harder fingers ( got ripped fingertips show ) . So , I turned back search better Planet Waves model . This , right . The silver one excellent , 's made aluminum , thermoplastic . I bought one lasted almost 3 years without single problem . By , contrast , I would run 3 4 thermoplastic ones . I want say performing public venue , never use thermoplastic ones , thermoplastic ones dramatically burst flew across room , could easily `` poke someone 's eyes '' . Not kidding , n't use public situations . Back excellent aluminum silver capo . I love , n't break , , great thermoplastic model features make best capo ever ( especially us sensitive folks carpal small handed people etc ) . The great features are:1 . Ease use easy fitting perfect , best capos . This capo fits easily . Simply put fretboard location screw perfect -- never move guitar hand couple inches , unlike screwtops capos , 's need moving around , adjusting guitar , falling due balance issues chasing falling guitar , sheesh none nonsense . You put 've engineered brilliantly easily get , move fret fret , put want , screw great ease ! Wow , best ever category . Ease use tops , ever ! 2 . It never hurt , helps . It weighs nothing , easy carry , slip onto peg area , light . I still ca n't believe light . It 's supposed , capos n't . No issues tune , screw level tightness desire , wrestling around like capos . The screw easy location , screw nicely made n't hurt fingers screw unscrew , 's breeze . No problems size , 's small , n't get way fretboard . You wo n't hand yoga order play capo 'd songs , FLAT ( I know , concept ! ) . A capo always flat way play chords , pretzeled twister instead chords . Now , I play capo 'd songs time capo , much fun musically , whole new magical experience . The truth I 've found good equipment matters music making ( I never played acoustic guitar well much I got first Applause guitar great action . I Yamaha I love ( since Applause necks break ) , guitars taught good equipment 's easy use ( case guitars , great action imperative . In case capos , ease use pain produced imperative , opens world capo use , magic music theory . ) If love brands , n't , I know 's perfect , I 'm happy works perfectly , best one , shine music I enjoy listening play . But sensitive small hands carpal know I 'm talking , wo n't settle torture Kysers , got ta kidding . I bought every capo imaginable ( need garage sale get rid pile ) ended I using old toggle type instead I found aluminum Silver Planet Waves Capo . Planet Waves made perfect capo , issues , easy fun playing capo 'd songs . Again , buy Silver model , when/if get silver , guaranteed get aluminum , thermoplastic . Capos funny thing , work great many n't great . My capos include , , , Kyser . This fast easy capo use , tension adjustment fast easy . If need around capo six string guitar , . Not good G7th line Capo half price . I bought 12 string Jumbo acoustic guitar I thrilled way sounded . So I probably using electrics . But like I said good price . The capo design makes quick easy install fretboard . What I like padded arm thin keeps way playing . Highly recommended ! I 've 2 weeks capo simple works great . It feels like plastic made aluminum holds well . If know much pressure apply frets , capo works great though I always bit fine tuning , expected first place . I love cheap compared capos , yes 's made plastic . 
625	These guitar strings nothing special , based amazingly low price nobody expect . They work well , look good , fairly durable low price . I remodeling old Behringer I wanted fresh , shiny set new strings . For playing , sound pretty good . Best part , opinion , 're made America , well majority Fender products . If want spend extra money , I 'd stil recommend Ernie Ball , perhaps simply higher quality pair Fender strings . You get pay . As far shipping , Musician 's Friend great job getting order quickly . I 'll ordering Musician 's Friend . I bought guitar used strings provided . After month using strings I decided replace since I trouble keeping low E string tune . I put strings compared & # 34 ; default & # 34 ; strings , almost silky softer 'm guessing guitar came steel strings nickel . The sound much nicer ears well . They relatively inexpensive made great choice replacing strings new guitar . I tried nearly every kind popular strings . I 've used ernie ball , fender , prs , kinds . When I bought first real fender guitar came fender strings I loved . So I needed strings I got fenders . I happy say I prolly never buy different kind strings . They clean sounding pure vibe . GREAT strings . These Gold standard Strat type electrics , Fender . I put 150 's Strats regardless brand . They durable enough take pounding sound great . I tend play Strats bit rougher Gibson 's acoustics well tested house . I get bit carried away amp volume tend bend strings bit . I continue using Strats I find something better I n't yet . I use strings types guitars see reviews well.These bullet proof . They take pounding last long could expect ! ! ! There something special strings . They ring bright beautiful . I absolutely love fenders . I honestly n't use fenders tele . They 're gorgeous sounding , especially new . Do n't know I love sound strings , placebo ? Maybe IMO best sounding strings I 've played . I use Fender strings I used many brands well . I like Nickel reduced fret wear sound . I change strings monthly particular guitar used quite bit I go 2 3 weeks hard playing.I started using Fender strings Stratocaster bullet strings specifically designed fit tremolo bridge strat . They sounded great . I use telecaster 10 ( factory spec ) real nice too.I recommend using stainless steel strings guitars stainless strings like using stainless steel files frets . I seen real damage cases relatively short time period . Stick nickel glad ! We funny bunch : 'll change pots caps pups axes amps day long , spend fortune . But sometimes could make tonal difference spending five bucks ! Case point : pure nickel strings . Time ... whiz , time good guitar tone ruled . ? Nope . These things sound better , better mean warmer subtle feel fingers convey milliseconds . If 're used wrapped strings , like play blues classic rock pretty much anything metal , might need make rig sound whole lot sweeter smoother musical general . Especially use tubes.Tubes pure nickel like Gilmour Strats Angus SGs . They fit.I 'm nuts Fender acoustic strings , I like normal electric strings fine , though Ernie Ball Slinkies many years . But Fender pure nickels nice , , 're real deal . Most pure nickels run nearer ten , sound pretty much , I n't seem break many 'em neither . If 're used mixed alloy , pure nickels might seem little `` dull '' , wait bit 'll find harmonics still alloys faded . Plus feel smoother nicer fingertips . Try set see I mean . It 's subtle 's main reason I love playing VOLUME ! I turned modded Hot Rod Deluxe levels ( neighbors getting used ) , louder drummer good chunk , I got : less squealing , warmer tone far , full chords , triads double stops felt sounded smoother harmonic warmth alloy string I 've ever used . I think 's electrical pure nickel good pups tubes simply sublime . Check BB 's tone legendary Live At The Regal hear I mean . That 's stuff.So , n't tried pure nickels , spend buck two ( maybe less ! ) normally give nickels try . You might find 're convert within seconds . I know ears sure love things really cranked ; Zep Jimi riffs sound feel much right pure nickel . And digging Rush licks like night day . The bluesy stuff begs pure bargain less five bucks . You want Fender sound like one , using strings helps . I MIA Telecaster stay tune good sustain . I 'm happy . I like 9-42 Pure Nickel strings ... nice tone , work well Stratocaster Fender locking tuners ... great combo , even ghost bends , slides , pounding Drop D Open G tuning . 
626	I use mandolin , easy use trick , first thing long end eyelets ( reviewers fear scratch neck instruments ) , short end ( designed prevent said scratches ) . To use place capo strings short end facing , use left thumb hold place short end dangling thumb , next loop long end back neck using right hand pull neck toward thumb , trap short end long end prevent long ends eyelets touching instruments neck , rotate left thumb way buckle strap place set.I prefer capo 2 I tiny , barely bigger first two joints pinkie , yet job designed , small size means I toss mandos storage box forget till I need it.The downside elastic eventually stretch longer work , 5 bucks ca n't everything . It 's small . It 's fabric stretchy capo , old type , 's quite difficult stretch make stay . It 's made end stretch fabric connect hold capo , end n't long I n't trust stay playing long . I 'll keep spare , case , anyway . 's hard keep loose end holes since holes metal scratch neck instrument . otherwise 's good idea . Old tech bungee type capo . Inexpensive works well . You remember banjos n't lot tension neck really n't require vice get job done . Works well Mandolin 's . I needed small capo mandolin I purchased little guy . Works great , though I put 1st fret move I need . Do n't know I expected cheap price , product 's quality line price . Also , fit ukulele 's fretboard tight , making hard put remove .

I Line 6 II Floorboard takes care needs effects ( gigs studio ) including wah pedal sometimes I take smaller Marshall jam friends . I needed something low-priced would job situation I ended something lot I bought pedal . I got yesterday playing hours . I really like price , I n't see beat . It seems well-made I think , I hope , hold well normal care . I 've ever used Line 6 Floorboard , old Crybaby wah effects I 'll tell I really like pedal . It 's spring-loaded comes back . It says remove spring want feature combined fact turns step turns step , allows much creative playing use wah . I n't even think whether 's allows use wah ways I never could like half riff certain parts passage . I also like really step without worrying switching like wahs . The reason I n't give five stars 's sort semi-annoying hiccup sound sometimes . It seems happen last part sweep pedal coming , I avoid I try . I n't know 's mine something inherent pedal . I 'll update review I ever figure . I got today n't spent much time yet . It sounded OK I like features . I especially like step hard toe engage pedal . As soon press 's . Lots adjustments I 'll tweaking find sound , seems like 's going OK . It 's lot different crybaby little learning curve . For money It 's great pedal . good pedal price I bought behringer pedals work well buying My 1st Wah . This going take getting used regarding switches , knobs , buttons . I working getting nice way sound I 've come across somewhat . It sounds funky strumming simple cords . One thing I would like would detailed instructions functions offers . Behringer never documentation oriented . I 've playing lot since I got last week . It really versatile well noiseless . I 've mostly used default settings.I n't time tweak much I 'd like I say quite easy get different tones . Really impressed wah ! I bought Hell babe 10 years ago , first wah pedal pedal board ever since , one . never major problem , boost knob fell couple years ago plastic kick lot years big deal . Its crybaby im glad , sound tried get vintage crybaby could n't matter much tweaked . I actually run crybaby hell babe pedal board find using hell babe way , especially since auto spring back . really makes solos rip . buy , ball . My complaint spring loud audible playing acoustic gigs acoustic guitar sucks whatever ... .. 
634	Honestly , strings great . They sound great ( relatively ) inexpensive bass strings . I love , I buy next time I change well . Highly recommended . I like strings . I 'll changing soon though , really light sound I like smooth low sound . I like strings come code allows determine whether authentic counterfeit . Will buy . My go-to string brand stringed instrument . Punchy round-wound tone , responsive tone controls muted sound required . I bought bass site , much I love thing , I 'm expert . I popped E string over-tightening I setting . I replaced factory strings . I 'm told sounds better . I think well , I ca n't quite quantify . I usually use Pro Steels ( D'Addario ) sound fit nicely Squire Fender P Bass . Amazon seems great prices 's nice delivered . These super strings . They last last last , give great sound . Easy put tune . I 'm normally acoustic guitar player recently acquired first electric ever . It used , strings dismal sounding , I bought D'Addario . They hold pitch beautifully . My complaint guitar technique , strings . Having used heavier strings forever acoustic guitars , recommended lighter gauge recommended electric n't like `` heavy-handed '' approach pressing strings . As result , highly bendable lighter strings become sharp near nut I relax enjoy playing light touch . It take getting used -- else I 'll simply move heavier strings leave lighter ones lead guitarists know . All said , strings pure joy play . I 've used D'Addario 's many different Guitar 's opinion I honestly give Ya They best . In Studio Stage , They stay tune work well pickup You using . I put My Wife 's Bass cause She still learning Fender Squire sounds almost good Precision Fender Bass . They stay true note She get know pitch note sound like every time ... ... I trying find perfect gauge . Tried ( light high ) ( deep , good popping ) , right middle . Perfect . solid favorite around house . fat deep , snappy needed . definitly pay , may want specific tone , safe bet always sound good Best articulate bass string money . I one first versions Fender Precision bass 90s . I started use lighter strings keep neck getting . They sound great stay tune . Sound like Rotosounds ... Roger , Geddy Lee , Chris Squier . Nice bright deep sound fingers pick . I slap style player I ca n't comment . I set action fairly high keep every thing clean possible . Try , 'll like bass guitar neck happy . ... strings I use D'Addario strings acoustic electric guitars well great . They really nice sound n't cost arm leg ... I keep going back forth DR High Beams . My teacher really likes High Beams , half price , tone great , surely new set going & # 34 ; oomph & # 34 ; set High Beams I keep little long cost . . . Recommended . Through Ampeg bass amp , low E string gets distorted push bass control 7 , upper 3 strings sound kind plain . So pretty great strings . Not much say . The price really good . About ten dollars set really good . 
635	This device works . Here 's . You plug electric bass pedal 's instrument input plug second standard instrument cable pedal 's high impedance output jack plug one bass amp . You also connect low impedance microphone preamp via 200 Ohm low impedance XLR jack . You use high-impedance output XLR output use simultaneously . When `` footswitch '' functions transparently tonal modification like direct box . When `` footswitch '' LED light activates tonal boost tube emulation functions . I put `` footswitch '' quotes I use fingers push , leave time personal purpose . When insert plug instrument input jack unit powers , running battery sure unplug input actually using functional comments . It runs 9 volt batteries 9-volt power supply . I used batteries switched ac adapter . Battery life n't super satisfactory . Still using lot , I suggest using AC adapter . When battery starts going sounds awful , could put bypass mode finish set . Also `` footswitch '' LED lit , thing functions straight XLR direct box anything plug . You could patch output acoustic electric guitar output electric guitar pedal board use feed mixer recording direct handy feature home recording hobbyist ! The amp emulation tone controls wrong anything electric bass , use direct box tone/emulation circuit anything except bass.The controls rotary knobs except switch slide switch . The controls left right , top row second row : DRIVE , TREBLE , BASS , LEVEL , PRESENCE , GROUND LIFT SWITCH control one time understand important logically placed . The DRIVE knob adjusts amount gain similar cranking input stage control tube preamp get something like tonal thickness ( edge ) overdriven tube tone . Basically part circuit injects variable harmonics pleasing distortion purpose . There pad switch extra active input jack pedal active bass turn drive knob much get tone want . The TREBLE knob + - 12db boost cut upper frequency tones . The BASS knob + - 12db boost cut lower frequencies . 12 o'clock flat ( zero db boost cut ) treble bass knobs . The LEVEL knob master volume control control output volume tonal coloration . The PRESENCE knob boosts upper frequency range harmonic content attack tone . The Presence knob n't midrange control , boost upper mids . The GROUND LIFT switch effects XLR output jack left `` OFF '' unless hook hum . Then turn `` ON '' might help eliminate hum issue . However better safety standpoint remedy eliminating electrical ground loop conflict causing hum . The knob controls amount tube emulation pedal 's output way left none , 12 o'clock 50 % way clockwise 100 % .CONS : Very little bass gear , anything else , `` PERFECT '' days . Behringer gear build issues general across product line using Chinese parts labor keep costs . Designed Germany built China means get Chinese components Chinese build quality specs look pretty enticing . For example first battery change battery clip self-destructed part clip 's terminal stayed stuck battery pulled completely clip . This Duracell battery , standard pedal batteries . Went Radio Shack got replacement battery clips fixed new clip soldering wires new clip stripped wires cut away old clip taping solder joint . I 've never used stompbox switch looks like break lean hard . Construction plastic . The casing durable based previous experience plastic switches stomp boxes I know use size foot . The Treble Presence knobs mine generate hiss noise set high may noticeable vintage type bass amp tweeter becomes using full range amp cabinet using XLR output recording PA feed . Basically I set Treble Presence point I hear hiss start , back goes completely away functional limit . issue bypass mode preamp . The jacks , XLR , plastic box jacks soldered direct circuit board pedal , These type jacks noted causing problems , especially rough use take easy last long time . This unit lacks dedicated knob Presence knob seem boost upper mids treble simultaneously . Some people use pedal stage-tool use solo `` scoop '' switch slap & tap solos presence , bass treble boost basically need solo switch : First foremost price almost good true consider price anything else similar features , keep mind durability issues gentle last indefinitely . This n't Tech 21 NYC Bass Driver means , works similar fashion one . I Tech 21 Bass Driver Deluxe I use gigs . The Tech 21 sounds better costs eight times Behringer cost . I use Behringer home save wear pedal board home . If I n't Tech 21 unit I might take unit gigs , probably last way longer way I keep setup home time . I especially like unit used small rehearsal/practice type combos . Many smaller combos passive type tone circuits basically flat tone cranked wide open device really makes little amps sound serious . Part beauty active bass tone boost capability n't get passive bass passive bass make sound like active bass treble bass boost front amp . It also useful boosting signal front longer cable run backline , say anything 18 feet . For recording XLR direct useful XLR direct also used feed PA gig amp n't XLR direct I use device : I bass guitar plugged input use XLR output connect microphone mixer . The output microphone mixer Beach Santa soundcard XP computer . I record using computer 's recording software , practice solo I play along recorded music using headphones . With headphones I play loud I want anytime I want without disturbing anyone . Most computer speakers electric bass , I recommend headphones instead typical desktop computer speakers . You buy better computer speakers capable , cost actually decent bass guitar practice combo amp . Quality headphones cost far less quality powered computer speakers bass guitar owned pedal 4 years knowing I know , I would buy . I would strongly recommend home recording/practice tool recommendation stage tool strong . For home use fine . You use gigs I 'd saving `` gig bones '' buy something durable better performance . I 'm primarily guitarist , I keep inexpensive SX bass around I 'm self-recording whatnot . Since n't primary instrument I n't play bass live ( well , yet ) , never made sense invest bass amp . I bought liven tone recording , hope removing sterility bass plugged directly firewire interface . It job ; makes sound warmer , 've homework thing , know think . Behringer 's build quality dubious sometimes , overall stuff produces sounds satisfy anyone n't picky audiophile . This box exception . I 've never personally played SansAmp , I would hazard guess KNOW 's want , wo n't satisfy . If want something LIKE SansAmp could lot worse venture bucks little ears , sounds quite good . Get fills need 're broke . Knocked star Behringer 's usual build quality , although mine n't broken gentle use yet . I used , I behringer rack mount rarely gets used . Also , every single bass guitar amplifier stage I soundman balanced direct output right xlr connector right amp . I still use practice home . I Acoustic MKII 100 watt bass amp 15 inch speaker . My bass SX jazz bass . I always loved tone Acoustic amp , . After I plugged little bad boy , brought amp life ! Now , I live without . This army knife bass preamps . Every bass player one . You dial tons different tones gives amp tube-like sound . For 29 bones , simply beat ! Spend extra 10 bucks get Behringer 9V power supply , n't worry batteries . If bass player , buy ! ! ! It 's decent unit , stopped working completely 6 months . Tried everything I could , 's gone . I would recommend pedal . I numerous Behringer products never issue them.This item well worth money sound awsome , want . Who cares plastic.I Behringer X V-Amp Guitar Multi Effects Pedal I first plugged , quality amp models blew guy said received one stripped screws even think stepping pedal ... , sounds like sent returned product someone messed . You bright enough return ask replacement . Second , musical instruments . You n't supposed stomp like trying crush grind stage ... ever play . The term ' box n't supposed taken literally . It simply means push pedal button foot . , word stomp . What say ... less $ 30 ( shipping ) , 's steal ! I looking VERY inexpensive version popular Sansamp , . Decent SVT , flip top `` fat tube '' tone , nice quiet DI . I go DI house , output old Seymour Duncan cab . Great tone ! ! I 'm using Class II wall wart ( found `` spare parts '' closet ) vs 9V batteries . With wall wart , DI hum = Great ! Does eat batteries , get power supply . Never use foot switch ; used , I use finger . If broken lost ( would steal ? ) , I 'd buy another heart beat ! Does described really enhances tone . Good tonal variations available . Only negative , 's huge , get little noisy presence increased beyond half . I using bass two single coils makes noise challenge begin . 
636	It decent cable . It job , leaves much desired far structural integrity concerned . The part connector back forth . The switch also loose .

637	I use strings acoustic guitars , except smaller Takamine New Yorker A & L ; ( I use D'Addario custom lights ) . I grown Phosphor Bronze strings perfect balance warm full sound strumming bright tones picking . , brightness retained longer bronze brass alloys I 've tried , Martins Elixirs . These strings quite durable long-lasting . In 10 years I 've playing , I 've never strings break ( I 've broken Martin Elixir strings past ) . The end balls help restringing . I typically get three-pack I restring trio set time . I really ca n't complain individual gauges : .012 , .016 , , , , recommended . I Ernie Ball guy long time . But I getting pissed Ernies kept corroding quickly . So I tried , seem hold better . There coated strings last longer , I n't like spending much strings . And course , sound excellent . Stock ! ! They easier play medium gauge strings came guitar . I beginner although still hurt fingers improvement . They also pretty color , ends strings ( ones go holes installation ) color coded come chart , makes things easy . I 've use strings years . I play often like change strings often . I without breaking bank hold well many practices gigs . They hold tune ( least guitar ) indoors . I 'd highly recommend . My guitar originally came sounded good . I replaced Elixir nanoweb coated strings also sounded good , finish wearing fast . This time I got 3 pack light . The easy put held well tarnishing quickly.But sound problem . It 's terrible . They sound muddy . Crisp tone distinction . I thought light would better route , I 'm sure . I purchased others try . Also , since purchased 3 pack . I may change strings completely see If I dead strings . These strings originally strung Godin Seagull , I absolutely love sound , feel , durability . The one reason I actually needed G string broke I tuning fast . The sound almost identical D'Addario describes , strings great , uplifting sound , hard soft strums . Playing feels great , nothing ordinary either strumming fretboard feel , clean smooth . When replacing , I ran problems , quick easy . I love strings price , definitely stick brand well . These strings D'Addario personal favorite mine . I love EJ16 light gauge size ease use . I think light gauge nice size wo n't hurt fingers , put undue stress guitar . Not , sound great . Not big small ! I plenty volume drive bluegrass . I love color code strings `` ball ends '' . To makes much easier changing strings . You n't worry mixing strings . I 've also problem fit ; unlike brands . Give try . I think 'll satisfied . Only issue break easily . But last long time sound great . Well worth money . Crisp fresh tone long time . These strings I use acoustic/electric . Love sealed bags keep air tight seal . Extra lights . I brought set one strings broke kid size guitar , I also wanted backup strings . I n't tried many different strings . I used strings ( D'addario EXP ) came Takamine GS330S , 's good year+ . strings break , I try one GS330S well . Over , I think D'addario great warm balance tones . After strings set `` stretch '' days playing , stays tune . The strings set 6 months , still playable , sounds okay kid size guitar . I n't think problem strings GS330S . I 'm happy purchase quality strings . These sound great last long time . Plus , 're reasonably priced . Put 'em case n't unprepared . I like squirrels . I play resonator guitars open tuned . These strings hold well tension open & # 34 ; A & # 34 ; tuning . I recently tried multiple brands gauges ( almost every B string snapped / C # ) come back ... Only wish came packs 10 cause I go three sets month ( 3 guitars ) Strings , 're I use acoustic . These custom light strings particular give sound I wanted guitar . Great guitar string reasonable price . I highly recommend acoustic strings , also available light heavy prefer . I like EJ 17 medium string rhythm acoustic guitar . ... . I 'm going back works best , Martin SP custom light . While packaging ( sealed ) set good thing also individual color coding string , I prefer Martins ' , It fine strings , could n't really find difference martin , expected ! regular strings I n't expecting much price admit I 'm pleased tone strings produce straight package . After several hours play 2 tunings , 're spot sound sweet cream butter . Great product highly recommend tried brands strings , brand consistently buy ! smooth use sound superb ! Well made . Enjoyable play . Stay tune well . The sound clear warm Yamaha Martin . Right I experimenting different strings I cant say better others . I personally like sound better Martin I tried personal choice . Let guitar judge . These D'Addario Medium Acoustic Guitar Strings come individually packaged sets three , necessary six strings set . Being new guitars , idea often strings would need replaced three pack seemed like good starting point.The strings good quality , produce accurate tones ( according ) , held well.Highly I say I used several others - coated Martins , flat wounds , smooth wounds , EXP , Elixir , etc . These pretty cheap sound like million bucks . Their tone slightly bright & # 34 ; & # 34 ; EXP . I done experimenting . These strings Takamine guitars . I thought good deal I saw original price , discount stated $ 8 . Instead $ 2 cheaper buying local music store . Other price , strings work great guitar . Sounds amazing . I 'll definitely buying . I prefer light strings allow stretch little might break changing . The lighter less tension use . I love price last quite . This gauge perfect 1970 Gibson J-50 . The alloy wrap brings hidden tonal `` snap '' old , rather guitar . The may bright lighter instrument , really shine old guitar . I keep short . The price unbelievable , 's nice three sets box best acoustic strings market . That 's opinion everyone one ... ... many regular acoustic acoustic electric strung strings . It made guitar sound like 3 thousand dollar guitar . I find inexpensive guitars cheap strings , vastly improved something simple new strings . I really believe strings . When I find good thing , I hooked I use anything BUT anything acoustic . On guitar , strings everything . The tone feel bend 's important . These light VERY easy fingers , unlike clunky stock strings acoustics . I guess think need big , think strings produce volume ... .not . Some disagree saying break 're thin . I would rather shorter life strings , getting pure beautiful , rich sound long lasting flat string . My thick stock strings killing fingers . These effortless play sound sweet mellow , like acoustic sound.Again , someone chime saying ... I would put inexpensive Yamaha guitars costing 10 times I paid . I plans changing brands I 've made string switch . Some say thin strings break easily , change strings often anyway . I string 15 minutes bad day . It 's worth effort . I n't plan hammering acoustic anyway . That 's Fender . AND 's I 'm cheap either . I 18 guitars , 16 electrics . 3 Gibson Les Paul 's , 2 Fender Strats ( one American ) couple ( another great find ) nice Acoustic inexpensive Yamaha 700 nice guitar money . But changing strings sounds like expensive Martin . It n't take long throw set acoustic electric got results.5 stars book , 'd allow . There options unless someone gives set blow away . Low end made China dreadnaught acoustic - Bristol - actually sounds somewhat fantastic terms low end resonance sparkling high 's I 've found . The way string guitar makes difference . With practice I 've become proficient.Curve ball ends better seating bridge plate . Not simple bend kind bend thumb sort catch inserting bridge pin . Then check mirror flashlight use locking pattern tuning pegs keep string quite tight loops tightly around I use microfiber cloth wipe string time playing , - use little finger hook cloth string wipe practice hour daily . The tone I say pretty darn good . Played high end , rosewood , name brand disappointed n't sound much better . Got 3 pack oh great difference , guitar , sound.I 'm 62 guitar ! ! This proves easy helps . I big baby Taylor needed new strings I went wrong place , got Martins installed -- wow make ( bad ) diference . Sounded like record really uncomfortable play . My friend said uses D'Addario make ALL difference world ! ! Tried right . I changed ( big Baby ) color coding made really simple put right string right position ( instead switching E B string like dealer ! ) MY Taylor recommends , D'Addarios seem play nicer tone Taylor important easier fingers ! ! These really sound great acoustic flat top guitars . D'Addario 's best I love ball end color coding . No guessing searching vernier caliper make sure right string right tuner.This coding system consistent thru string sets . Ca n't beat . reorder soon great strings money . I play guitar cou [ ple buddies love sound quaility great I tried strings Zager guitar . certainly ok play fine . nothing far original strings provided thru Zager . little cheaper cost perhaps . maybe last longer . I problem original strings high strings started rust case due humidity I put guitar wood ( I live hot dry Arizona ) . rusted , far . D'Addario Strings Are Simply The Best ! The brightest tone , normal lifespan , fair prices , , louder rest ! I played guitar professionally 27 years.These strings best around tone , clarity , punch volume.Do n't fooled strings may last longer coating sacrifice clear tone.One side note . I hate new used wrap individually paper sleeves . Then decade ago started winding individually , placed loosely inside plastic sealed pouch . NOW , wind two time , place inside plastic pouch . ! Same great strings tone , unwind & # 34 ; pairs & # 34 ; lay two-at-a-time ... kind aggravating , NO ' WAY WOULD I EVER USE ANOTHER STRING ! - lol ! I compared ( D'Addario 's ) manufacturers ... much louder n't idiot . Buy best around string improve tone immediately . sell fine strings . While , favorites ( strictly I prefer slightly lighter light strings ) , still fine -- much better brands I 've tried . I would hesitate buy . playing all-around strings . strings great , lately 've using electric strings instead . work well , sound great , believe really compliment playing . My favorite strings 30 years . Have used D'Addario strings since late 70 's . Always great sound great price . far tell , good strings . They job feel great . Not much say ... I got exactly I expected . Good strings price , nice ring . So far seem last bit louder last strings although flat round expect loud . These best strings I 've ever put guitar , I play really nice strings give fullness deserves . The bright highs , rich mids , bend like crazy I need I used kinds strings . These I use regular basis . They work , sound great , longevity impressive . Most , cheap . Excellent strings . Beautiful solid tone buzzing . This favorite string use acoustic instruments . The strings last long time , opinion . They keep bright look sound , even friend acid sweat guitar.I always liked D'Addario 's packaging . Instead string coming individual envelope marked gauge , D'Addario color codes ball end string -- G green , low E brass ( I think - I 'm memory ) , high E silver , . I really like -- n't explosion paper gig I change string quickly . It 's learning curve -- know system 's great , first times , 's bit hassle reference package find color string goes where.D'Addario favorite string , hands , almost 40 years playing . I decided try mainly due fact I live near , thought thermocouple better . I restrung electric acoustic sounds great without amp . I definitely recommend . I 've playing 40+ years . I 've seen dozens guitars come go I found Gibson J-45 I 've tried dozens types strings . Some guitars sound best Phosphor Bronze . Some sound best 80/20s . I still Martin guitar bright sounds best normally tone-killing Elixir Polywebs . Got guitar-banjo ? Try silk-and-steel silk-and-phosphor . Trust . I 've John Pearse phase . Pyramids ? Yep . Tried 'em . I really liked . The problem back I using , would tarnish packaging . I n't know 's still , bottom line D'Addario phosphor bronze go string . They set baseline every guitar I 've ever owned . ( Note : That 's baseline . In cases , I 've decided something else sounded better . ) For many guitars , including J-45 , 's nothing I 've found I 've liked worth noting : The string sounds best depends particular guitar , also type pick one uses , type music one plays , way one approaches instrument . The string 's best bluegrass hard attack may 's best delicate finger style.Bottom line : Do n't follow leaders . Watch ' meters . Experiment . But , D'Addario great place start . Bought try medium gauge brand . Mediums hard thin fingers stick light extra light gauges . The strings hard slide , un-slippery , changing barr chords made much squeaks I n't like . Tone warm mellow tastes . G-string snapped 2 days later windings string wounds pried right : I 've used strings longer I 'd care admit . String sound personal thing . These work better others I 've tried . To ear balanced timbre across sound spectrum . The five star rating reflection personal taste . Others may prefer different sound . I put strings every acoustic I . They sound great priced right ! You ca n't go wrong D'Addario strings ! I played light acoustic strings long time . I tried make much easier lose tone quality would get heavier strings ? ... maybe , tone still much improved going old light gauge strings new extra light strings.I 'll probably stick extra light awhile . They sound great , I play longer without getting sore fingers . Great strings , fully recommended . I playing guitar 30 years , I use D'Addarios & Dean . Good sound , long lasting . I 'm new acoustic I 'm sure things go , I learned using pics seem pretty good . A little thick style though . They make deep loud noise . I prefer placing electric strings acoustic . They sound much better n't quite loud . If 're musician , things got ta regular basis guitar , strings one things . I give 4 stars rather 5 I know better strings . However , ones great . I like sound provide price nice . I 'll honest , reason I got strings cheap price . I 'm professional bass player plays guitar fun . These seem fine . Good tone stay tune . These strings smooth sounding easy fingers . My acoustic guitars seem like , except 12-string . I switched form Martin strings guitar . Not good price , become new fave . I switch acoustic strings 3-4 times month 2 main guitars . I gig 1-2 times month . These last long , without compromising tone . Great price ! I tried every brand I got . Not sure I try earlier : ( . Probably I Elixir . I really love fact color coded n't mix strings easy fingers . I love price , good brand easy install . Highly recommend It 's D'addario , ca n't go wrongGreat quality I looking forward purchasing brand . Thanks These go-to acoustic strings . They quality string great sustain clarity . I bought Elixir Nanos compare , I like , I think get clarity chording hammering . I 'll sticking long run . Extra Light gives good action small guitar . Not hard fingers . Tone bad 11 12 gauge . The strings sound great full size acoustic - nice bright , warm tone , full bodied sound - great 3/4 size guitar . D'Addario ALWAYS puts nice product . The E B strings never enough coating , still . In comparison others , good job getting music bright sustained manner . This brand never disappointed , regardless diameter strings . To sound complete . Even light strings n't sound tinny , amazed compared big names . They complement Washburns well . Though top line models , I often get compliments like & # 34 ; 're guitars must expensive judging sound alone & # 34 ; . But 's trial & error . I found Washburns sound better brand least far ears concerned . Always buy D'Addario strings 7 guitars . Those strings stay tuned longer last little longer others I tried believe I say I tried many types . They great rating musicians . ... .and price affordable . Highly recommended writer . It difficult discuss taste guitar strings ... .it bit like likes food , musicians , movies ... .etc . We likes dislikes ... taste D'Addario usually strings I back whenever I buy strings . I like full sound lasting tones . good strings love strings . limited experience selecting strings acoustic soon tried , really enjoyed . reading reviews realized actually made good purchase . desire test strings . especially . Arrived beautifully plenty time forward another guitar rarely changes strings , tune . I 'm going honest , I cheap guitar . I payed $ 120 Epiphone local music store I play recreationally . ( , sitting around house , etc.. ) So I 've never really put nice set strings I figured strings n't really going make THAT much sound difference guitar , I way way way wrong ! These strings n't even expensive , actually 're dollars usual cheap strings I put guitar . Yet , completely changed sound guitar sounds like I forked money decent guitar ! The strings high quality feel smooth fingertips ! I used play twice week , I ca n't help want play every single day hear things sing ! DAddario 's go strings Washburn Ibanez acoustics . They sustain well , great tone , tune well , last good changes . I gave strings try , I n't care much . I always used SP ; Elixir 's , I n't think change trying . I 'm enjoying using priced-right set strings . I put strings Martin guitar receiving new DVD customerservice @ entitled `` How Play Guitar '' Eltjo , whose preview GREAT DVD I found YouTube . See preview look Youtube videos Eltjo - 'll want order DVD immediately . I bought primarily cheap . The quality good I would say - great , terrible either . They sound great weeks become dull . They n't last nearly long Elixirs , , lot cheaper Elixirs . I would recommend practice - gigging sound n't quite crisp I would think performer would want . For price though , 's hard knock much . The small e-string string broke ball end tuning . I n't broke string tuning 20 years , never ever one break ball I bought three I ca n't recommend product . Excellent steel guitar strings , string color coded end , 6-string bag three bundles two strings makes even easier figure string goes . Purchased 3 set box , box seperate sealed bag . I went mediums . Try light beginner . I really like strings . Good sound feel good . Not sure much difference tension lighter strings , however . I bought one set , three sets change yet three months . Anyone plays lot know strings much personal thing . The tonal qualities , weight , feel , materials qualities / variables combine make strings personal favorite . For strings bring together string choice 12 acoustic electrics I use play I consider rock ballads using strumming-style play.I love feel tone strings style play equipment set-up . I issues strings , overall , I 'm willing put issues overall performance I get EJ26 strings . The issues include I think may premature breakage . I play & # 34 ; hard & # 34 ; , I play long ( playing several hours daily ) , I play rock ballads using somewhat softer strumming style . ( I definitely & # 34 ; pound & # 34 ; strings - I like think fairly & # 34 ; gentle & # 34 ; strumming . ) Yet , I seem manage break high E & B strings regular basis ( playing , tuning ) . Some expected , bothers frequency I 'm breaking G strings . I simply n't think wound G 's breaking style playing . I 've noticed current & # 34 ; helpful critical review & # 34 ; mentions problem . I change strings frequently I n't think reason , I willing put-up I believe premature breakage ( especially G string ) , qualities draw EJ26 strings . They sound great style play , equipment , set-up . They feel great . I love 'em continue buy quantities 12 acoustic electrics . I wish I better feeling premature breakage . It since I put new strings acoustic guitar . These went problems . They brassy sound . Since purchasing , still ring nicely . My favorite string back '60s I guitar shop . Great strings best packaging . I using 12 's S35 Takamine powering chassis vibration . The result poor sound . Switching 10 's made huge difference tone . It took bit get used lightness I stick guitar . They also easy bends I like alot . I never broke D'Addario acoustic string . I agree 5 star reviews , quality strings last great tone reasonable time , n't break.I helpful hint people little experience re-stringing acoustic guitar removable bridge pins . Put crimp bend string 3/4 inch ball end , 45 degrees straight portion string , fairly sharp . Just beyond wound portion holds ball . Then push ball hole make sure portion string slid wall hole closest neck guitar , way pin . Then slide pin make sure ball resting bottom pin ! The pin fit tightly hole , crimp made string keeps ball side pin , . Each pin groove string passes hole side pin . After pushing pin , pull string direction nut , ball pressing pin sideways hole , keeping tight . It may side bridge inside guitar , I ca n't see verify , I know ball pressing sideways pin ! Not upward.Hope helps novices , I learn way . I multiple guitars , different styles . I use strings Ovation , acoustic leads . Good tone , good sustain , stay tune . I play 2 gigs week average , practice everyday . These strings get workout , I change strings I start lose sustain . That 's I buy 10 packs , I always spare sets hand . These strings I use acoustic guitars . The sound tone great , price right . They shipped quickly I order . I restored old . Yeah , I know ; never heard . Beautiful old archtop acoustic real mother pearl rectangular inlays neck . Frets filed nearly flat half century playing . But resonance D'Addario 's really bring old guitar life thick vibrance bass side , bell like clarity treble side . Not mention great look . The snap sparkle responsiveness stings amazes . Terrific strings price cheapies . I used mine yet brother law says looks like got strings guitar already trust knows I needed replace strings acoustic , chose D'Addario 's based price favorable reviews given users . I 'm glad I chose , play easily nice sound . The lighter gauge allows rapid yet sure fingering , makes ' notes blues effect cinch . In fact , I occasionally remind 's longer need press nearly hard I previously playing strings guitar came . In short , strings make playing much enjoyable , I wish I 'd gotten start . But , without comparison playing old strings , I might appreciate playing half much I . Not much say . Strings personal thing guitar player . You need try different gauges brands till find ones work best style . These string choice acoustic many many years . I replace strings month casual play proper maintenance run store pay shipping 10 times year . The strings great , priced great sale made even better . There less waste packaging help planet bit 's good . Tried . These best sounding book . They last pretty long non-coated strings play nicely , . D'Addario , 's ?

I recently acquired Guild six string I strung usual EJ16 strings , however , n't playing sounding good I knew could . After tweaking action restringing EJ17 Mediums , Guild sounds great plenty punch & power spare.Overall , I rely D'Addario strings instruments . What 's love year-old , company ( beginning days ) responsible dozens string making innovations ? Beyond great tone & playability , suckers reliable get-out . These days string breaks , I know right away I need check nut & saddle , strings n't snap unless something instrument caused damage . In fact , I used snap strings every performance I learned properly hone string rests instrument use NOTHING D'Addario strings . I n't broken string performance years , believe , I ai n't gentle 'em . D'addario makes pretty good string , I 'd say I prefer Elixir . The sound little brighter , strings last longer Elixir . Do n't get wrong though , I still like . If 's sale , I 'll buy . 's tri pack great quality strings good deal ! purchased 2 set works great . sounds balanced ( warm bright ) . prefer change strings often ca n't afford expensive set strings . one affordable make guitar sound good ! anyone needs string go !

640	I bought pedal new , hoping get electric solid body guitar sound somewhat like acoustic guitar stage . I knew going would sound like Martin D-28 , I thought would good enough play couple acoustic parts without switch profound , Boss ? ? ? This far worst pedal I ever used . This thing terrible hiss turn `` Top '' control higher 9 o'clock . At first I thought I must defective unit , I started reading reviews on-line . Seems like part design . It 's bad one hear promise faux acoustic tones , hidden beneath wall fizz . Totally unusable , far I 'm concerned . By way , I tested direct PA well guitar amp single coil guitar ( strat ) . Did n't purchase pedal Amazon , wanted write review . I n't expecting much pedal , quite good . Is completely authentic acoustic sound ? I 'd say ... exactly . But 's kind close , 's far cry lowering volume raising master , still sounds distinctly electric . So far , setting convincing acoustic tones would Jumbo setting . Again , n't expect sound completely acoustic -- 's nice way least approach sound . Check Youtube tests 's & # 34 ; okay & # 34 ; Blues Jr. NOS , really shines Crate , brighter amp less colored . I zero spring verb use pedal 's onboard reverb best results.Used Strat also guitar Duncan Hotrod set . Sounds good guitars -- especially neck center positions.Pedal solid . Be advised comes 9-volt factory , use DC power source 'll want remove battery . To , 'll see black knob base pedal . Just unscrew , pop hood , remove battery . , solid pedal 'd expect word warning . Not sure 's setup , AC-3 effects chain ( loop , front Blues Jr ) , I started getting really bad static sounds sounded like amp -- burnt tube like . When I run alone Crate , I n't experienced . Could number things effects chain , check others experience this.I 'm wondering small , cheap acoustic amp would help acoustic tone pedal . Never tried running electric acoustic amp . Not sure pickup would affect tone . Anyone know ? I guess term toppy describes sampling range , picks higher notes . If want get right effect , good choice . For us , find acoustic guitars difficult play , solution . Personally I lazy blues style attempts play acoustic guitars , often feels like I using manual typewriter . This product says box , sounds better using hum bucker pickups , play strat , sounds good middle neck pickup . Do n't use bridge pickup , n't sound good . It 's amazing makes electric guitar sound like guitar . It 's useful n't want carry two three guitars , ca n't buy acoustic one . It 's best ! The Boss AC-3 serviceable acoustic simulator . I guitarist playing environment ( children 's church ) frequently need switch back forth acoustic electric . The AC3 job . Although several modes , Jumbo mode seems useful . Played carefully EQ 'd amp , get tone comparable plugged acoustic electric bright settings . There audible hiss , less noticeable plugged direct PA , noticeable plugged good , clean tube amp , control humbuckers solid states.The key using pedal using foremost : use single coils . Tested Les Paul Pro 's , hiss overwhelming . Played American Deluxe Strat pups 3rd position , actually performed well crystal clean two - form gain create ton three - tube amps perform infinitely better solid state amps ( tested Frontman 212 Vox Pathfinder vs Orange Tiny Terror Fender HRD ) .The AC3 set forget pedal . Based volume amp room 're , need tweek EQ find tone . I 've read use EQ pedal get tones , I n't found case . If use pedal cover acoustic parts pinch , case guitar player , switch acoustic electric parts quickly , great stars ever present hiss , actually sounding like acoustic 's EQ 'd correctly . sounds & # 34 ; ok & # 34 ; , noisy weird ways . I returned . Price seems high vs. alternatives Boss case metal , mechanical design standard 9V power , power jack back variety acoustic sounds possible . ( personally , I thought 1 sounded realistic though ) fizzy noise integrated notes played ( chords ) - generally kind noisy pedal While I several Boss pedals , I think always make knobs small small . I prefer pedals larger fewer knobs tweaked toe needed playing.Details : The basic concept good . I AC-2 ( prior model ) sold noise problem fizzy noise play note . It n't notes playing , integrated sound every note played ( chord ) could filter . It also noisy pedal chain . Adjusting guitar volume higher gain pickups helps . However , I sold model I n't want pedal chain everything else I n't happy sound . At time , AC-2 's selling $ 85 new . Boss since redesigned AND raised price significantly bought AC-3 hoping improved issues AC-2 -- , little . But enough keep . I returned week still basic issues , pronounced . I think AC-3 could work gigging , choices sound good $ 25 instead $ 130 $ 150 ( tax and/or shipping ) , boss pedal overpriced great.I opted Behringer acoustic instead . They make two -- & # 34 ; 300 & # 34 ; & # 34 ; 400 & # 34 ; . The 400 reverb pedal . I opted 300 got $ 25 . I expect durability lower Behringer Boss plastic case . However , effect I pull since I buy 4 5 6 Behringers price Boss ... .if breaks ... I 'll buy another.I also Boss GT-100 multi-effects unit . You get similar acoustic modelling sounds , Behringer Boss AC-3 . The least cost effective choices AC-3 - noise issues two n't have.I 'm saying bad pedal , I 'm saying n't best choice considering cost , sounds , usage model . If would fix noise issues , I might even kept . I opt keep Behringer times I 'm using discrete pedal board want acoustic model effect . This Boss pedal n't work well .

I replaced way-more expensive Audix condenser mic , actually sound pretty darned good . If I crunch one one breaks , I 'll get price . I Behringer mics laying around , kinda suck . These totally fine . These come stereo holding bar adapter mic stand . They need 48 V power board mic amp . I 'm using mic amp input paging system I review detail later . The comes mic processor cancels feedback sends paging audio amplifier I review set.If stereo recording , ca n't go wrong - self noise level low human ear . It sounds great , setup outside 140 dB gain really performs well hearing birds far away , rain drops comming , sounds never would : NEVER get wet - must cover outdoor use rain.You need 2 XLR cables full stereo recording transfer bar , already know . I use pair mics mostly record piano XY : -Price point-Sturdy , good accessories ( carrying case , clips , stereo bar ) Cons : adjust gain right mixer preamp avoid noise These condenser mics need phantom power make work . I 'm using drum room , one hi-hat one small cymbal . They smooth un-hyped sound.The mics also come nice little plastic mounting bar mount stereo pair right box . I used overhead position sounded quite good microphones kit cost upwards $ 1200 I aware & # 34 ; expensive & # 34 ; microphones sound like , perform & # 34 ; & # 34 ; expensive mice bargain priced.Good music .

I installed pickups different guitars , one pretty n't drill endpin hole , took 20 minutes install bad I tested I blown away . It sounded beautiful ! Just like Taylor , louder ! The true test actual live performance . I brought Baggs Para Acoustic D.I . I glad I did.I able adjust EQ tad , cut mid-range bit , sounded even better ! I could believe . It literally gave 're fence pickup , go ! The reviews n't lie , sounds fantastic , especially EQ bit.I plug without PADI , test still sounded good . If I forgot PADI I would qualms playing straight system . It might labeled passive , 's got volume active system sure ! It 's great buy opinion . I K & K pickups guitars . This first one I 've bought smaller transducers . It needs preamp unlike discontinued Pure Western larger transducers . Like K & K pickups sounds darned good . With decent PA head good speakers get natural sound hardly tweaking . The pickup easy install ream end pin hole accommodate strap jack . This one comes ingenious DIY installation jig made , I 'm kidding , cardboard , tees , double sided tape . It makes placement snap . The best pickup still external mic , noisy situations feedback problem pickups answer . You feedback go adequate level situations . They sound much natural magnetic saddle pickup . I put $ 200 guitar . I Recording King ( ) sounds good , I wanted use live gigs . So I popped K & K . I ran California Blonde II acoustic amp . If wanting acoustic guitar & # 34 ; miked & # 34 ; plug , close gets ! I recommend getting sound-hole cover play band , disappointed . The installation little tricky , little patience reading , anybody install . If n't feel comfortable , go pay local luthier install $ 30 , ask help : P This pick-up sounds good actually sound like guitar acoustically . It pick percussive noise n't get saddle pickups . It prone feedback loud situations n't use sound hole cover . Over I 'm please I able install simple . You need use external pre-amp , even piezo usually norm . The directions comes pickup thorough company helpful questions . The change I make guitar making end pin jack bigger easy . Installed one CF Martin , almost leaving thumb super-glued inside guitar . An interesting experience - would almost arrive emergency room thumb stuck inside guitar . I 'm sure DNA still resides another brand new Taylor GS Mini Mahogany hearing great acoustic sound coming CF Martin brand new Kustom acoustic guitar amp Amazon . I 've read folks prefer K & K ; . . The sensors providing clear full bright sound . It sound muffled . I replace soon . I three guitars trying undersaddle sound hole pickups .

The sound . But ca n't expect plug go . You 'll need feedback buster good preamp . But really job , good tone . 
649	I 've never really owned fuzz pedal , tried . Out I 've tried , I 've come across Big Muff . It n't really strike good flavor distortion recently . Even Boss Metal considered fuzz pedal folks , n't 100 % , budget right , I n't want spend lot fuzz pedal . There loads fuzzes available $ 100 less , model essentially three pedals one . That 's attracted , along reviews YouTube . Not mention bargain basement price.The three modes accessed via switch right side pedal . The two fuzz modes ( view ) n't perfectly emulate one pedal , extremely useful 1 creamy , midrange filled sound . It n't get bright , TREBLE knob pushed past 3 ' clock . This fuzz could make even single coils sound rich thick . With humbuckers , 's actually quite clean silences gain past 2 ' clock . I love way fuzz sputters notes chords decay . It seems work best power chords ( root-5th note ) , single notes . If play complex chords , 'll hardly notice ; try play , use little gain possible.FUZZ 2 line Big Muff . It scooped midrange , makes things sound dark sinister . With increased bass treble , complex chords work slightly better . This fuzz also sustain 1 , buzzes longer . This makes great use alongside guitarist 's using looser sounding high gain tone n't necessarily fuzzy . ( Head era comes mind ... ) The third option ultimately made purchase worthwhile . BOOST . This mode clean boost flat midrange level . It actually distorts little , 's cranking EQ GAIN knobs way . The resulting buzz sound bit like slightly overdriven volume amp ( master volume 's clean channel fully cranked ) . Still , throughout gain volume range , BOOST good job staying clean . This would great pushing amp overdrive , extending gain heavily distorted sound . It might also useful tiny volume boost cleaner guitar tones , maintain stronger signal path full , I like tones pedal spits . I 've hours , I love I 'm hearing far . The build similar Behringer pedals I , noise reducer , TO800 , overdrive sounds like Tube Screamer . With recent pedal ( built June 2010 ) , knobs seem slightly sturdier . I 'd still abuse much , though . As always , really abusive stompers might want look elsewhere ( find way put guts inside custom built tank ) .You ca n't go wrong bright blue LED , either ! Makes easy see dark stage , along orange pedal color . Buy . It 's cheap better Fuzz pedals cost 6 times much . It go clean boost slight octave fuzz heard ... sounds ! Nice features pedal cheap . I like capacity independently control treble bass . Switch actually works makes marked difference pedal . Not bulletproof construction Boss pedal , I quite Behringer pedals I 've yet malfunction year . I EH Big Muff , pedal closer Dunlop Fuzz face . For price , 's another great tool arsenal . One thing keep mind pedal true bypass - string bunch together , going experience dreaded 'tone suck ' . If pedals true bypass high quality buffered bypass , fine . There thing much . You 'll find pedal . I Boss distortion pedals , prefer Boss . Real good variation full ( RAT like ) much saturation . The treble bass control make HUGE sound differences . Its plastic dont jump ! The 1 & 2 ( I dont use boost cool ) make much versatile . You wont sorry ! Almost bought Big Muff another RAT Im glad I spent WAY less money . I 'm acoustic player , every I break Strat fun get little variety . I wanted get cool 70s fuzz going play around experiment . For , pedal great way that.With electric guitar , I 'm tone freak I n't need everything sound 100 % authentic . For , pedal gets 80 % way . It two different types fuzz plenty flexible 're comparing $ 80 Boss fuzz pedal , one probaly lower build quality ( e.g . made plastic ) , 's also $ 25 . I 'm taking gigging stomping garage , I 'll gladly take savings . 
650	This set everyone ! In fact , might get neck adjusted installing set . While I see rockers laying overpowering riffs goal get lowest action I jazz box . No question quality , though , hold fine standards Slinky sets . Awesome strings , I needed ( Drop A/B ) . Good tension.Only con Ernie Ball strings seem wear fast lose tone . So I 'm good weeks I 'll need new strings . In case I 'll probably go D'addario , decent strings need cheap strings fast . They work great . You buy expensive guitar strings , better guitar strings . I use old Gibson semi-hollow body . Does job nicely , I use guitar thats set slide playing I 've problems . Good solid strings I play metal , strings hold nicely . A sharp ( b flat ? ) sounded sweet . Back E ( standard ) provide nice full sounding tone . I used Ernie Ball strings along time . Mostly slinky 's super slinky 's . I read review thought I would give try sound make paired bought replace stockers EPI LP 100 I bought . Luckily I order two packs . I putting top E string turned crank less times , near enough tension string yet even tune yet , `` pop '' broke . I ordered two sets , I put one new set . No problems I got G string , `` pop '' another breaker . Very sad quality.After finally getting tune ( need stretch top 3 strings alot get stay tune , especially E ) I say great sound . Nice tone sustain . Great sound metal , still good clean tone . These thick strings , still bendable , far . I would rate sound 5 stars.Unfortunately , takes two packs strings one successful stringing occur brittle strings . So I give three stars overall . I use standard tuning prs . The sound unbelievable . Thick creamy sound . Lasts slmost 3 weeks tone dies . Good price . Good strings . Great highs lows , rough fingertips , difficult barre chords , slides , single string progressions . OK effort So heavy strings work well . I issue strings messing bridge guitar springs worked well enough . Tried heavier gauge string playing slide guitar . It worked perfectly . I 66 years old playing Guitar fifty years . Of course years I 've tried strings always seem come back Ernie Ball strings . There surprises . The quality Is always . Also , I believe best value dollar . From extra slinky heavy gauge Jazz strings , You ca n't go wrong . I fairly new Amazon customer finding important trust factor hesitation part shopping . heavy gauge main strings I use . Detune great , good harmonics , great presence , I use across whole range genres , metal Blues Funk beyond !

The Dunlop Schaller versions strap locks usually twice benefit I see.They lock securely , n't require strap guitar use different finishes match guitar 's Dunlop straplocks I n't see reason pay Dunlops . 
654	Cost efficient . perfect guitarist loses wears picks easily . like alot . probably buy next year ; ) I love picks , favorite ! I bought pack 72 trying pack 12 last year . These picks sturdy wont break easily . I use rhythm runs even lead . They perfect rhythm , flexible . My wish grip ( raised end hold ) . For lead sound dull . I much prefer brighter , chimey sound.Overall great product ! Get ... To , 's much depth go describing guitar picks . Either feel good hand , n't . Either kind & # 34 ; disappear & # 34 ; 're playing , feel like hindrance . These Dunlops get right . Enough grip 're fumbling place , somehow get way playing . They 're right Fender Classic picks , all-time favorites use . used picks first time , never could use different picks ever ! great price , BUY THEM ! I love guitar picks . I tested alot , far best one I found yet . They perfect hold , tough , although I wear quickly , I picks . Almost perfect pic . I use .73mm . Just wish like fender pic finish ... fender seems stick fingers better . This pic seems coating makes slightly softer touch something . Still prefer pic fender one holds much much better- comparison fender mediums . hands absolute favorite pick . I tried many brands , materials & various thicknesses I always come home Dunlop Red .50mm ! Between blue yellow , I needs covered . These weird feeling first get , like powder . But within 10 minutes using , 'll stick much better . I love picks . I 've tried every gimmicky thing imagine always gone back simply works , Dunlop Tortex .73mm picks , I 've tried different brands , shapes sizes get way , n't slick like others , stay hand wear ok ( long I n't get wild ) I ever drop one show super easy floor due bright yellow color , I would lost quit making changed , hopefully n't , great ! use acoustic electric always lose ever wear . I dont go lighter yellow picks sometimes use green little thicker . I always keep lot hand . These picks I use playing acoustic guitars ( strumming style & vocals ) . Since I play several hours nearly every day I tendency go lot picks . These definitely last longer brands ( similar weight ) I used . For example , I & # 34 ; round-off & # 34 ; end Musician 's Gear pick Fender pick hour playing seem get much mileage picks . The weight great style playing . They seem durable brands . They 're inexpensive since I play lot hours I always keep lots hand . I love 'em , use daily , rely ! ! ! These picks great , best part 72 pack . I always spares . This thicker pick , I would recomend try one 72 . The complaint comes wife , since tend pop house ! I 'm beginner guitar player going intermediate I 've quickly learned anything Jim Dunlop quality stuff . I 've using Dunlop Tortex picks years , .60 .73 acoustic & electric picking . They feel great , 're easy hold , exactly amount give & attack needed style playing . If I complaint , 's edges wear use , sometimes quite rapidly . Still , play well , 's worth cost regular replacement .

656	I take thing rig every awhile , always finds way back . Unlike , I put end chain , right Boss Line selector , multiple amps . I used put beginning , metal days , well . I 'm blues , love end . With fuzzes I cracked nice lightly smooth , end EQ , I got jacked ! Unlike people I love bass players V EQ . I love bass , I play 10 's 15 's speakers handle better 12 's , although I 2x12 V30 's sounds nice . This must pedal though , matter want sound end like , stuf need edge really nice stuff looking last bit tone , got thing . BOTTOM LINE UP FRONT : If play Orange , Vox , Marshall , n't necessarily EQ pedal , putting one signal chain take amp next ? Well , design amps wide musical EQ overall frequency response narrow . This led many British amp manufacturers include specialized tone shaping buttons control panel well aware British EQ n't dramatic American guitarists want . There nothing wrong means - 's overall characteristic British , tube amp loves pushed boost dirt pedals get extra crispy overdrive clean channel - since distortion channels tube amps tendency compress limit output slightly . This pedal capable providing boost . seems right amount push clean dirty , dirty overdrive , overdrive : If 're rock band plays small venues like bars clubs , 've probably noticed bands overwhelming noise ( ) vocals clarity drums instrument matter . EQ signal chain allow clean tone cutting unnecessary low-end picture boosting high-end better : If 're using pedal DI box simply plugging directly audio interface virtual reamping , 'll able get balanced signal want darken Strat brighten Les 4 STARS ? Yes , noise . It 's bothersome means , 're recording mic 'd amp direct , absolutely need noise suppressor . I use GE-7 BOSS NS-2 , NS-2 completely removes white noise generated GE-7 . The result amazing , clean boosting YOU ON THE ... go ahead get thing . You wo n't regret . It 's Tone , really make cheap gear sound way better , take great gear next level . This 7 band . great way change sound guitar . It flexability tone knob . It 's easy way get scooped metal fine tune sound amp guitar . Highly recomended ! Product arrived exactly condition described seller . This unit allows great sweeping frequencies . 15 dB pull direction seven bands filter worthy , My dissatisfaction lies amount noise unit adds chain engaged . When unit transparent , tone suckage . When unit engaged , frequency band sounds nicely however , consideration unit modified reduce noisy output begun least . I thankful internet opportunities presents MOD Pedal . I 've pedal since 's , I started playing teens . While EQ might seem like odd choice beginner 's pedal selection , I mainly trying compensate crappy bass mid-range cheap Marshall amps I used back . Since I better equipment , I n't used , simple , definitely useful tool . You leave time mold sound greater detail amps would knobs . Or , on-board volume crank volume solos louder negatives I recall using added bit hissing noise ( much could n't trap noise gate ) , seemed take away sustain notes bit . Again , nothing ca n't fixed effects . And think important equalization stereo equipment , makes sense might want level control guitar amp well.I give 5* despite minor flaws says BOSS products built rock solid . I 'll thing forever . 
657	It 's well made . Not much else say . Buy . It worth . Packaged well . I ended ordering cable connect 535Q Wah Dyna Comp Pedaltrain 2 board . It 's perfect length , 1/2 foot cable little bit short . Since , I 've ordered patch cable lengths , 've done great job cleaning look pedalboard . I really good luck planet wave patch cables . They n't huge amount use , none went bad caused excess noise , I 've bought 10 . I got Christmas gift 're bad . I put pedalboard I previously longer cables n't stay jack . I problems jacks cable . If I play loudly room vibrates bit , cable even works way jack little bit cuts signal . Awful . Perfect patching effects pedals together apart . Good quality cable good price . Most cables Planet Waves I 've never issue . These cords work great helped ( finally ) clean mess longer cords running various voice processors mixer . The set-up went mess eight neatly wrapped 6 ft cords 1 footers . Looks great . Cords sturdy - I n't I foresee issues . Would definitely buy . It comes lifetime guarantee feels really sturdy . They come many lengths sleek effective . Great price well . I purchased Planet Waves Classic cables new pedal board . The cable little fat connector pedal board use tight fit cable . However , I pleased find cable quite flexible . My complaint , like reviews I read , end n't seem fit snug connections . For cables fit well MXR pedals , Dunlop wah Ibanez pedal . The Boss pedals however , hit miss . Ca n't say sure Plant Waves design problem Boss , seem odd seems mostly Boss pedals . I couple EHX pedals also , one side snug loose . Anyway , money , I think happy Planet Waves cable , nice ends good flexible cable . awesome patch cables pedalboard . rigid typical patch cables works winding around pedals easier twist angle however want without stressing input jacks . love Planet Waves gear . 
658	So good I bought another one . Love heavy cord gold connectors . Guitar sounds great . I learned last night coil . I guess I read instructions carefully . But harm done , still works great ! These n't first set , I ca n't count amount Monster 1/4 cables I bought . None ever failed far . Highly recommend ! I love sound built well . Do n't buy cheap cables . They rob tone . These best cables money . sure 'll spend bucks sound great hold guaranteed life . What else could ask . All I use cables The biggest question I ask cables , worth premium charged normal cables ? The key lower end 100 series Monster cables , Monster Standard 100 1/4-Inch Instrument Cable ( 12 Feet ) . The answer mixed , depends looking for.The cable ends heavy , metal unscrew . In ways probably good , feel good hand plugging unplugging . The jacks gold plated look like would last lifetime . On hand , series 100 plugs molded plastic end , good bit flex , lighter weight . So choice , heavy , shiny gold ; light weight , ? For , I like heft likely lifetime cables . Check pictures I 've posted . The metal housing screws jack . There seal top portion threads . Inside wires soldered solidly jack , whole thing cast solid acrylic plastic . Unless run end truck pulled really really hard like tug war , wire never separating jack . I n't think actual 1/4 inch jack sturdier excellent . They clear clean cables . Are better 100 's ? Oh maybe tiny bit . Maybe little clearer , cleaner sound . But n't huge line , gigging , probably go 100 's . The jack ends get stepped point cheap enough replace . For practice house , probably way go . They look particularly good plugged Marshall half stack.These cables priced like everything else Monster Cable . Study different one quarter inch jack cables 'll see priced close everyone else . This case cables big box store fifty times pay . These cables work well transmitting sound . So three stars ? Well , far well thought instrument cables find . These stiff , thick , heavy . While 's good analog cables , cables stiff heavy , instance , portable tuner small stomp box might easily moved around one end cable there.With many amps plastic jacks days , wonder kind stress cables might putting amp jacks output jacks cables tuner around plugged one . I mean , let 's face . You never know happen gig . Sometimes 're playing 12 foot cable 18 foot cable . A cable n't come gentle pull , 's cable falling moving bass head around tripping , want cable fall . If everything heavy Velcro 'd ground , n't problem , . I feel like 're playing cables , 're worried stepping cable want pull , 's seriously like trip wire there.Lastly , plugs huge . That 's really problem play Strat Tele , P-Bass J-Bass plug comes right angle body ? This going stick lot , loop around strap , 's going huge , stiff , cumbersome loop . I know people often buy 90 degree plugs kinds instruments , normal straight plugs fine . So yeah , like move around stage , get flexible cables . You 'll thank cables poorly thought . They 'd work great patch cords , keyboards , drum machines , pedal board amp ( long metal jack ) . Monster cable costs half much works twice well actual instrument use , price , Pro Co cables also excellent , brand name plugs , well . 
659	I needed new guitar . From looks , complements instrument well . I happy . I used ukuleles , worked well enough I bought tow pairs .

660	Nice thumbpicks banjo . They size large , generally large hand tight . I larger hand work well , micrometer away snug . But I like lot . Would also work fine acoustic guitar picking 's whay 're ( though I always preferred acoustic picking without thumbpick ) . I really like thumb pick The thing I may large ( girl ) NO WAY large man . I think guy may problem wearing comfortably . So , Ladies ! This good purchase ... much guy . Others reviewed Item I read purchase , noted & # 34 ; Large & # 34 ; picks warmed shaped fit thumb . I also found original & # 34 ; Large & # 34 ; size , The curve pick cut thumb improper shaping small average American man . I still process shaping 5 , otherwise appear sturdy I n't broken one similar type several years . I expect pick wear use . They appear quality brand , shaped well average player . These fine n't fit well ; quality product . In case , I actually needed medium small fit tight . I 've used thumb picks forty years variety acoustic guitars . My thumb nail ca n't pluck strings I damp heel hand . These adequate sense strike strings stay . They sound compared favorite , long gone National clear thumb pick current Dunlop clear . I like sound Ernie Ball thin celluloid picks n't strong enough grip thumb . The major problem n't large . They 're like brands ' medium . My thumbs n't Tom huge , hands bigger average . These picks cut thumb I use fifteen minutes . I think I could brighten sound sanding , 's lot work something n't buy large thumb . If like less bright sound , people , medium sized thumb , might work well . I like , nice tortoise look planet wave logo nice , flex I also find suits me.They ride little higher , I also like , like low , let 's say midway across , may find bit ? But I find gauge suits great overall comfort good , average thumb size . I unusually wide fat thumb , though tight first , got comfortable hour playing ( ) . No complaints Ordered large picks like others mentioned , large . I average size hands thumbs pick initially thumb twenty seconds tight . I solved problem simply holding Bic lighter flame half inch away heel pick three seconds . I could feel celluloid loosen quickly . It matter pulling pick open bit . It 's actually easy completely customize size shape picks seconds heat . The picks fit fine , I n't even need place & # 34 ; foreign & # 34 ; objects microwave questions feel free ask I answer best I . Thanks.SPO nice sometimes comfortable rest time . cheap exactly supposed . I get 5 thumb picks order ( previous reviewer mentioned getting 4 ) , I always really liked classic turtle-shell look ( far purty-like plain , thick white Nationals others ) . But large ? And , yes , I double checked packaging ensure I shipped large . The National mediums I using looser fit . But nevertheless , Planet Waves ' far tighter fit actually feel better National mediums , certainly clunky sensation ; probably small weight difference two would explain overall feeling quicker movement good solid strings . All , 4 stars . Still ... large ? Hate see mediums fit .

Hosa cable quality place , products good ( sound good , reliable , long lasting ) products good ( affect sound negatively , break prematurely , short useful life span ) .These guitar cords actually quite nice , feel good ( soft rubber jacket like Mogami ) , sound good far working reliably , rubber jacket .25 & # 34 ; diameter ( eye ) short heat shrink add strength wire plug.I bought I needed cables fast internet concert , lots pedals signal splits connect . These cables arrived good working condition 've using continuously since.We dozen tube amps particular sound degradation far cables disappointed would buy I needed . It 's cable , frills , tangles pretty easy due 's design might rattle little move around works like I never really considered cheaper cable , I always taught get best I could afford . When showed cable search amazon , I jumped . I figured I nothing surprise , excellent cable , good build quality strong , thick jacket inspires confidence . The sound identical Monster cables , cost one quarter price ... , guess I tried figure instead listening & # 34 ; snobs & # 34 ; many years . I never worth money twice , try overpriced cables ! One end loose , I tightened , keeps coming loose I put dab crazy glue threads , hope I n't ever open end repair . For price , feel light I n't trust build quality key stress points ( cable meets connector ) , I going push guitar accident 's plugged ... seven bucks gets job done . Recommended `` beginner '' thing testing waters.Otherwise , spend bucks something higher chances lasting . Hosa makes good stuff , exception . I 've trusted years , I ca n't think single Hosa cable I 've owned 's failed . Only complaint size fault . If buy least 15 foot plan use stage . Hard day much , works great . No issues speak . It job perfectly well For price , works really well . I see faults . It unscrew pretty easily , hardly problem right . This cable notion get pay . It 's quality outweighs price . Let 's face , cable cable cable . But quality cables vary greatly . I replaced lighter cable one I surprised difference quality sound amp . I Ibanez ART series guitar Ibanez 15 watt amp set home . With nothing changed cable , significant difference quality volume . So much I checked guitar teacher said surprised . The quality appears good . The ends heavy duty little bit hum I due proximity everything attenuated point . I 've seen expensive cables one ( far ) GTR210 Guitar Cable 10 Ft I looking long cable perform live band 'm glad HOSA quality . It feels reliable without adding noise . These Good cables good price ! ! Not sure would hold heavy use , practicing home really great ! sturdy , high quality little feedback , use performing friends love Unless 're going go top line expensive professional chords , medium sized venue . I many lengths Hosa cables problem them.I active musician , put throughthe riggers happens stage ; I comment thistype usage.In 40 years ( 10 stage ) I come realize , thatyou ALWAYS extra cables ( like strings ) , expensive cables sometimes let . I 've using 3 weeks - strong flexible n't seem develop kinks bending `` habits '' roll proper way.I 've seen used better cables price point . And I 've certainly seen quite worse ! This pretty good sweet spot , opinion . I 'm pro-cheapo I hated thing . They 're noisy , cables feel really cheap , . Drop bucks get something else ! Works great 100 watt Amp . Almost compares monster cable . And Its length Its plenty Room Guitar amp . GOOD PRODUCT ! Good cable , good expensive brand . Thick , bit stiff seems shielded . No complaints . I lots hosa cables cheap quality . I 've recieved one bad cable around 50 . I use lot guys work get , n't failed yet . 
666	These Martin strings ( ) n't bad . They sound I looking . I ended like Ernie Ball Earthwood extra light instead . The Martin 's little shallow low end unlike Ernie Ball . Other people love though . They easy play . These good average guitar player n't want much strain pain fingers . Not tone , would n't expect extra light strings . I electro acoustic Martin ( second hand without scratch ) . I got .13 strings well , simply much .

667	This works better QK10B model company . Slim easy install though longer QK10B . Since cut button one side two parts , might rotate mic boom , etc. , achieve proper position connecting two parts . My use IPad clamp attached mic stand . It worked well I put two place stand could break packing gear bag . This unit wiggles little much QK10B little bit movement acceptable . This looks well built reliable . The long haul test . This doctor ordered . I bought three purchasing 3 . All units threaded nicely stands microphone holders . If I switch one mic another stand , could easier , press little button . With different shock mounts different mics , I n't worry re-threading mounts time I change mic stands . The time saves also invaluable . No problem quality control 3 I , I complaint build . Great studio , I use mine , would think It would clumsy performer takes mic stand , use clip that.Addendum : I love much , I bought one mic locker , stand . That 's total 12 . None failed almost years worth use , best invention mic since shock mount . These save time , guaranteed ! I swear quick release clips . I ca n't imagine working without . I save much time time I use quick release clip instead unscrewing re-screwing original clips . These great way mix match multiple clips multiple stands . The first items I purchased I started last job Audio Engineer . I 've got complaints . They work great every time . I used variety types adapters past , excellent newer version . In case I bought one quick release use mounting kick drum microphone stand adapter permanently attached microphone . With quick release installed stand microphone , kick drum microphone mounts stand mere seconds stays place well.I n't quite know locking ring silver adapter black everywhere else , least ring good quality threads clean precise . If mobile DJ needs put mic clip mic stand event get one . It saves 5 minutes per event ( setup break ) put mic clip event . These great little accessories nice convenience . The allow singer remove mic stand without normal loud pop removing wireless clip . This particular model adds feature locks microphone desired position ( older models would swivel without much effort ) . Bought 6 replace older models I stage . They 've worked great : mics stay position popped straight stands , spinning . . 
668	My first wah Morley Steve Vai Bad . I loved . It 's switchless pedal I put hell . I 3 months I send back cause broke . It 's still ok pedal I wanted ability leave pedal `` open '' achieve certain warm sound . That 's I went looking cry local retailer several different kinds cry babies set . I put one Hendrix , Classic , cry baby pedals basic one sounded far best . The one sounded better 535Q $ 200 price range . I paid $ GCB-95 cry baby worth every penny . I n't even touch Morley anymore . It 's cry baby way I 've using Crybaby going 30 years . Some guitarists claim signal chain affects tone negative way . Well , I 've never always feel perfect . Also , adjust part sweep 're using easily - ie want treble bass little `` comb '' moves wheel pot.I 've tried wahs . Morley n't , Vox good , I always gone I knew . No complaints Crybaby . I got pedal cause expensive , I love music . I used play big concerts I tell price good ever wants fun learn use pedal . Well , got one messin couple hours ... Now 's Fun king wah wah ! ! It 's big , 's hard 's heavy turn understand original . It sounds exactly like always imagined , like records ... This one gets big 5 everything wanted ! MY experience crybaby great tone . More overbearing Vox cleaner wahs . BUT I know several people problems switch , I watched countless others stomping crybaby futile attempts engage disengage pedal.I actually use BBE Vox since frustration 1st wah . But I sure I giving tone exchange headache ! I kinda think I . The VOX BBE seem brighter sound less `` wah-ed '' . It could accentuated playing Strat instead Les Paul combination I used crybaby . Great pedal , pull open put couple cheap mods , thing rediculous ! It 's boutique pedal little time solder . In opinion one finest pedals exist . The crybaby still pedalboard long I foresee . pedals come go , get modded re-thunk ... .But I always wanted original Cry Baby ... So birthday gift road I add electronic mods available personalize sound , time I 'm gon na enjoy pedal `` '' Good Buy , Great packaging , delivery - Thanks Amazon ! My Cry Baby 20 years old pedal board . I rewired true bypass replaced give Wah broader range really n't sound better . This pedal covers & # 34 ; White Room & # 34 ; Cream Tone perfectly . I gave 4 stars n't maintenance free . The pot came loose switch replaced considering fact survived several hundred gigs smoky , I probably give 5 . Sounds like original . Enough said . Great pedal still built like tank . I appreciate version , one use pretty standard AC adapter . A+ . The problem pedal step way turn , produces sound . The Morley pedals separate on/off switch , turn given position . The difference sound bit professional wah n't always turning top wah frequency . wanted set wah middle , leave . You ca n't really pedal . It bit smaller wah , experience , sound equivalent base models . first petal kind . I read Wah shoud first I went . glad I . Wah petal much fun . make many cool sounds imagination allow . It hours hours fun . sounds great . I problem performance . works . I highly recommend petal . 's price attractive well . I love wah . It 's perfect . I really ca n't find negative . It 's perfect standard wah . You wo n't regret purchase . Just put good analog fuzz & 're good go . I 've got MXR CAE concert line pedals ... one one I use local gigs home use Fender Telecaster Hot Rod . Finally broke got new one original crybaby bought finally died . A great pedal , well made ! If want guitar sound like Eddie Van Halen , Joe Satriani guitarists studio album guitar sound , get BOSS GT-10 ( guitar multi effects processor ) install BOSS GT-10 Patches James Limborg . Search Google BOSS GT-10 Patches James Limborg . It good pedal , n't sound I looking . It great playing funk music , us metal heads , wah weak . For metal artists , I would recommend looking elsewhere . I going look getting Ibanez , Morley , whatever Behringer days . `` Oh crybaby '' , `` I crybaby wah '' , `` You suck n't crybaby '' ... I 'm tired hearing statements guitarists fresh could n't even tell many strings instrument ! This wah pedal n't cut . Maybe one time , today , n't par LONG time . As young player I wah pedal . My mom bought one . I thought awesome I learned better . It took week learn turn I finally I thought I broke ! The eq pedal n't good , smooth transition heel toe . There big drop . kills effect . You pump foot really fast avoid drop . You pretty much push toe literally stomp turn follow steps turn . Very inconvenient someone trying rapidly move effects board . I ca n't say complete piece junk , give wah effect , classic pedal THERE IS BETTER still stuck stone age thing ? I even someone mod mine gave little headroom fixed dropping issue , I still slam turn on/off still sounded like cheap wah.My suggestion ? The Mark Tremonti wah great ! things end comes range simplicity use ! It may cost , probably end crybaby getting one anyway , go Tremonti Power Wah begin . What I use wah Digitech processor . You may say cheap processor , , I 've using years I n't seen anyone tell price based sound quality thats matters . Why I suggest wah control sensitivity , hard press toe turn ( I mine set fairly light ) totally shape tone right board easily . You even presets ( crybaby one ) You get entire processor full effects AND awesome wah little bit more.If want cheap child 's toy , . Want get serious wah ? every crybaby see go elsewhere . I 've wah pedal number years . What I say put lot use , problem pedal , mechanically . However , cheap rubber feet first victims perhaps taking cheaper short cuts producing product . That say , rubber feet began come time . If mount pedal board , probably remove feet wo n't problem . Also , power supply comes stellar job powering pedal . If like though place pedal board unified power source makes sense must use different power cable , least unit , jack fitting properly leading serious shorts . Those shorts make crowd deaf time flat . What I learned using different power supply sure power jack push ALL THE WAY , , . Other two issues , power issue really fault Dunlop 's use supplied power cable , great pedal . A classic surely live . , still best ! like guitar music ? chances good know sound pedal makes . one . stand alone outside multi effects unit The Cry Baby proven since 60 's . It well made pedal must , play classic rock . It takes bit practice master , mastered ; take music different level . It sounds good adds soooo much noise pedal board . If 's problem , definitely worth price . Some things n't need change . Some Wah pedals try tempt built fuzz , eq , wacky add-ons WHY ? I 'd rather one pedal job perfectly pedal bunch stuff sounds less great . The Crybaby great effect style ; everyone Jack White Jimmy Hendrix used incarnation pedal . It 's must 's really say . I acknowledge opinion - perhaps I bad luck unit attempts repair afterwards . But I loved sound functionality wah-wah pedal , would literally last months time became unusable . I suspected potentiameter shot , I replaced , problems reoccurred . Like horrible static noise soon started using it.Good product , hopefully make durable particular unit I .

670	I like product lot . For , problem time `` sustainer effect '' .It long I thought . I though would like piano 's sustainer . But 's good pedal effect . My guitar get good sound `` attack effect '' . Thank . As several previous posters mentioned , need noise gate use pedal ' . I completely agree . And sustain notes . It actually raise volume make sustain . But extraneous hiss guitar playing cover . The way get rid hiss use noise gate . I use NS-2 I use chain pedals . That said , pedals wonderful uses . Every note volume . You hit chord hard like softly play volume . You set sustain days . Again , need noise gate . There nothing transparent THIS compressor almost compressors , none `` '' one . Perhaps 's price pay pedal . I recommend messing quite . You incredible funk , jazz , metal vibes . Man perfect ! Some people says cs3 noisy I thinks depends type electric conections got home place play , n't independent circuit pedalboard 's gon na lot noise , bcuz compression ( obviously ) ... For PERFECT , n't make noise conections ... recommend ! The Boss right , I using excellent results , I many compressors , Line6 , MXR , Behringer , Digitech , although I alternate use Boss stands many rig configurations , feel little bit sometimes general good product , I highly recommended main compressor , dont like probably dont know configure , good luck . It really give anything 5-star review BOSS product , since I 'm big fan product line build quality overall . Those compliments apply equally CS-3 Compression Sustainer . And job reasonably well without worry putting brand signal , minor issues pedal need know . The two common complaints I see adds `` noise '' amp changes tone bit . The former complaint probably true , though 're enough hobbyist use Compression Sustainer , 're probably already contemplated using noise gate/suppressor , BOSS NS-2 . Problem solved.As latter complaint ( changes tone ) , 's also true , 's necessarily bad thing LIKE tone results . The whole point CS-3 's supposed cut extremes tone sustain . This result muddy , `` '' tone , though play TONE settings help . I also find settings 12 , output quiet compared pedals default settings.Really , BOSS pedals considered `` expensive '' compared many effects , CS-3 really viewed `` budget '' `` entry level '' compressor , consider quality compressors either rack units something like Keeley Compressor costing north $ 200 . The best thing say BOSS ( even compared similarly-priced MXR options ) CS-3 gives great deal control compression reasonable price . The biggest negative pedal , opinion , resulting sound might seem little ... lot things could CS-3 , works best paired pedals ( chorus , delay , distortions ) 're trying smooth . Ultimately , 's pedal could better , though n't many significantly better alternatives get north $ 100 anyway . As pro musician , I always quest better tone expand different gig situations . I bad experience Compression Pedals years toss closet & give thought.When I upgraded pedal board , I decided give idea adding Compression unit give G & L ; American Legacy ( Stratocaster style guitar ) sustain lower volumes . Boss company effects board ... I rely Tuner , Digital Delay ( 2 ) , Line Switch & Direct Box almost every night ( gig & Practice ) somewhat negative attitude going I great surprise find I really , really like unit . It I wanted & ! Great tone & sustain little box & stays `` On '' position time I playing electric guitars , especially Stratocaster styled guitar I . 
671	Got today put X series . Nice sound . I would recommend anyone . An inexpensive nice set . Sounds feels nice . I entry level guitar , Peavey . It came entry level strings . These strings make sound like upgraded advised , low E string thick . When I try depress 12th fret , I ca n't get register hit Rocksmith 2014 unless I press middle index finger . Well , sometimes pinky needed . weaker score learn guitar using game . I used set years . Nice whole set . Sometimes buy EXL115 without wound third , find wound third single string . Not fun . I like sound wound third . I play thin hollow-body electric love strings sound easy fingers . No thick fingers . Playing weekinds practicing , last long time sound quality . They nice thick sound , bright enough clear , good mids , nice bass notes , clear trebles . I like em . I got five months ago still broken . That record . The tones warm welcoming , sharp strings . It sound I like though . D'addario forefront quality long lasting strings long I remember . This guage perfect arch top guitars .

673	THis 5 star stand , considering price . Sure , 's sturdy one costing lot , 's supposed without problems . I n't forsee mechanical issues construction seems solid enough . It 's music stand , I n't see would take lot abuse . I bought two , one sons ( 12 14 ) . I wanted something sturdy would stand test time boys age . So far seem awesome . They adjust easily , easy assemble great weight . Definitely flimsy stand . Attaching hardware bit cheap better I ripped I almost lost screw washer.This work fine I think . I 'd shopping music stand local music stores , cheapest price type solid backside $ 45 plus tax . This item including shipping cost $ 23 Amazon , seller Musician 's Friend sent promptly , got within 10 business days without problems . I trouble putting stand together without instructions . The bolts n't easy adjust compared perhaps expensive stand , I n't care . It 's hard adjust , time I certain height , need fiddle , group performance , need adjusted different people ok could smoother . If 're someone needs fiddle stand height constantly might want get higher priced one makes easier , occasionally going adjust height , 's big deal . Other , solid handy stand meets expectations , 1/2 price retail . Excellent . I 'm completely satisfied . A great item price . Comes two pieces easy assemble . You need put two screws attach head stand . Each screw wing nut tighten hand . It took 3 minutes put together directions . It looks solid goes much higher many stands . Its also pretty lightweight I said head comes two screws want break traveling . I satisfied purchase . I bought granddaughter use home flute practice . Very sturdy well made stand adjusts easily even 12 year old . Should last long time . The stand seems sturdy , base like tripod base mic stand , may hold better long run stands `` clamping '' type base . The top stand shorter others , really problem worth mentioning . The gripe I could stand top takes two screws two wingnuts , practical use gigging / setting / tearing . I leave one studio use others shows . For price , sturdy seems nice quality . This definitely sturdy well made stand - I fault . Solid materials , everything snaps latches tightly . Good materials . Works like 's supposed to.I two complaints , though.1 . The part holds music n't wide stands . I probably could read description realized , I made assumption stands size . It 's wide enough hold two regular sized pieces paper . It hold bigger things , course , edges go past edge stand . So works , , looks unprofessional stuff leaking edges . The nice wide , though , hold pretty thick stuff . But using quite wide materials , especially , want look wider stand.2 . Adjusting height tilt difficult . To alter height , one twist untwist tightening ring ( like one finds microphone stands ) . It n't pull push like majority music stands I 've encountered life . Adjusting tilt requires untightening tightening wing nut back , bit difficult reach . Unlike every music stand I 've used one simply force position . The good news , though , everything held place wingnuts tightening ring , everything stays right one puts . No slow sliding height , slow tilting plus side , sturdy , feet retracted ( word ? ) parallel stand , making moving around stacking quite easy . I love fact feet this.These excellent music stands . Sturdy , portable , little extra weight worth investment ever want put music book ( rather single sheet music ) stand . Those flimsy , music stands worthless IMO , especially evening . My bandmates upgrading stand well primarily play indoors ! I guess least one us bit windbag . The music stand similar stands used schools . This stand durable , firm easy assemble . This exactly music stand supposed , thing awesome ! ! ! I love ... Thanks great affordable product Needed music stand certain width fit gig bag . This one fit perfectly . It 's adjustable allows fit clamp-on microphone boom arm . Saves space cramped gig sites . Do n't lose wing nut , though . It tends fall ( since must completely remove break stand transport . Not worth lowering 4 stars , though . heavy duty , pretty sturdy , finish best world certainly job intended , holds secure adjusts easily stable lip hold material without slipping turning pages deep enough set metronome . Easily adjustable , good finish , solid , much stable folding ones . Just I need . This metal ( . adjusting screw ) stand , 20 bucks . value ! ! What 's say ? These stands great lesson business . I bought couple right height weight . Yea could music stand amazing ? Well compared worthless folding portable pieces . It actually hold 500 song fake book ( know one- weighs 10 pounds ! ) . It stays set works wonderfully . NO complaints ! 
674	I play guitar stand behind vocalists . If bring voices back I & # 8217 ; hear especially female solo pieces . It big help & # 8211 ; better could eliminate buzz causes church & # 8217 ; sound system . As musician I wanted PA instrument amp , I also wanted extra inputs outputs . This . Whether want output TO PA FROM PA ... ... TO guitar amp FROM ... ..and even play MP3 player play AND sing . If need inputs , output mixer . The tone controls nice bass get quite amazing 5.5 '' speaker . bass amp sub-woofer definitely full sound . Certainly loud enough gig definitely enough supply outdoor party music . I know 's copy speaker/amps ... Behringer . I think 's wonderful adequate Must-Have musician . I like speaker system , behringer makes good products comes . The sound good loud , control levels EQ directly need mixer . You connect ipod laptop . And multiple sound options including phantom , instrument . I used female xlr 1/4 trs cable I told also use xlr xlr , although I try . The price great wattage nice . I must say , people come easier hear sing . With playing piano sometimes hard hear voices equal sounds nice harmony . I also connected microphones distributes sound evenly sounds good : I recently bought guitar started use amp electric fender , IT WORKS GREAT ! The sound great , wattage good , everything wonderful . Highly recommend amp want small amp guitar . Love thing . It sounds awesome built like tank . It sound good $ 300 $ 400 monitors music stand mounting clever . Does everything I want personal stage monitor . I purchased PA reading several reviews convinced right . I like small fit right backpack . I using ION system got much carry around . I go around different venues sing . I started April taking vocals year . I love much I 've purchased Shure mic . powerful speaker system . I love crisp sound I hear sing I turn music . I needed something EQ well . really ca n't go wrong . I would rated 5 except I turn around 45 degrees begins hiss . I 'm sure normal . see I purchased open box speaker . The outer box packaging questionable opened PA prime condition visible damage materials packed well . The sound great . I 'm testing home still time I 'm comfortable hissing . Hope helps decision . So I originally got virtually identical Mackie version crapped couple years easy work . Behringer typically good making comparable gear better prices . I use vocal monitor attached drum rack . So much efficient floor monitor . I volume tone settings fingertips , one channel , I run full main mix one channel mix separate feed pa channel . Very cool able mix loud harmony , turn little ear without affecting mix dynamics . Definitely recommend ... Hey get volume tone control space ! I bought unit son 's edrums inputs ( RCA , Mic & Instruments ) . I plugged guitar channel 1 , mic 2 & edrums RCA 're good go . Not loud 10 '' 12 '' speakers course small room . Playing music RCA channel also nice need adjust EQ get good highs lows . Light weight portable . I play 1-2 nights week duo . Our PA pair Mackie 15 '' ( powered ) floor Behringer 12 '' ( powered ) stands Mackie board . We adjust PA room adding reducing number powered speakers . In larger rooms regular pair floor monitors smaller rooms stuck corner coat rack waiters station ( know spot generously removed two small tables ) n't space floor monitors . These smaller jobs become much common I needed compact yet powerful monitor . Since work midi sound modules reproduce drums , bass assorted extra , important hear sounds clearly . The Behringer monitors job well . The overall sound clean clear , speakers light portable boom stand adapter works well . I compared Behringers `` clone '' Mackie 150 frankly I could n't hear major difference MP3 player playing . Obviously Behringer cloned Mackie 's good job . They inputs outputs Mackie 's look almost exactly . I owned pair Behringer powered speakers three years knocked ( accidentally ) still work great every night I fan Behringer gear . In end real difference price . The Behringer 's go $ 150.00 Mackie 's go $ 250.00 . The choice simple ; since I could n't hear ( see ) major difference I bought Behringer 's . I two months I pleased : It couple months since I started using monitors even purchased additional one . I still love sound things I posted : forget boom stand adapter . It difficult get lined mic facing angle monitor adjustable boom stay place . I using good quality telescoping mini boom big heavy stay . Save headaches carry another mic stand . Other great monitors . got 3rd monitor . great price . got 2 days ... .so . first 2 units bright blue ish color LED power.the latest one mellow amber color else noticed different color LED 's ? comparing units , newest one seems differnt type feel impact shell.weight sound same.i use everything full band acoustic . great vocals guitar . stated others much bass response ( 5 speaker would expect ) dropped , wet , hot never missed beat . 
675	Great strings . I use Deering II work well . Deering recommends ( I imagine entry level banjo manufacturers ) sticking light gauge , light pluses mediums . So stock . Good strings , overly prone corrosion . I bought couple sets strings banjo . Strings matter preference sound feel . One person may love next may . They playable strings , aluminum rim saga banjo sound little bright . I took put another wood resonater banjo , sounded much better one . One reason I buy strings made U.S.A Why buy strings n't tell made.I put set medium set liked sound better little harder strings must kept clean want last . wipe string done last longer . Well , I ordered 2 sets , 2 sets medium strings I got first banjo , I n't know gauge strings I would prefer . So far I like light strings better clawhammer , mostly I play . Easy fingers sound good , ears least ... Not much else say strings : Would recommend . I love strings sounds pure twangy , pretty easy use . Each string labeled know goes . I 'm beginner change strings , I 'm proud . As far banjo strings go , good bang buck , I got . D'Addario makes pretty product , I 've used everything years , although I prefer certain brands things . Strings cheap part easy experiment . These also amazingly enough still made USA well.If buy cheap instrument , favor get decent set strings chances 'll strung trash 's lower end instrument China . Even 're starting tell difference right away . 
676	I play guitar . I bought one various thicknesses picks years ago . They 're interesting . These soft rubber little bit give , really soften attack cut higher frequencies , similar using thumb , exactly . I still pull one every awhile . In certain applications , getting particular sound song , say , could exactly 're looking . Overall well made , ones I bought probably last forever , would never work main pick . I 'm glad I tried though , I nothing else remotely like . My tried kept one three bought . So I guess loves pick I 've seen use . [ She playing ] I love eliminate pick noise , n't expect use electric guitar -- 're simply fat . They work well bass acoustic , however . Do n't go ' version -- much give tend stick strings leave without pick . I think going use sometimes bass , found one pick feels right . Saves thumb strum ; grips nicely fingers strings ; A Rock Roll grip . I purchased use mandolin . They ok . I personally prefer little stiffer pick , kids using Uke 's bad purchase . This 5th bass pick I tried , finally works great . It slide hand soft tip nice sound . I converted guitar player I like playing pick . I like sharp thwack sound . But tone little harsh , I got . They much quieter hard pick tone bare fingers . For , waste money . I 've using weeks , I say I keep going back . They make notes sound like bells . It 's holding better I expected ( I relatively soft player ) I 'm adjusting ' mentioned . I liking time goes . Glad I tried ! I got itch try different ' picks ... , dunlop primetones , felt picks , metal picks , etc . I get annoyed plastic clicking sound regular thin picks.These interesting . They perform quietly give mellow tone . They however stick strings becomes difficult use , need getting used . I wish I ordered hard version rather medium , bit softer I wo n't daily driver , interesting none less . The best part pick easier strings , still gives pick tone , seems less damage . 
677	This pedal , used host others board ( 'The ' ) , claims . It seriously boosts instrument signal Tele mere 50 % level setting makes subsequent MXR Distortion + pedal crackle goodness increased sustain . I 've purchased host Behringer guitar pedals last year ( used , I might add ) happy every single one . Do n't let cheap price fool ya . I 've using manner guitar pedals work since 1970 's - yes , I 'm `` old '' - stack anything similar expensive manufacturers offer . I 'm glad I 'm getting $ 50 world figures reliable Behringer jacks price everything . Oh yes , I use OneSpot 9v power everything , I comment quickly pedals plow batteries . GOOD ! thank u behringer ! pedals really kick ass , one outstanding , price get better deal , highly recommended . Every guitarist needs volume pedal point gig . THe Behringer Preamplifier/Volume booster pedal inexpensive yet quality volume pedal works great ! I got several years ago , I pleasantly surprised , really nice acoustic raise volume soundhole pickup direct box . I gave one I used couple years . This pedal exactly says 's supposed . It boosts guitars signal . It really well , little noise . The thing I like `` sledge hammer '' type pedal overdrive . The input signal cleanly boosted . What put input comes louder . It starts change signal allows raise gain slowly . It gives signal guitar stronger output whatever plugging ( amp , mixer , effects pedal board ) . This pedal arrived door Friday afternoon I took gig night without trying first ( something I n't normally ) . The first two times I used pedal night ( Friday ) next ( Saturday ) . I thought worked great needs . A days later I read review said pedal noticable hiss . Since I n't remember hearing , I got home plugged amp ( I amp home I use live ) . When activate tone set flat pedal volume 12:00 , sight hiss ( noise bypassed ) . For minor hiss live situations normal room noises I never heard . This may true amps maybe high gain input amps may handle signal differently . I know sure lot quieter almost effects pedal I ever owned I box full 35 years playing . I using Vox VT30 modeling amp lots effects ( delays , chorus , flanger , compressors etc . ) These days I n't use additional outboard effects ( except Sonic Stomp I never turn ) siganl guitar hits amps input cleanly . If use various guitars gigs , pedal useful . It allows quickly match various guitar output levels compensate differences humbuckers , single coils piezo pick ups acoustic without adjust amp controls . This great problem solver rig needs control input level amp bare bones price.I owned several Behringer pedals live work Behringer rack gear live audio rack home studio . I gig reguarly twice week faithfully . I never broken problem gear ( including pair Behringer 12 '' powered speakers mixed pair Mackie 15 '' powered mains ) . I n't intentionally abuse gear packing s*** happens far Behringer stuff never let yet I many years . I also keep reading people worrying hard plastic cases Behringer pedals . Do n't worry . They sturdy enough . ( Just watch changing battery dark stage . The battery goes pedal switch spring foot switch probbaly fall careful . ( To open battery switch cover use pen small phillips style screwdriver push black pins either side pedal . ) I purchased budget passive soundhole pickup guitar I bring local open get volume sound guy boost channel high sound still bit thin . I found Behringer PB100 reviewing various posts well checking YouTube demos device I purchased . I used past four weeks open mic impressed boosts sound without effort . I add bit bass makes guitar finally sound . This pedal makes budget pickup sound like much expensive pickup . Item body plastic rather metal . This expected price . I would call `` sturdy '' least 's $ 25 instead $ 125 , works . Professional musicians may impressed occasional noise issues ( I 've found true many Behringer products ) . Nevertheless ... works reasonably well.Received item good time . There 's one real dislike I item : * The battery access ... goofy . To access battery one must take foot pedal `` inserting ink pen hinges '' . Two hinges , two hands ... tricky process best . Not easiest battery access I 've ever seen . However fair , relatively minor issue . I became relatively skilled short time.Initially product n't work . All I could hear static amp thought I defective unit . But I noticed gain turned right box . sound got much better . additional problem old unshielded guitar cable ; replaced good one sound smoothed out.This sensitive unit , wide gain tone range . It excellent Bass Treble tuners . It seem somewhat sensitive movement noises apparently noise filter kind box . guitar cords could cause static . That could cord issues box issues . I 'll experiment hiss easily audible room environment . Behringer seems problem hiss products , dunno . But sound comes 's difficult discern hiss ; 's extremely loud annoying ... 's there.Bottom line cheap unit cheap price . It job work fine instances device would needed ( passive pickup -- non powered acoustic instruments ) . I 'd recommend need thing simply relative ease use ( foot petal on-off switch ) relative low 's so-so estimate , cases so-so good enough . : ) 
678	I originally purchased strings 11-52 gauges . I wanted set strings would slightly lighter tension regular set light gauge usually somewhere around 12-54 . Upon installing strings , I ca n't really see much difference size regular light gauge , maybe 's small notice naked eye . I 'm entirely sure strings louder marked improvement old DAddario strings replaced . They might little brighter clarity due new . The guitar I 'm using , small body nice mellow sound anyway , everything sounds nice smooth . Overall , I 'm satisfied sound performance new strings , I n't think I 'm ready give yet . Arrive time described . I yet install expect surprises used strings past . I read many reviews guitar strings well talked many different guitarist . Pretty well favorite set strings . What interesting agree specific type and/or brand . So I reckon find . So far strings worked still experimenting find & # 34 ; ones love & # 34 ; ! Ernie Ball really something Slinky series , offering nice range weights . I swear Slinky , set Martins . I use strings acoustic guitars . good brand good tone . 5 stars one . THESE ON YOUR SQUIER AND YOU 'VE GOT A $ 2000 'd describe sound bit & # 34 ; & # 34 ; , definitely sharper tone . Heard good things Ernie Ball Slinky string set decided give try son 's Taylor GS Mini . Replaced worn strings guitar back business . Honestly though , hard really compare strings , seem fine currently I see reason try another brand . In conclusion , I see reason buy install click YES review helpful , encourage continue writing updating reviews , leave comment questions , I happy answer I help .

680	Nice cables . So far I 've problems , n't put lot use yet . Also Monster audio cables work well , cost ! I 'll see time brand lasts . Have try amps . By , work really good interference least ears I like last lot ! ! second planet waves cables I first ones still great conditions ! ! cable perfect ! great sound quality durability . I buy cable except planet waves ! best bang buck working musician hands , yes cheaper cables , ,but n't sound good last long , Planet Waves way go I many Planet Waves cables . They well made . I like molded ends seem help prevent shorts . An excellent value . I would highly recommend . I bought replace cord I using practice guitar . My first cheap cord n't actually broken , I n't want time , I sitting replacement . Fast forward time , I wanted try . Even though cheap cord still working fine , I really wanted try new cord.I really wish I done first 30 days . This cord work right . It seems like short somewhere . I unplug/plug/ maneuver place . Of course since guitar , falls almost immediately place . So , I back cheap cord n't failed , unlike brand new bad cable . Look ... You let build quality cables sound quality . I Monster M cable . Put , I fail distinguish difference sound . The difference ? Price . These cables ONLY cable I ever use . Go ahead , buy . You love . I love cable . They last ever NEVER cause buzz noise . These ones I buy . Probably best single thing cable going Lifetime owned Planet Waves cables past twice I sent back replacement ... problems whatsoever.For price paying ( $ 1 dollar per foot ) get good quality cable , good cores shielding heavy duty retention jack connector best , worst . Good enough live stage gigging probably wo n't notice much difference recording.I n't noticed RF hum noise moving cables.They also come set colored bands easily identify cable goes , cable owner , price lifetime warranty make `` feel good '' purchase.I would recommend cables buy . As reviewers noted , ends short dont allow cable `` click '' jack guitar amp . Easily remedied cutting back rubber 1/8 '' cable I like cable construction large sized ends . You ca n't beat beefy thick cords price however flaw , On pedals guitars pop cause length metal shaft short n't click jack . measured length short 1mm so.I go razor blade carefully trimmed rubber insulation took care problem . Minor annoying detail cord pops guitar ! Super low par better many expensive cables Mogami , Canare , etc . The connectors fantastic come Planet Waves ' super-handy elastic cord wrap . These outstanding guitar cables VERY good price . I used buy cables serviceable connectors , , I n't see point . The lifetime exchange warranty also makes DIY repair thing kind pointless ( course Amazon 's return policy still 30 days , aware that- 'd need mail back take another dealer exchange - ever ) . using cables three months . I use Guitar Multi Effects sound great . decided get one cheaper ones little online research I found suppuosed take abuse hold better time . good lenght , course taken consideration type venues 'll playing . far I 've used rehearsal studios using live first time couple halloween gig I 've got coming end month . The Planet Waves instrument cables nice heft click firmly problems all.The attached elastic tie comes custom cables makes easy coil cables storage.5 stars . I start saying cable produce sound quality Mogami Gold cables . If recording going meticulous sound , might cable you.HOWEVER , price purpose five star cable . The plastic plug ends relieve stress connection , also feel sturdy secure . The gold plating ensures solid I like cable 's guaranteed life I bring Planet Waves authorized dealer replacement ... packaging claims . I replace mine . These cables high quality , feel hefty durable . I wish I 'd gotten one longer 5 feet though since I play close amp two five footers . Oh , well . I 've using one year , problems . I really like durability clear sound quality . First , I 'm big fan D'Addario strings Planet Waves division . So I needed quality cable right angle plug , I got one . I n't really know 's better brands . But job 's well made . I using standard version , I saw Amazon figured I 'd give try.These cables little stiff standard cables I using however ends seem much well n't make difference sound ? I n't know I satisfied purchase . 
681	Well 3 hours put together got tiring annoying things tend fall standalone items great good sounds groove tracks practice drumming I drummer interest becoming one..I bought order use software recording basic beats fit songs..and week support help either MY WARNING IF YOU WANT TO USE THIS WITH , EZ OR OTHER LIKE THAT YOU MUST KNOW HOW TO OF MIDI IN ORDER TO USE IT . This plug play item spend hours time trying get work software ... There little helpful info net 've owned week still never used purpose yet stand alone really MIDI support..Im close giving fight sending could made amazing item 1000 times easier simply created midi port module could run software.. Other reviews give adequate overview kit potential I 'll mention particular details : The kick pedal spring tension set tight , making pedal hard control frustrating beginner . Fortunately thumbscrew nut adjustment easy made tremendous improvement feel documentation poor , , 's nothing better available online Alesis : The steps graphical setup page less ideal single person assembly . The kit allows tremendous flexibility positioning pads horizontally vertically , yet 're pretty much left discover . Experienced drummers know want I would appreciated suggested basic setup showing common variations.The control module 's buttons operation described 's detailed guide preset kits selectable pad patches . You 'll hear seems ongoing controversy firmware update controller module - whether fixes issue snare drum pad responsiveness struck simultaneously hi hat , fact cause issue pad . I 've noticed problem , date , Alesis update site , leads suspect former patch may bad and/or 've updated units currently sold.Speaking snare , second outer zone rimshots nice I get trigger sticking outside . The technique laying stick flat across head lifting one end n't seem trigger rimshot ( perhaps I n't worked touch yet ) .I 'm interested natural sound , probably close classic jazz kit , couple presets work . I also Battery 3 using kit trigger samples opens vast possibilities . Still , time I want sit play n't want bother PC loading software 's nice two workable options . The headphone volume could louder running powered speakers taking headphone solves pads clean easy two soft lint-free cloths . Dampen one little warm water ( wring well ) use light circular motion remove dust dirt , wipe gently dry cloth take residue.This first experience electronic kit , others mentioned , sensation really different acoustic instrument , particularly striking cymbal pads . It takes awhile mentally balance soft thud click ( depending surface strike ) outside headphones sampled drum sound within . I n't sure I liked first couple weeks ( meaning I probably n't ) I 've gotten used gradually begun relate terms , imitation acoustic drum kit , something else special characteristics . For money costs worth . The construction seems good ( especially kick drum pedal ) , brains leave little desired , although 's functional . The biggest complaint I 1/8 & # 34 ; stereo 1/8 & # 34 ; headphones . Really 1/4 & # 34 ; mono stereo . I bought separate plug allow I could put mixer I 'm good . I 'll try keep succinct say needs said . Setup fairly easy ( although instructions downright ) . The adjustability wonderful . And kit looks phenomenal box . That said , one toms nowhere near responsive rest ( I 'll soon contact company replacement ) , cymbals intuitive strike placement ( get secondary cymbal tone strike hard , even 's guarantee ) , I 'm guessing , due close proximity sensitivity pads , snare often activates I strike hi-hat . At first glance , different tone kits n't bring much table . But wide range available begin dig deeper controls . To small extent , I 've even able cover tom lowering volume pieces . My complaint bass drum n't bring much table . It sounds like flat tom bass short ; kit somewhat defective box . But 's still fun use . So , unless plan record electronic kit , I 'd recommend product fun musical toy . But 's certainly par expensive kits I 've used . And recording kit would likely nightmare . I beginner wanted set I learn , would also allow experiment percussion instruments besides rock drum set would take small amount room allow low volume levels . I 've set month half . So far , working well . The rubber drum cymbal surfaces great keeping volume low enough playing late night . Each drum cymbal seem sweet spots I imaging triggers . Depending devise , hitting sweet spot might change sound and/or volume produced . The impression I get electronic drum sets kind problem another , seems whether problem ( ) something live . Also , ca n't play nuance control acoustic set , price goes long way making seem real enough I enjoy feel like I 'm learning drums . It takes little space compared acoustic set great since I little room . There problems I 'm likely encounter I become really accomplished . One playing snare rim shot either hi-hat tom 1 simultaneously , one trigger sound occur half time . I found playing combinations rapidly , I 'm likely maybe ever . But still error functionality . I called Alesis said common characteristic model drum set . There firmware update mentioned earlier reviews I , n't make difference . In summary , price needs , I pleased drum set . More expensive sets sounds better nuance control n't rubber surfaces I want , plus , according reviews seem problems type spending money n't necessarily eliminate problems . 
682	I 've got two Levy 's cotton straps I picked local brick mortar stores 're fantastic ! I picked one Amazon I unaware length ' version I bought . I suppose 's easier theNo big deal though , observation worth noting picked one based prior purchases ( 're big guy like and/or play guitar/bass around knees ) may getting thought.In case , comfortable ( soft edge ) , stick ( opposed materials may tend slide ) , last . Wonderful inexpensive strap . I use electrics problems.Well made easy adjust . This strap feels pretty good feels like would durable cheaper stuff . The issue I ends size I could install Dunlop Straploks . It may one I got though . This Levy 's `` Guitar Strap '' good looking ( understated sort way ) , well made , adjustable extremely comfortable , works exactly bought son `` starter '' strap figure buy flashy one someday , one looks like used foreseeable future ! Highly Recommended ! CFH Not much say guitar strap ... except I planned use acoustic without pin neck . I ended using strap Strat acoustic one Strat . This one n't come wrap tie nut , use guitar pin sides body . If need secure one end headstock , option . It comfortable though . I bought intending use Seagull acoustic tonight I put Squier Fat Strat instead . getting tired raw existing polypropylene strap price `` Fender '' it- making I put electric difference immediately noticable even though neck still sore cheap strap . So I decided sign write review.This strap softer better made poly ones.It even comes string tie acoustic , might taking advice : Treat yourself. $ 15 strap guitars cost hundreds ( thousands ) , cotton suede scratch axe ... The downside strap ends pretty thick snug use snap-on strap locks longer I 'll see venerable Grolsch strap locks work.You spend get wider straps padding want bother getting something cheaper unless strap least quality sale.Update : Too snug Grolsch strap locks Squier also ... Very comfortable strap . The cotton soft cut neck like nylon straps . Seems sturdy well far . This perfect strap guitar . It 's rough neck adjustable . It 's simple perfect . I 'm pleased purchase . comfortable , looks perfect beat black Tele custom . I 've never complaint Levy 's strap , 're expensive always seem worth pay , unlike brands ( Fender ... *cough ) . I admit I bought John Frusciante uses similar style strap . But good taste . This strap strong sturdy . Even without strap locks I 'm comfortable going crazy stage . High quality , fray , stays guitar . Does want need looks great ! I like walk around I play . It 's mine . This strap works fine . The thing I 've noticed annoying strap moves easily across back easy get guitar position ( neck high low ) . Other , 's good deal price . Maybe I need shirt cling . In interest full disclosure , first guitar strap I ever owned . That said , strap fairly soft pliable , almost broken feel . I expecting little stiffer , I 'm glad n't . It fit Ibanez acoustic fine . My guitar nothing fancy , I would presume `` strap locks '' pretty standard . The fit really tight first , good thing . I suppose I could unscrewed strap locks mounting strap , I range fit seems pretty good . I 6 ' tall wear acoustic little high , kind `` folk style '' I guess . If I want , I adjust rides lower around pelvis area . One end suede sides tanned patch , end black suede one side tan suede backside . I ca n't see marring guitar . It comfortable around neck shoulder . Made Canada , seems well built durable . Once left shoe happy lace back , gets keep head . If questions , feel free ask I answer best I . Thanks reading.SPO Only complaint well done shown picture . Other strap good quality . 
683	I play steel guitar add effects song different ones solos . I 'm always looking something add extra appeal certain songs . This easily adjustable , adds depth sound . I use often adds interesting sound possible effects . It 's easy use combination , instance , Chorus , Tremolo , dynamic steel guitar sounds . I trying find good vibrato pedal long time . I bought $ 150 pedals $ 100 pedals I got one $ 25 blows others water . The side pedal either need run 9volt Behringer power supply . I could n't get work properly pedalboard power Pyle-Pro DC supply . The plastic case feels like may break anytime aside I love pedal puppy playing harp middle daisy field . I 've wanting pitch vibrato pedal n't want spend $ $ 500 old boss vb-2 ( pedal sounds exactly like ) looked I n't really know expect I got I amazed , sounds really good . It maybe less durable metal pedal cares price I would n't mind buying new one mine broke considering hardly companies actually make pitch vibrato 's ( uni-vibe/Vibe pedals pitch vibrato pedals ) buying new one n't problem . I got mistake , confusing tremolo effect . But , either way , I liked decided keep . It 's really good deal price . And sounds good major brands . The problem people find material 's made . It 's like hard plastic , metal like . But , 're person gear , last good while.I use recording , hiss , like Behringer pedals , I record direct , amp . But , live playing , 's great . It 's especially perfect garage bar bands . I fairly low expectation ~ $ 25 pedal , many people said sounded close , better , vintage Boss . Considering I n't want spend pedal , I ca n't compare 2 say works well . It subtle , fast shimmers ridiculous warbles . The rise knob seems act reverse level control , least turning weakens effect ( I guess good , I might swap around leads ) . Finally , LED used , means wo n't blind try adjust settings.Being $ 25 however , plastic case noticeably cheaper quality looking compared even Behringer 's $ 50 pedal , hinge little less stable . It still hold moderate use . However , could wear plan heavily using latch feature ( momentary mode ) . pedal , buy , 'll probably keep ! At price point - 5 stars . I keeping probably going become addition pedalboard . Only time tell I like adding vibrato clean sounds . It reminds lot I used set Super Reverb amp . Compared pedals , I 'd actually give 4 stars - downgrading 1 star plastic case limited functionality Rise control . But I liked much I decided score `` price point '' dirt cheap $ 25 new pedal- sounds great - add subtract frequencies add noise ( I wish I could say $ 200 pedals I 've tried . ) - mode -- best feature pedal . I love I put unlatched mode use vibrato short Small form factor - normal `` single pedal '' size- Standard power supply - 9V Center negative - runs pedal board power The larger foot pedal surface ( compared silver bullet switch ) nice unlatched mode useCONS- Cheap plastic case - I doubt durability would preferred pay durable switch small ( hard reach , bend , ca n't toe ) - Rise control subtle impact sound . Probably needed pedal . Two larger controls controls would better design usability.- Like pedals - knobs super small easily controlled toe , settings hard see . My favorite pedals large knobs , well marked settings see distance , enough space knobs set one without bumping another , best cases , enough space , size , durability knobs tweakable foot toe , `` Super Vibrato '' `` Vibrato II '' 1 ) Change metal ) Rise control ) put modes 2nd stomp switch stomp go ) size space two controls -- put large `` foot controllable '' knobs high visibility , 25 bucks , I might buy 2nd one put one latched one unlatched mode . DOA ... good , box , plug , nothing ... ..no way send back ( I ` States ) ... ... I wasted away $ 40 something bucks ( add shipping ) ... .I bought Behringer pedal ( ) good results , I guess ` two sides particular low economy pedals ... , I ` man buy something else ... pedal well made plastic w great electronics made designed german sounds like chorus vibrate , , wave tone quiet , , w true bypass great pedal money , , get . worth . guitar bass keys . 
684	It 's tough shell $ pedal effect , I 've weeks I 'm glad I bought . Although guitars pretty much stay tune , warmer weather humidity levels affect guitars change little I 'm playing . The Boss TU-3 bright easy read keeps tune time . When play band , got pedal tuner ca n't go wrong Boss . I wanted upgrade TU-2 , I years . This TU-3 easier see , precise 's tunings . I recommend ! I tuner attached pedal board fantastic . There tons settings LEDs nice bright dark stages bright outdoor venues.Highly recommended As Boss products , I 've happy . The tuner easy use ... need I say . I 'm days 440 tuning fork tuning , GREAT ! I 've owned many tuners years I keep coming back one . buffer mutes play quality great price point I know spending kind money pedal n't even add effect tone sounds pretty crazy , definitely worth . If think , guitar tune , n't matter perfect every aspect playing , equipment , set-up ; still sound bad . So , way , important pedal pedal works great tuner vividly displays far tune . Works great mute switch , one click 've got sound - perfect switching guitars and/or muting sound.The design quite sturdy well , feels solid . I definitely recommend pedal . It works well 95 % time sometimes problem G string . I use tandem snark tuner together 're fail safe . ( snark tuner also get buggy together 's statistically unlikely I n't worry ) The stomp tuner also benefit able signal , hence I would n't use snark tuner . The title pretty much says . This simple , great tuner . The streaming light effect extremely cool yet totally practical ! Great deal . This thing works great ! I play live clubs device indispensable . Accurate quick - great song quick tuning.It 's Boss pedal - rugged reliable.I seen pedal pedal boards top touring pros , recording artists session musicians around North Texas area . I play locally regionally North Texas see pedal almost EVERY guitarist bassist 's boards every product - well made - worth every penny . ** UPDATE using tuner month I say I made right product every guitar player needs - period . ** ** ** ** ** ** purchased another one tuners alternate pedal really best tuners - get one today ! There comparison anything else - nothing - I looked ! I really enjoyed tuner , extremely fast accurate tracking . I 've surching decent tuner months I 've demoed pitchblack planet waves tuner , never could track well TU-3 could ! What I mean tracking , I 'm talking fast respond changing pitch . Its great tuner , little pricy , worth long run ... I even surprised included battery ! 
685	I large hand slide loose finger . I order smaller size . I trying learn slide riffs . This thick glass sounds fantastic strings , My bad ordering one large . I found price Amazon cheaper local guitar shop quickly bought . The slide works smoother brass slide acoustic/electric guitar also sounds great Cigar Box Guitar piezo pickup . The slide thick large size fits well middle , ring pinky found tone guitars brighter defined using slide compared brass slide suits electric guitar better IMO . I tried ceramic slide guitar , Dunlop ceramic slide likely future purchase.Jim Dunlop products solid last long part , slides seem popular brand aside boutique bottle slides I think one last long time . For 's supposed , works well . I also medium size one fits bit better I think . This still usable , big fingers . I think I slightly fatter fingers average guy , still leaves extra room . Either way , works well . It feels sturdy I 'm worried cracking anytime soon . For price , 's must . I large hands ( I wear XXL glove ) I guess thick fingers ( Size ) . If want use one ring finger , consider getting smaller size.As tone slide , warm great sustain due heavy glass ! This first slide , I never use slide play guitar , look good size right . I learn use ; - ) I bought along Clayton `` large '' glass slide . Well Clayton thin walled n't even fit ring finger . This slide thick works great ! I thought large would perfect fat thing big . It really n't affect play n't matter . 
686	This comes adapters pedal would need power look picture , I LOVE way mounts power strip . You actually put several ( needed ) side side , unlike power adapters take much 2 spaces . It rated mA I try keep 1500 looked power requirements pedals combined accordingly . n't sad somebody produces great product screws description ? The product great value money worth buying , reason save money overpriced DC power units manufacturers pedal units . Trouble say whether cables come unit . They n't ! ! Dumb , needed say needed buy separately , I later . Seems like nit picking ? Well , 's live abroad things take long come . n't ? Used one I forgot mine loved much , I get -- Small , takes one spot power strip outlet -- Long cord great ! -- Enough juice power pedals simultaneouslyTotally worth buy . Do ! Highly recommend adapter transformerless high current capacity powering numerous guitar effect pedals . It highly reliable introduces hum noise . Also , designed plug power strip without covering adjacent receptacles . Thanks Amazon offering great product . It works great five lower power pedal type items , including Line 6 wireless receivers , Shure wireless receivers , several pedals like Cry Baby , etc. , . However , transmitter Shure wireless in-ear monitor , requires less power two items combined , run , even , powered 1 Spot . Switching power supplies like mind , probably little quirk Shure transmitter circuit power supply n't get along . For stuff works great , eliminates bunch extra power supplies cords . I use One Spot Adapter 5 pedal attachment . Works perfectly ! I 've seen reviews brand noisy . I suspect happening 8 pedal version . Too many one simple 9 volt source 've owned couple months , used home 5 days week rehearsed high volumes dozen times . Zero hum buzz unit . I also mention I drive/distortion pedals board . At begining I n't sure buy since lot reviews negative , I decided buy I started problems right box , I notice noise coming amp also bad performance pedals , I started play realized I many pedals connected daisy chain , I decided leave one connector alone available used 4 pedals surprise ! , connected power strip eliminated unwanted noise performance started work fine , I also realized pedals positions ( routing signal ) something , I could n't figure works fine got right , I would recomend play little set make sure avoid abuse , work supposed . This great invention . I five different guitar effects pedals loop station attached . It really saves batteries extension chords . It well worth money . This answer power supply needs . If 1 pedal ( ) You need . It powers Wah stomp boxes 1 plug . It comes different power plug options daisy chain 5 pedals . It adapters power pedals without place plug attaching battery snap battery place pedal pluging daisychain . It also pin plugs attach daisychain pedals require kind plug . 10 foot lead wire reach pedals pedalboard without drag heavy extension cord across stage trip playing . 'll save enough money pay time , buy batteries . Get , 'll love ! I I use house pedal power testing new pedals.I n't use pedal board n't know I would recommend heavy live use . I suppose one reliability would key work well power many pedals one time . I use powering one pedal though . This device puts lot juice noisy times less expensive pedals.I also like fact takes one spot power strip without covering power use - . I choose rating cause best Adapter I 've found . I like n't heat even get warm although I use looper . Another plus length cord best cause I n't need use extension cord . One less thing set , carry around worry . I Truly recommend One Spot Adapter everyone .

688	My kids excited split pack picks . Since two pack , n't argue got pick . These unique nice way personalize playing . I think would make great gift parent played guitar 60 's 70 's . I like guitar picks colors , well designed useful , comes different shapes colors , makes easy locate lose floor anywhere reason I bought I needed , I live real place buy drive home work , I got delivered doorstep , , well world The guitar picks exactly I looking . I like hard picks ones I needed . These picks proven worth I thrash strings epic guitar solo extreme metal I find playing often . Great picks , would buy 'em line : These guitar picks outstanding . 
689	I bought cable band 's live show setup . I bought almost year ago still currently use application . While best quality cable , length price make good value money , especially 're buying several time . I n't use cables studio live , 're fine . I 'd recommend cable 're budget looking buy several time . If 're going buy one , I 'd look Canare Mogami , 're little bit expensive easy get worth price . If 're used live performances last long ! Good price . I need resolder ends concert though . There 's nothing complicated purchase . It 's cable . It works . It n't cost lot . It 's great deal . Get it.I use every week , still sounds perfect . Then , , I never equipment . I bought cable order able run longer cable runs stage . It works . It 's narrower gauge wire cables , makes little durability . I tend use cable runs I n't expect lot movement ( e.g. , running cable mic stand ) save better cables belt pack jacket cable pronounced rubber smell , really activated allergies first . I stored mic cables open cardboard box months using , seemed help lot rubber smell . Not everyone allergies , might issue folks -- I could n't use cables anything near face first 're cheap work fine . I n't noticed sound issues . I 've cable awhile I 'm impressed quality . The plug jack look cheap cable thin . I use home practice mic n't much workout . I n't think would hold long stage venue . These cables little thin compared hosa GLS . They picked little interference equipment well . lacking shielding . 
690	received cable , sounds clear , n't feel like made best materials , I got cable today I ca n't really comment durable long last , far I tend believe decent cable price , I n't use microphone often cable last . far working well , I would buy another one I needed , price right , Should need connect condenser microphone phantom power box work ordinary amplifier mixer without phantom supply good length link . I needed balanced cable connect clip-on mic pickup acoustic guitar.It works perfectly recording rich price , ! My studio powered monitors require balanced inputs . I purchased several cables varying lengths found quite acceptable application . I 'm sure I 'd put remote recording kit -- 're really heavy duty . But speakers static applications , 're fine . Noise free cables good connectors affordable price.I used acoustic drum microphones mixer without problems . 
691	Good quality , strong excellent finish . Nicely priced . A foot rest help maintain good posture playing , must classical players . It exactly says . My complaint I wish could go notch two lower . But pleased . It 's cheap works like champ It 's great versatile foot rest guitar player benefit , good value $ 10 counting shipping , satisfied . I 've guitar accessory shopping spree lately , favorite purchase late . I 've bought nice straps , I 'm practicing hours time , foot rest great reprieve , literally weight shoulders . Was using box great help . My stomach n't feel wrenched anymore . I use right leg guitar right leg . Maybe conventional classic position works . Great foot rest , 's flimsy . But 's light weight . I put guitar bag carry I definitely feel 's . I like 's adjustable various heights . I short ( 5 ' 1 '' ) I usually highest setting prop left leg I 'm playing classical guitar get guitar right angle . But I sometimes adjust I switch right leg I 'm playing Flamenco rather rest guitar legs like classical posture , I shift right leg . I ended getting 2nd one I keep one highest setting I 'm playing classical , one lower setting Flamenco playing . Great foot rest , I recommend . Just I needed position guitar seated . I worried would hold weight , well . I looking foot rest good value exactly I got . There n't much say . It 's sturdy . It 's adjustable . It 's great price . It really made playing easier . This little foot stool really sturdy . It stays place beautifully . No rocking sideways , wobbly one notches n't , 're screwed : There 's gradual adjustment . But positions allows make sense 99 % players .  This heavy , strong . Very comfortable , I carry around , works well home . I recommend . I like product , wish wider foot base carpeted areas , get little unstable carpet . Does fine hard floors . The reviews foot rest called sturdy well built . They right . It adjusted number different heights suit particular needs - based design stand stay 's put . One best parts stable enough main foot rest I play guitar flat easily fits bag backpack - probably around half thickness chord book , although heavier , steel rubber tread top . It feels like I long time - well priced , good value.Edit2/2013After owning around year using every day I find still looks works like new . I recommend highly . This thing useless . Good idea , way useful . Unless 're constantly aware , 99 % time 'll end kicking go put foot . Pass . This quality construction . It 's definitely must . I 'm taller guy 's important proper posture longer playing periods . I 'm glad I bought . I 've owned several poor quality foot rests past needed new one . This one exceeded expectations price excellent value.I 'm 6 ' 2 weigh 225 . There numerous adjustment angles I switch comfortable I 'm concerned legs bending . The photo makes look weaker . 
692	A Little : I guitar player ( , VERY odd ) years . For first thirty , I tuned ear - starting guessing low E sounded like , tuning five strings fretting , listening tuning . I could never understand tuning often sounded perfect one chord , yet remained ` ' others ... took quite long time get right . Then , ten years ago , I thought I figured . The problem ( I thought ) true `` E '' - I got `` E '' tuning fork ( 320 cycles ) used tune first string . Then , I I always done - fretted tuned five . Not much better result - kept tune retune quite get chords sound right . During years , I tried tuning six strings ( I believed accurately tuned ) piano well ear tones available online . Nothing gave better tuning first try . Then , I saw ad Chromatic Tuner lightening struck.The : There many - led closer I - near perfect tuning first go ` round ! First , I realized say `` E '' , one note . It range literally hundreds - perhaps even thousands- specific tones . The true every note . This akin , I guess , realization child , matter many shades ` blue ' box , chanced precise shade want specific drawing rare . Purchasing first Chromatic Tuner ( , manufactured sold ) moved long way along continuum learning accurate tuning . However , tuner least two limitations . Firstly , 's construction rather light flimsy - works OK , second limitation buy Korg ( price ) That Korg built tone generator speaker allowing option tuning way rather single option tones made instrument read back . Both tuners plug-in electric instruments , , far I tell , similar . I prefer Korg reasons I mentioned . Additionally , Korg manually recalibrated special tuning needs - ` remembers ' original tuning/tones return ` standard ' usage . A nice , extra piece flexibility . The LCD meter easy read colored lights tell , right away , whether sharp , flat ( much ! ) right ! As point surprising interest , tuning fork I used years turns profoundly FLAT ! A shock - given I grown learning tuning forks gave perfect tones ! I saved reminder things promoted . I guess round pitch pipe used tune class 5th grade probably quite precise would presumed ! And Finally : This marvelous little ( inexpensive ) device - well constructed , accurate flexible allow many different tuning need situations circumstances . I assume still higher places ` learning curve ' area rise - right , . I using , regularly , stringed instruments ( two six-string Martins , twelve string Epiphone banjo . The time saves tuning 12-string alone makes 's price ! ) If discovered Chromatic Tuning ( maybe I really WAS last one discover things ! ? ) , I suggest immediately spend time enjoying pleasures making music rather sitting frustration trying adjust tunings ear sounds ` really ' right . Perhaps people ` perfect pitch ' nicely without Chromatic Tuner - I one . Are ? It inexpensive difficult use anywhere used several years backup now.. Nice part calibrate tuning , although probably would used Other I think money would better spent headstock type tuner.. I would recommend . This nice little tuner . It small , easy read use . It non-backlit LCD display analog style meter , extra marks plus minus 20 cents , red LEDs light tone sharp flat . It green LED large mark target . It built-in mic acoustic instruments , mono 1/4 inch phone jack electric instruments . It active tone switch tuning , adjustable narrow range . It uses pair AAA size batteries pop whole case open change . If vision problems , display might issue . The LCD 1 1/2 inches long 3/4 inch high , , like non-backlit LCD displays , narrow viewing angle reflection issues.I wanted tuning I making , works adequately . The one thing lacking disappointed frequency octave readout . As , gives note cents sharp flat , give octave number frequency sound . So , know tuned C , n't know exactly C . Probably much issue tuning regular instrument , cases would handy know . I suppose training experience , I could learn tell ear . ( What ? skill ! Is n't asking bit much ? ) I suppose inexpensive tuner , trade-off , detract usefulness tuner purposes . Other , seems work well . It consistent , easy use , compact . I consider average value - basics well missing I consider important function device . I may expecting much price , I done exhaustive study tuners specs . Having octave feature would make 4 stars instead three.In case , n't need know actual octave frequency accuracy notes tuning , works quite well , expensive . What I really say ! Tunes entire . Cigar Box Guitar , 3 string , Tacoma , brand new Laguna 6 string..Getting ready make Uke 's Tune n one Tuner , buy ? The Korg I 've two tuners . They well known among bass instrument players able lock lowest pitches better tuners . They 're durable long battery life . Unlike tuners , noisy environments n't lock higher pitches lower ones , plus low instrument players.The one problem I 've tuners one set tune pitches tuners recognized . Strange . tuner easy use . I like input jack electric guitar well acoustic . It makes much easier . first tuner long time I 'm please .

695	This top tier condenser mic , well worth 40 dollar price tag . It 2 different pattern modes well gain boost switch . The carrying case also expect MXL even Behringer quality , 's still better condenser , perfect room acoustics live mic'ing . I tested friend recording studio work really good trust price top Seems work well . Like reviewers said , could probably pay 150 get thing . solid construction . getting used attachment . It never stand position like photo . There 's resistance joint flops . Just place upside . Record using headset 'll get much feedback . Just ordered shorter stand . Hope works joint makes stand head . No complaints . I use vocals recording acoustic Pod Studio UX2 . Have tons compliments sound . People ca n't 50 dollar mic I tell . Such fantastic price , ca n't beat . I 'm getting miking recording music , mainly get son good start . I 'm kind feeling way . When I n't getting good result dynamic mic , friend suggested pre-amp and/or condenser mike . I ended getting ( AMP tube pre-amp ) running AMP Tascam DP-008 . WOW ! I work getting levels matched properly , thing SO much cleaner dynamic mics used acoustic guitar . Our music sessions slowed bit ( turned 16 , hanging Old Man LAST thing mind , LOL ) , quality piece equipment seems durable . Includes nice hard plastic , . For kind money , ca n't really go wrong . For money , mic performs well . It sensitive , I hear computer fans background mic . If going use recording make sure quiet room . I also put pop filter . I 've day , I 'll see long run . first real recording microphone . I really like . I use record vocal home studio setup good job After reading reviews around Internet , I took chance since first professional-level microphone . I 'm glad I 's really thing need , though , phantom power unit . I wish I could remember one I got Amazon ( I think $ $ 35 ) worked great . Excellent sound quality , much better mic I 've used . [ Later : The mic indeed Behringer C-1 , Amazon provided description C-1U . Unlike Amazon 's description , mic comes USB plug , phantom power , computer connectivity . And , course , none advertised `` included '' computer software programs included . It 's conventional studio mic requires connection regular amp / P.A . XLR jack phantom power . It NOT connect USB port computer without expensive adapter preamp phantom power . Moreover , Amazon 's form thus far denying refund offering replacement -- presumably another mic like one ! If want described mic , Amazon showing different vendor -- 30 plus S & H . ; ] The Behringer C-1 mic best condenser mic I 've used money , large diaphragm capable reproducing rich deep sonorities costly , high-end mics radio station ( NPR ) I occasionally work . However , Behringer makes distinction C-1 C-1U . The description Amazon fits C-1U , C-1 . So one way another , 50 % purchasers product likely surprised , C-1U phantom-powered mic n't require phantom power , USB port computer . Moreover , mic saves owner bother pre-amp phantom power also makes unnecessary costly ( time-consuming ) XLR USB adapter . It 's ready go -- plug laptop start recording . ( I use Sound Studio , included free software -- Audacity -- works practically well . ) On hand , mic C-1 advertised , prepared receive conventional condenser mic , XLR connector phantom power requirement ( found numerous recording devices P.A . amps available neat little pre-amp sold Amazon , . ) .Having returned keyboard -- M-Audio Pro88sx -- Amazon mistakenly provided wrong description ( M-Audio , Pro88sx ) , I 'd hesitant place mic buyer receive -- C-1 advertised , C-1U described . At least 're purchasing directly Amazon instead sub-vendor , assured hassle-free return . And mistake due Amazon 's description , returns generally postage-free . This microphone deserves positive reviews received . It well made equipment , readily apparent total sound equipment novice like . The item pictured looks different I received ; lighter gray plastic looking body base , 's color metal screw adapter bottom black ( heavy duty plastic ) . Not sure picture showing , actual microphone I received much impressive looking.I initially looking spend ~ $ 125 simple home recording setup using iMac . I ultimately spent $ I moved Behringer mixer board convey appropriate power condenser mic like starting recording , I recommend microphone quality XLR cord disappointed results .

697	Second time buying 6 pack - great deal price . I love colored cables makes set easy . I also like XLR connectors , n't one go bad yet . These cables good quality . I like different colors purposes stage . They good quality , durable . These cables great microphone DI-box applications . They clean electrical noise . Having color coded cables also good . durable flexible looking something nice `` strong '' get cables . For combination color coding high quality cables make great value.It 's cable construction first place . The insulators tough easily nick dragged around rough stages . However , 's attention small construction details I love . The XLR ends quality components , cheap , ill fitting junk companies use keep costs . And unlike cheap ones mate disengage smoothly.Another factor strain reliefs end . Those keep conductors fraying breaking inside cable , often occur cable ends cables without them.Of course color coding godsend . I tell glance connected , live home studio . I experienced extraneous noise using , I careful eliminate sources route around . Still , good cables I purchased.I 'll also admit price initially entered buying decision . I frankly concerned price point would turn junk . Not case . I happily say sometimes really get pay . I JamHub system use rehearsal space . This cable set colour perfectly JamHub colour coding system ! The cables pretty good quality , solid connectors well constructed . The cable bit ' 'slinky ' like higher grade microphone cables , far held fine . The cables add noise signal colour coding makes life rehearsal space much easier . What I say ? GLS makes great product musicians budget ! These cables solidly made , affordable , really easy differentiate mixer . I become fan GLS ! We used three shows bunch practices . Sounds great , looks great , cable tie straps nice connectors fit microphone nice tight . Even fixed another bands vox mic connector , sure cable loose connector , cable tight . Has worked ... SM57 , Nady Starpower , AKG , MXL 990 , Marshall Mark bass amps , every one nice tight clean connection XLR 's numerous mixers . And yes ! These cables solid ; use studio every single day , held well compared many others I 've ordered , $ 70 cables seems like boring way spend money , n't fooled : nothing makes looks stupider recording session blown cable . Not hold sound great , I 've found working complicated studio setup , I 'm always surprised helpful actually ends . For price , totally worth it.I use following really color code studio setup : Color windscreens : GLS Audio Mic Windscreens electrical tape : patch cables : worth ! Makes huge difference ! Picked set cords gig I large hotel event . There 3 audio systems going time running across front two stages . We 48 channels running stages back splitter send inputs board , video mix board , house mix board . I returns subwoofer , 3 monitor mixes stereo main mix . I used different color cable function . I second set DI boxes guitars , bass keyboards . All cables worked perfectly ! The video mix guy asked I got cables could get set . These cords made super easy see bands stuff plugged end night made short work cable tear 2 sets , I ordered one set studio , I find connections much easier ! Great set cables ! I ca n't believe I never thought buying colored cables . I often move microphones one drum set another depending I 'm recording I n't use masking tape write microphone , I look color I 'm set . I 've purchased couple blue 25 foot mic cords seller - . I 've well year used live music least 5 times month . They 've stepped , treated pretty rough . They still supple easy wind . In contrast ; I mic cords different manufacturer set screws fallen , stiffer n't held well . Having cords makes lot easier see channel mixer connected mic . Very inexpensive yet reliable cord . Highly recommended . 
698	Ok , I 'm surprised unit $ . I spent $ 8.59 I 'm mad . It cheap enough I rolled dice see I could get away decent product CHEAP . It feels solid , looks like real direct box ... sounds like ass . I could n't believe Pyle would put much effort great `` fit finish '' product , yet put decent components inside . This piece crap I 've ever used - I ended buying another direct box ( spent $ 60.00 ) . Pyle lived 's name , finish name properly re-brand `` Pyle . `` Sorry folks , I 'd skip one . The 5-star ratings must employees . The reason I didnt ' give one star cheap ( Remember , I spent $ 8.59 ) , I 'm one pulled trigger purchase.Live learn . Why would I think plugging $ 2000.00 guitar cheap piece crap good idea ? My fault . Seem work well . Keep ground switch selected , fine . I used different direct boxes I recommend one . I thought I getting something would signal bass amp . It n't , 's cheap price n't bad I found uses . They make ones boost signal , 's 're looking , careful consumer . I bought band 's primary PA mixer n't high-impedance inputs guitar pickup , I n't always want bring submixer quick-change gigs . So , small , cheap DI box seemed like good solution.The PDC21 no-frills device . It converts 1/4 '' instrument cable ( high Z ) 1/4 '' XLR ( low Z ) signal . It fine job . I n't notice coloring sound ( i.e. , 's changing balance frequencies transmitted ) although lower volume somewhat . That 's expected passive DI box , n't bother me.I 'm using LR Baggs M1A active soundhole pickup . The M1A spits fairly hot signal , I n't problem signal loss associated PDC21 . If I using passive pickup guitar , results might line : 's small , fairly light , seems durable , good job converting active guitar signal XLR inputs PA mixer requires . It everything I wanted , price right . I see reason go shopping expensive one . This passive DI-box great little tool provides attenuation interface line instrument output balanced microphone input . Some notes box attenuation still attenuation . The attenuation sounded funny , probably I used equipment attenuation settings . With attenuation setting , I adjust input volume accordingly . This device also ground lift switch prevent ground loops . All devices I tried internal grounding , I needed ground come mixer . I get hum I would touch case , like I DI-boxes . This product worked well needs . A loud hum crescendo every minutes even ground lifted . Works great intervals though , bad intervals minutes . I bought 4 pcs $ shipped . These well constructed function well . I using tap INSERTS mixer send signal M-audio Fast Track ultra recording . By putting 1/4 '' TS partially mixer ( mixers ) get direct output without actually signal chain . The end 1/4 '' TS cable goes PDC21 I use XLR output connect Fast Track using either XLR XLR XLR TRS cable . My Fast Track like something signal level I fed directly mixer PDC21 mixer , works fantastic . This refernce recording jam-space , studio recording ; works great application.I also used DI box guitar , gear middle line ( junk super high-end ) , I n't notice tone-sucking `` jam-space '' application.I would definately buy . It stopped working 2 gigs . I 'm sure , frustrating . I guess get pay . Grabbed handful units recording kit year . I got three single channels two dual channel units.Set keyboard player ( Dual Channel ) , bass , guitar player DI 's plus one DI output effects module stage connected snake running back venue.Crystal clear sound 4 units straight recording mixing console . I one pop , hiss , crack anything units night . Even able adjust pad setting guitar bass cut signal bit I n't use much compression keep signal clipping going recording.No telling long units last , price , cares , buy another one move boxes sound Band 's YouTube page @ hear sound coming units . studio quality . box missing setup . always getting question , & # 34 ; Can hook keyboard sound board & # 34 ; . Feel good say I capability Ca n't say much description . It 's cheap box works . Nothing fancy everyone . If need box cheap . 
699	These strings I put Taylor GA4E . They nice balanced mids highs . These strings fit nicely acoustic guitarist playing bassist supporting instruments . These strings fill fit acoustic spectrum nicely . Nice mids ringing highs . Not lot bass . But nice balance I said . YMMV . I started experimenting strings , I 'll try using bronze strings . I noticed I using phosphor bronze , started sound dull . When I switched bronze sounded better lasted longer . I decided I would use bronze strings acoustic guitar time . I would recommend others try ! Tried D'Adario Extra Light 12-string set Eko Ranger XII 12-string acoustic , Light 6-string set Takamine . No trouble stringing tuning either set . With Light weight strings I tuned full note lower normal ease string tension , still sound fine . Good acoustic , rather strong metalic , sound nice `` ring '' , notably metalic Phosphor Bronze strings . Sound deaden time , expected , I especially noticed deadening high E B strings , losing `` ring '' . ( Tried Elixir 's better longevity , sound good D'Adario 's . ) I bought strings replace strings Hofner acoustic . The gauge pretty good deeper tone . I might try lighter set next time , good clear tone low high , fairly comfortable . These Reds favorite acoustic strings . These little brighter Reds best live playing . The strings well made I 've never issue quality . 80/20 strings `` blend '' really well cheap Jasmine guitar . They improve bass emphasize tinny sound inexpensive plywood guitars often exhibit . Phosphor Bronze way bright Jasmine . 80/20 good choice guitar needs smoothing . They nothing help 1970 Gibson J-50 , though . Phosphor Bronze strings required give old box snap . Have using years acoustic guitar ... like never issue ... nice bright tone & last long . First time I ordered larger order , Amazon forgot put box . Oops ! I contacted customer support people replacement set strings extra charge . Thank , Amazon ! I like tone D'Addario 's 80/20 bronze strings . I 've playing guitar lately , I 've switched mostly using phosphor bronze , strings great warmth I really enjoy . I also notice electronic tuners much easier time picking notes 80/20 strings.Amazon best price , 're inexpensive enough I afford change strings whenever I feel like . I like tone , react well skin chemistry last long time . Sound subjective strings matter debate go forever . Usually I would n't notice significant difference brands ( except coated string sound like crap ears ) I put D'addarios 000 I could n't believe improvement Martins . It took dozens string changes gage experiments clear . These consistently sound balanced responsive ... With crisp clear highs guitar lacks strung anything else.I 'm glad search awhile I solid sweet baseline experiment ! I love strings ... sound awesome acoustic . However , last long , price pay good sound . Not strings recommended beginners , due bigger gauge . I bought case . I ca n't handle # 12 strings sound # 10 terrible . I prefer # 12 strings finger picking hurt hands . fingers hand wrists , .011 strings I use . I sure get dirty get corrosion main strings I love low price ! ! I many so-called travel size acoustic guitars changed sized strings installed ( typically 12-54 's ) 's ( 11-52 's beefy 7/8 3/4 scale guitars ) cases , brought smaller guitars duds nice playing radical samples come mind : On old Gibson L1 , 12-54 's pulled bridge SX Traveler , could hear Low E I got rid Lil Martin , lower bout started pressure bridge pull.Short scale acoustic guitars someplace full size acoustic Ukulele cases set heavier gauge strings ( even though manufacturers insist delivering way ) due short scales , small frets , light ca n't hear low E , problems fretting strings , try , hurt ?

But I going keep using D'adario Strings . I disappointed . These strings & # 34 ; campfire guitarist & # 34 ; aggressive picking thrilling , tapping , pull offs , sweepers . If tone fanatic keep looking . If guitar deserves best , betray instrument insult tube amp strings . GUITAR . I would n't surprised made China . I guitar setup DR Pure Blues 9 's sound pretty good bit stiff.I 've also noticed bit I must presume nickel coating seems come fingertips practicing hour so.It almost looks like graphite fingers nowhere near `` black '' oxidation I 've seen low-quality strings.They also seem `` string squeak '' changing chords brands - even generously spritzing withFingerease Guitar String qualified say truly give `` vintage tone '' sound , $ 6 I would rather Markley Blue Steel Electric Guitar Strings ( ) save money go withD'Addario Electric Guitar Strings , Super Light , Ball Super Slinky String Set ( 9 - 42 ) seem feel better , I Da-Dairy-O man , . What I say said I used . They rock , roll , greatest ease ; broken , course . If want mellower , stringwith decent sustain try DR Pure decided use 9 's Fender Tele hollow-body company puts 9s guitars.I n't want worry nut wrong size causing untold noises I stuckwith 9s . Hey , uses 7 's ; size matter comes strings tone.The reason Pure Nickels tone ice one get ups . Pure Nickels seem mellow bit . One reason nickel frets ; good thing . Steel wear frets lot faster.I say first set DR Pure Blues went bad weeks . The windings two places string fretted . The reason I kept going back DR I one problem electric guitars ( 4 solid bodies & another hollow-body ) since . Giving DR second chance convinced last 2010 want strings easier bend steel steel core nickels go DR Pure supposed help give vintage tone . This prior strings made nickel . During nickel short supply steel used tomake strings . Or historical theory nickel wrapped steel strings pure nickel strings came back vogue playersbegan searching old vintage sound . To achieve `` vintage '' tone I sure would right amp AND right touch get point . I necessarily looking '' vintage '' tone love easily strings bend long last . Your exact also never anything rub strings onto fingers . The time I get fret board . There usually residual oil left matter much I wipethe fret board . Definitely strings though . I also never heard string-squeak thestrings would give pause either . Any string , even acoustic , squeak occasionally . electric knows pickups set high , nut cut right , wrong sizestring used go ; I experienced DR Pure Blues Nickel Wrap Round strings . I willalso say guitar forums I frequent people giving DR customerservice well strings . So get bum string give . Now get thereand play heart . Oh working `` vintage '' tone fun . I thought something drastically wrong guitar strings , buzzed move much hit every metal every fret . I read good reviews strings around web bought set locally price . I usually use DR Fits , made change good They lot mids bass make great chunky blues classic rock sound P90 's . I also used set single coil stray cigar box guitar I built give lot resonance life old box cheapo pickup . I buy another set , DR strings never disappoint .

Sure , could spend `` boutique '' specialty strings give exact `` vintage '' sound , strings fine whether play bedroom , garage like light guage .010 's easy fingers , still beefy sounding compared thin sounding .009 's 's . These go-to strings . They perfect gig use inexpensive well awesome sounding . What need ? I love strings . They bright feel really good hands.I Gretsch use 11 's D'addario , best strings I 've found far . I also bought pack half wound 11 's TRY . I 'll decide use ( round half wound ) experiment . I bought strings try guitars . They sound good variety models , like SG , Les Paul , Rickenbacker . They melodic tone good intonation , seem lasting staying good shape . I 've trying different gauges experiment different fretboard feels . These strings I say , stretched stayed tune much faster slinkys . They great sustain sound nice chunky . I love luster shine new strings , feels nice ans springy . Since first time brand , I n't know long stay good , 'll see . Put Schecter C-1 Custom Drop Bb , strings sound great great low end . Highly reccomend . I started buying strings guitar playing son back December 2012 continue day . He absolutely swears . He go fairly quickly humidity Hawaii makes prone rusting . Other , strings strong durable gives nice sound quality . He highly recommends strings fellow guitar players . I used strings since first came . D'Addario make best strings . I sure others good job , actually hear difference . It n't really matter buy - sound different - better ! ! Obviously n't top line strings I used record track drop C sounded awesome . After week started losing tone started collecting skin.D'addario awesome keep mind 're cheaper side . I 've purchased locally several times past three years music store . Mainly due low cost . They work okay , difficult keep tune . The guitars re-tuned often temperature , humidity , playing ten minutes occurs . My biggest complaint tarnish corrosion . Add winding separating fret bars exposing inner solid string , strings go `` flat '' sounding . These quality strings , cheap Chinese Made quality . They okay someone n't play often , play daily performer , avoid strings . Better strings worth extra cost . You actually save money replace often cheap strings . I 've problem D'Addario brand strings , electric acoustic , 6 12 string guitars . The thinner gauge strings break tuning playing . The tarnish corrosion often ends fret bars keeping neck dirty time . Cleaning playing session makes strings corrode faster . I using D'adario strings 30 years . They sound great . They stay tune . Excellent sustain . I get better string control compared strings . I never experienced string break 30 years . I swear strings . These strings I use Les Paul . Their bright tone sounds great full , color coded ball ends makes restringing breeze . Do n't buy strings I like , buy suit . Because like tone provide . Because feel good fingers . Cons ? ? What cons ... ? ? Try . Excellent guitar strings - last long time , sound great pretty cheap . I absolutely love using strings ( 10-46 ) Telecaster Stratocaster . They lend awesome Vintage tone seepage people like go nuts . If 're looking replacement set strings , simply go wrong EXL sets Amazon . These excellent , inexpensive guitar strings . They perfect somebody plays gigs changes strings frequently . For casual player , might best choice.For gigging musician , nothing better D'Addario strings . They light weight , great sound , inexpensive . These might take slight nod Ernie Ball strings.For casual musician , somebody n't changing strings week , probably great choice . Personally , I use Elixir strings electric guitars , Les Paul 2008 Standard Gibson Lucille . I play gigs , set strings n't see hour two really hard playing per night . The coating Elixir 's helps keep corrosion easier fingers ; I like feel bit better strings . I get month playing strings . Sadly , D'Addario strings really good one two weeks playing.I 've tried variety strings , Ernie Ball , Elixir , D'Addario , guitars way I play , Elixir 's sound play best . Of course , mileage may vary . If I start play gigs , I would probably switch affordable string like these.A silly cosmetic thing , I hate packaging strings . D'Addario makes huge deal reduced packaging environmentally responsible products . The strings come cardstock outer box , single plastic package inside . Each string size different colored ball end help person figure string gauge . I change strings , I really prefer individual paper envelopes strings , gauge clearly printed package . If new changing strings , change infrequently , one package confuse heck . Especially first , I preferred work one string time.D'Addario also makes major deal serial number package help fight fake strings . Their website place enter serial number verify package stings authentic . I kind disliked fact enter email address even get started . They could simply left spot enter serial number information end , silly colored balls end strings , well look goofy guitars . I would n't mind colors acoustic ( ball gets hidden peg anyway ) , balls visible electric guitar . I prefer simple gold balls ends strings . I always used D'Addario strings . Since early 70 's I first found manufactured right Long Island . I 've never disappointed quality . What say best best . I would n't use anything else guitar get best tonal quality . These strings seem last longer others I 've used . I highly recommend . My Strat bigger frets guitar I ever owned , I tendency sharp notes played thinner gauges , particularly 3rd string . This 11 49 set feels like acoustic guitars minimizes problem sharp notes much finger pressure , still feeling `` faster '' acoustic guitar . They sound great , last long time , stay tune good compromise light gauges really heavy sets . I read reviews bought 6 pairs based reviews.So , I put Gibson Les Paul last night played hours . I n't hammer strings , played easy , mostly I hanging guitar wall afterward , I took quick look strings . I shocked see high E B strings already flattened . I never would expected wear hours light playing.The strings sounded great , time I stretched enough would hold tune , already worn.I guess I 'm going HAVE go heavier strings I 'm changing strings every days . These perform 3 stars generous . I 5 sets use , damn . I using light gauge thought mediums would hold , lasted two hours ... ... Fender 3250L bullets least lasted weeks . Going try Fender Gibson see sound . I 'm still search `` perfect '' set strings . I 'm open suggestions I decided give try buying earnie balls . Wow ! Just wow ! My inexperienced ear able tell difference sound . It ... Right . I ca n't explain exactly . The .10 gauge great standard eb tuning , although tuned lower . I would recommend something thicker though . But great get em ! I played D'addario Before , actually first string I started light 's ok , wear real fast , So , It 's put much stess ... You alot tricks , pinched 's vibrato 's , extreme bend 's , etc break . Any skilled guitarist know 's use extream caution tuning ... strings , I try extra light ( soud nice , nice feel ) I would recamend beginer 's , cause beginer 's tend press hard , first stat , I n't like D'addario 's , I find tone bright . These strings prefect feel awesome . As tell amount reviews product extremely popular.. people wrong Some say `` '' , `` '' , `` '' , `` '' Others shorten `` '' even `` Daddy-O 's '' . Took figure last one out.I trying find info `` Daddy-O strings '' people thought great . people may disagree say name , debate idea great strings . * Less expensive string sets , especially buy make string changes Easy find vendor music store* Made You collect `` players points '' They sealed special `` environmentally friendly '' package keep fresh They one widest range string-size combinations starting know put new guitar phrase `` set '' `` put Da-Dairy-O '' '' good choice , least strat tele-like guitar.I personally like better Ernie Ball Super Slinkys aka `` EB '' , I quite put finger `` '' .You pay coated strings , frozen strings , boutique strings , know probably n't playing long enough find value them.Almost every guitarist set strings `` swear '' work wonders string - make play smoother faster , last set strings lasted 6 years , whatever.I appreciate great value , D'Addario strings that.BTW , record official pronunciation `` Da-Dairy-O '' : > > `` We receive letters week regarding correct pronunciation D'Addario name . Some years back , even ran ad easy way pronounce D'Addario name . The name pronounced follows : Da-Dairy-O . A simple way pronounce difficult name musical accessories ! '' I enjoy much ! Very good strings ! It 's good brand ! I recommend acoustic ! Hold tune well , sound good . The seem bit less tension brands strings gauge , thats dont wipe playing , wont last long . But I always , I change strings often , isnt issue , best strings available . I 'm starting electric guitar told best . I like light strings fingers still decent sound . The price right . Not much say , basic hex core , nickel plated round wound strings . They equivalent Ball Slinkys ( Yellow ) They play nice , feel pretty much humble ( musician 's ) , 's nice strings coming air tight packaging keep fresher rust free longer . As note come packed together single bag , color coded washers , ( opposed EB sets packed individually paper sleeves DR sets come two sleeve . ) In summary , 're searching subtle sonic differences brands probably n't reading review , 're experimenting . For others , seem like good strings definitely worth checking see ones prefer . I using brand several different gauges many years . I get long life good clarity D'Addarios . These n't usually go-to strings , D'Addarios good , solid sounding string . They last fairly long taken care , n't usually break often . I DO like sound kind bright without overbearing . They continue 2nd string choice , 've failed time I 've purchased . Definitely recommended . These great alternative phosphor bronze transatlantic cables acoustic guitar ! I would rather concentrate making music . Why fight guitar ? My son guitarist seven years loves strings . Not single one broken since started using three weeks ago . These strings tend repel dirt dust even heavy play strings look good . He getting less fingers . The tone produced stings good especially considering low price . My son heavy hand strings well made withstand play style . The gauges identical Ernie Ball ( yellow label ) D'Addario 's string tension feels stiffer , nice slide playing . I like action , comfortable straight playing bending , solid intonation chords , yet much fret rattle slide.I usually stretch heck Ernie Ball 's putting much spring . I deliberately left D'Addarios unstretched overnight found settled nicely without much stretching . Their new sound quite bright advertised , far less I call ` new string jangle ' , fine . As kid , I 'd sweat hour days , playing number instruments , last 's string tension chart , handy designing custom set pack serial number . I 'll admit I 'd never considered possibility guitar strings worthwhile targets , apparently 's case D'Addario provides web site verify set . If come across , 're willing report , 'll provide genuine replacement 've used D'Addario phosphor-bronze acoustic strings guitars mandolins 25 years swear quality consistency . I 've used Ernie Ball 's electrics even longer . tough break , playing rock roots , I find interesting experiment different gauges windings . Finally sound feel 've chasing years makes worth . I ended settling favorite strings years ago . Ultimately , 're simply best money . You get less $ 3 per pack , shop around . These perfect strings gig long practice session . The strings keep tone long time . Can easily last upto month daily practice 2-3 hours . I used d'addario number years . I 'm hot acoustic , electric ... 're whole new world . I like nickel tele ... give extra twang . I used D'Addario strings years Gibson Les Paul sound GREAT . Had stint I tried coated strings Paul n't ringing bright tone D'Addarios . I 've never one strings break often , guess I n't play heavy-handed , I many friends still use find reliable . They tone Dean 's Slinky 's IMHO . I much recommend strings anyone plays electric guitar styles - I used rock , country , jazz , fusion contemporary gigs . Very dependable . The set usually lasts couple shows I change - like string lose brightness couple gigs . Strings claiming last longer tone , opinion , usually somewhat lifeless begin . Anyway ... great threads ole geetar - never used try ... good stuff . As I stated guitar strings I purchased , D'Addarios electric guitar give sound , service price point I need ! great strings , last well ! 've never problem 'm glad get decent price . I 've using D'Addario XL strings since 80s . I love 'em . The 10 pack price amazing . The best strings I ever bought I 've bought . I got electric acoustic electric acoustic . They really full sound , bright highs , bend like crazy . Folks , I 've tried Dean Markley Ernie Ball . All good bad points . But 22 years guitar playing , D'Addario still makes best electric guitar strings money . Although I prefer super light top , regular bottom version , I always loved feel , tone durability D'Addario strings . I purchasing strings 15 years . Only string I allow touch electric guitars . Been using years . I like Regular Slinkies , , seems tend last longer . Or , could head . Either way , I happy . I 've playing nearly ten years I 've used sorts strings many different guitars , I 've ball ends pop reason , ball ends rolling around bottoms containers I 've bought new , lot unnecessary string breakage fast corrosion , ( top brands ) I also overpaid fancy gimmicks strings supposed give magic tones . Then I tried D'addario , work work well , I 'm asking anything magical I need I need I need string never failed deliver , I 've using three years I n't know I n't give shot sooner , I could saved lot money trying first . Bottom line strings job without drama , giving time play ! These bright sounding strings easy play , hold well rarely break . One favorite strings Les Paul . I tend go Ernie Ball Super Slinky 's Strat , would probably sound nice Strat well . The price definately main draw , I glad I placed order , people pleasant work ! ! ! ! ! This second order 10 pack . A local store wants one set . The feel really good opinion opposed brands I 've tried ; including , especially commonly used eb 's . I however slight issue certain D strings . On occasion , looks winding chipping , frets . I change strings quite often really n't matter . Not sure 's n't affect anything like I said IS second order I gave 5 stars . Any less I 'd look dumb . I 've using strings guitars last 30+ years . They always give consistent results . I consider one greatest bargains . I love strings , using forever via Amazon Save I get really good price . I n't give 5 stars I know better strings , strings great value would n't hesitate buy . In fact , I already bought several times . One little thing I appreciate strings different colored ends makes easy identify . For good , basic set regular light gauge electric guitar strings , 's difficult go wrong D'Addario 's EXL110s . The range thicknesses generally works well , D'Addarios tend pretty consistent . Some brands may offer special features go beyond get EXL110s ( e.g . coating , super brightness , ) , players prefer slightly heavier slightly lighter gauge string ( e.g . sets start 9s 11s ) , purposes work great , hold tuning well , seem last pretty well , . The D'Addario sets good stuff . I got turned onto decade ago . The color coded ends great whether new changing strings want automated old veteran . With stretching , stay tune fine . The unknown truth strings ( maybe even , ) handful string makers , D'Addario actually makes companies ( Gore uses Elixir series , adds polyweb coating ) . I also use GHS standard .010 sets , good . My faves Ernie Ball sets , rarely go sale . I n't remember makes strings companies , though . With offshore production standard thing , 's telling actually come anyways . I GFS strings production , instance . In opinion , D'Addario standard strings measured . I keep trying different brands cheap boutique , I always keep coming back D'Addario . Extremely versatile , stable last long reasonably expected non coated string . These strings good . Nice tone , last decent amount time , 're cheap . Color coded make easy string without pay much attention . I use electric guitars , I used Dean Markley 11-52 ( mostly Les Paul scale ) - I moved I got strat-scale guitar . I n't remember I picked , cheap readily available everywhere , Dean Markley hit miss . These strings n't everyone , probably want everyday , normal playing . But 're looking string bright sound , string . In addition putting guitar , I also six-string banjo ( guitar tuning ) could n't get sound I wanted regular guitar strings . Light guage nickel strings recommended , exactly I looking . They clear , bright sound great picking strumming . I play lot bluegrass Irish music , I feel strings ideal purpose . I use lot D'Addario strings various instruments , I think offer terms quality tone . You pay , I n't think get much . Although intended electric guitar , also work well resonator guitars .

They hold tone & tuning longer others I 've tried , buy bulk packs ca n't go wrong quality + value . After tons experimenting , I settled EXL116 D standard E flat standard . I 've tried top little floppy D makes notes sound tune n't press string right . Also tried 11-56 gives real solid full rhythm tone , attack rounded due pick taking longer travel wider string . That reduces articulation . So get fuller sound , get dynamics attack 52 , latter makes metal rhythms sound heavier . You EQ fullness rhythm track , ca n't add pick attack greater wise , D standard 11-56 ideal 11-52 doable . Sound wise , 11-52 best metal recordings 's I 'm sticking EXL116 set . I also replaced G string 20 gauge wound better sounding power chords . And compared Ernie Balls , D'addarios start less bright maintain brightness longer , thus even predictable response time .

But looking buttery soft fine leather gold stitching , need understand 'll pay . If want one made Leather Free Range , 'll need hitch ride . If want solid deal basic leather strap wo n't let , safe bet . Oh tight strap button holes ? That 's good thing universe , gravity often time travel ( Planet , anyhow ) . Nice strap money . I ordered black got brown . Nice solid frills guitar strap . I used stupid heavy Agile guitar helped lot . I bought strap I wanted draw sharpie cover clear coat preserve sharpie . This good sized strap nice drawing surface . My plan worked , good quality strap . And good price . Good leather good build , made last age nicely . I like leather best things feels proper , I like simple let guitar stand , keep strap simple elegant . I ordered two based review indeed , guitar strap deserves 5 stars.It feel like leather I 100 % true leather . However , 10 $ piece , I give 5 stars.I used nylon straps twist easily . This one twist , saves lot times , especially gigs.I order two ( I 4 different kind guitars , acoustic , classical , electric bass ) , fit . Like many others pointed , good leather strap good price made Canada . It simple design , plenty long enough taller average player , solidly made , notice low price ? I looked leather straps time , could never pull trigger ordering one sticker shock price . Most straps I seen guitar stores quality start $ 30+ price category . I justify spending $ 30 $ 50 overpriced version guitar strap fancy brand name label better quality . This strap barely expensive cheap nylon strap ! ( A nylon strap may work adequately lacks real sense style ) Also , name brand straps two inch three inch wide , 2-1/2 inch wide strap right me.I like strap much I placing order one every colour I find use guitars !

I bought anyway , hoping would decent product , unfortunately , upon receiving , I almost immediately disappointed quality strap appears 100 % leather , n't piece junk , n't appear high quality . The leather thin soft , I would surprised , edges soon begin curl , strap begins wrinkle . I n't expect leather around holes strap nuts , hold well long term . If use strap , probably want use kind strap locking system.I leather straps lasted ten years . The leather thicker stiffer , resisted fraying along edges . While leather developed cracks , still holding fine , chance strap tear . I could wrong , looking Planet Waves strap , I doubts hold anywhere near well casual player , strap probably fine , although strap locks recommended . The leather may start curl deform , strap certainly n't going fail immediately . While serviceable , serious players , aggressive style playing , might want spending little better quality leather strap . I decided keep strap , installed secondary guitar I n't play much .

The called lower priced brother enormous Line 6 FBV MKII pedal , cut still lot features . Same quality build . powered attached line 6 modeling amp ( real nice feature ) . One less power supply hook . Foot switches easy use . Built tuner works great . The volume/wah pedal switching requires little effort old pedal still job nicely firm forward press . pedal really allows fine tune four amp `` sounds '' instantly available play ( either home stage ) . Before I purchased FBV I scoured web see works POD HD Desktop , even advanced users guide leaves thinking..Anyway , I lucked found used one going cheap , time figured exactly POD HD desktop & FBV Express II . First , setup screen NOT enable FBV Express . Yes , I know sounds dumb , internet scouring shows bug workaround ... 2 . Read FBV Express users guide calibrate pedal.. need FBV software this.Now.. In POD setup screens option either ABCD buttons ABCD , FS5-FS8 . This behavior 4 switches In ABCD mode : ) Select preset A , B , C D group currently ) Insert volume FX use volume pedal ... ) Insert another FX enabled toe switch , controlled pedal ) tap temp ( tapping currently selected preset..ie pedal lit ) e ) enable tuner ( press/hold current selected preset pedal ) f ) basic control looper , CAN NOT enable EDIT : Looper control flawed . You record go overdub , record play/stop stop overdub start loop . seemingly acknowledged unfixed enough , like , switching presets way way less useful switching FX blocks & . combine blocks one pedal ( say ) turns OD , delay & chorus , turn one amp one ( channel switching ) .. ! ! cry , sounds like NO ABCD mode FS5-FS8 ! yup mode , ) 4 sets block ( ) using four ) use volume expression options ( ie like volume wah , overdrive level , delay etc ) c ) basic control looper BUT enable looper control flawed stated ) enable tuner ? ... oh sod . nope ) tap tempo ? .. nope summary , Express better nothing , certainly provide hands free operation shortboard worth extra , reading buying pod.. get HD500x instead . This essential accessory excellent Line 6 Spider IV combo amps , For details , see review Line 6 Spider IV 75 watt combo . The FBV Express Mk II least expensive pedal give one full control basic essential amp features . This pedal ( ) included amp n't . Anyway , considering buying amp ( great ) , really want pedal , even though costs 33 % price amp FBV Express Mk II store 4 amp channels , settings model effects , well control 14 second looping ability Spider IV . The pedal also adds volume/way pedal ( wah pedal OK Cry Baby stand-alone wah wahs ) . Without pedal , able access looping channel switching real time playing ( whole point thing ) unless standard compliment 2 arms , equipped one hand pedal also interfaces computer allow deep editing storing effects Line 6 Spider IV combos USB port . This feature alone makes must-have taking full advantage . Tepper This foot controller wonderful switch four channels volume pedal wah pedal built tuner makes complete package line 6 amp ! ! ! This thing works wonders . If anyone performs live someone happens switch channels alot I recommend . I hate let go guitar switch channels , perfect job . The pedals easy press I love volume/wah pedal . I use volume , I already wah pedal . The tuner works amazing well . I also love fact connects amp via cable . I use spider iv 75 works great I 've 2 months issues . I really like foot controller n't reach amp time change channels . I wish big USB cable ca n't find Walmart . This used make annoying clicking sound 's gone . Anyway , thing nice 're lazy reach amp change channels . I think product around $ .

712	I 've little amplifier weeks I could n't ask better practice amp . It 's amazing loud gets otherwise quiet room , 'll get drowned pretty quickly add competing sounds . It 's rugged portable , 's fun play around effects . The fact runs batteries huge plus . Might work well recording take output jack . Speaker acceptable quality ca n't compared Fender amp one 5 watts small speaker watts . I 'm opting convenience size . I got getting couple smaller amps headphone monitor plugs since better sound good effects . I like ' setting . I sound like rock star . Good product practice recording . You could get away microphone amplify gig . But around price could get Fender amp . This product works quality pretty good . Other mini amps similar accessories toys compared . There several types practice amps . High end ( Line 6 , G , Vox VT ) still run $ 400+ typically overloaded features . The low end tubes ( Fender Blues Junior , Bug V22 , Peavey Valveking , etc ) . These typically stripped ( features , quality ) . And micros . I always thought notch toys , sort amps found prepackaged guitar set World I wrong ... I needed portable amp son take practice school . It important could schlepp gear . He 's big kid , even . amps pushing ( plus gig bag school back pack ) . That initially brought Micro . Not sound features , smallest possible amp little virtuoso . Turns AMAZING amp . The tone destroys Line 6 features crush Vox Pathfinder ( ? ) Bug . And Fender - even models distinct . The cleans sparkly ( trebly ) high gain models articulate . Obviously n't loud amp , 's bad . You get everything amp offer reasonable volumes . It also battery powered ( life suprisingly long ) , includes regular wall plug , headphone jack , built tuning fork ( kind lame ) series onboard effects run simultaneously . For example , I able crank delay tremelo pull Dick surpher licks suprising n't let size fool . I honestly thought nothing toy I could n't wrong . There several big websites 's tough find negatives amp . Quality sounding durable great price.Oh - red - find - looks pretty sweet . Great little amp . I take Ampeg Jet maintenance I love little practice amp . I enjoy using Fender Strat Rickenbacker . It fun little practice amp , I agree praise gets . The positives covered I 'll point ( minor ) things I n't like.First power button back , annoying . The rest controls top , I around back find important button . Plus I keep cabinet I pull turn ! I wish 'd name settings & # 34 ; clean & # 34 ; , & # 34 ; overdrive & # 34 ; , & # 34 ; distortion & # 34 ; , . Clean , Black Panel , Brit combo mean nothing 's another minor annoyance input recessed . A 90 degree angle plug wo n't fit unless run around , amp solid rugged means 's heavy . Not heavy like I ca n't pick , heavy something called micro deal breakers , things I find annoying . Overall I say I prefer VOX mini 3 . I bought amp replace Squier came guitar . The Squier effects , clean channel overdrive button . I could n't afford bunch pedals , I wanted effects I could get cool sounds electric guitar . I saw reviews little amp Amazon decided give try . It Awesome ! For small amp , output plenty loud practicing home , runs batteries , , I take anywhere . The effects better I 'd hoped . This certainly pro performs onstage drummer , intermediate level guitarist ( like ) plays pleasure please family , amp get . It several modeling functions choose chorus , flanger , phaser , tremelo still adding either reverb delay . I 'm one growing number retirees decided pick guitar learn I time . I n't need stacks kids like . I love amp . This pupppy pretty powerful running batteries . We 've used couple gigs worked well volume half way . We guitar players using guitars . We using mp3 player backup . The sound quite clear get Roland ( 4 stars ) . The micro cube lot easier transport set 's nice load cart roll around . Guitar folk like unit fx features . The came new AC Adaptor supports . Now I take along use saved $ 30 buying another AC adapter supports Customer !

714	I using Dunlop picks long time . Good feel , grip heavy thick . Good deal . I prefer nylon picks softer feel strings ear - less `` clicky '' - standard plastic pick . My favorites Snarling Dogs Brain Picks similar . I guess comes right essentially , I Brain Picks point , I use . But Dunlop nylon picks excellent . They 're almost impossible drop , sound feel right , last seemingly forever . Hard go wrong like nylon picks . I ca n't hear sounds strings flick flimsy picks across . better electric guitar still hard play fast Ever since I started playing guitar , I 've used nylon Dunlop picks . They 're better thicker size ( 1.0mm larger ) .73mm size thickness regular Fender pick . They 're flexible easy pick , biggest plus nylon picks NOT break . You 'd almost melt one things lighter harm -- one pack last yeeeeears.Also note : price keeps going Amazon reason -- n't pay $ 3-4 pack , get local music store . I bought I wanted durable , flexible picks easy strumming . I would recomend anyone needs stable strumming . I like thin picks , one VERY thin . You won'tuse time , every used right situation . If player somewhat comes playing needs take edge , ideal . Also , soft strumming acoustic guitar , awesome . No power chords little guy , good tool tool box need . The texture 's grippy textured surface Dunlops I love , makes easier hold . I give thumbs ! They 're great . Awesome chord based songs . If need pick individual , might want go bit thicker . With said , , tone nice ( sounds bit softer ) . I bass player I like picks bit thicker wider . I tend Play Fender I pleasantly surprised I found pick worked really well . I would give picks five stars , I couple types I prefer . Still , nice picks . So far I 've used 12-string guitar , I 'll soon trying 6-string guitars . They 're thin nylon picks . They 're good practicing hand strumming ; put little resistance , train keep hand stable . I still sometimes play since give really nice bright tone , I usually want something thicker order able melody lines strums . I also sometimes use practicing flatpicking , since flatpicking really thin pick reveals things body mechanics n't notice thicker 're great ( thin , flexible picks ) , Amazon best price . cant go wrong Dunlop pick , last n't break . end losing verses breaking . This .38 mm bit soft liking , go size thicker next time~ These n't right feel sound n't great compared quality control . The picks n't cleanly cut injection molded result left thin trim around them.I 'll stick Dunlop Gator Grip PRS 1.0 picks . For flexibility acoustic , I prefer Fender Medium Celluloid picks . yes , think try . 're looking , get . thin flexible purchased develop pick skills finger type guy w/o pick experience . n't drop get feel sting located w/o looking . These favorite picks , decades . They grip well , last forever , 're tiny bit muted , & # 34 ; & # 34 ; picks . I 've used .60mm .73mm Dunlop Nylon picks entire professional music career . I rock hard . Acoustic , electric , Bass ! I 've tried almost every pick market break far easily . Dunlop 's Nylon picks n't break , find thickness fits needs , 'll find excellent string attack easily kept grip . I rarely ever drop one picks preforming . Maybe 5 times entire career . Buy picks . Im loyal brands whole I reach pick I hope one I get . They wear get nicks I remember keep ordering them.Edit : Watch Steve Vai interview shares secret restoring edge worn , nicked , picks . , firmly wipe pick edge carpet . The motion trying cut carpet edge pick , repeat 3 4 times whadda u know ! The edge smooth nice . I 've using Dunlop almost long I 've playing guitar ( twenty one years ) . I find .60 's bit thin , chord strumming style playing , playing rhythm , .73 's perfect . They flexible , flimsy . The tips wear picks . I estimate solid thirty forty hours playing 'll get pristine tip . However , 're definitely still usable . One advantage picks never break . So , dont see go wrong . These Dunlop 88 mm picks right size , big small . Been using years . Always good extras hand put cases . They never wear . They stiff flimsy . They work good sound strings . Easy hold . I ordered I bought variety pack picks Musician 's Friend one thin celluloid pick pack . I loved quieted strumming acoustic dreadnought , I went hunt thin picks . The celluloid one fell apart quickly , I wanted better white nylon picks last lot longer . The end grippy ( textured ) , n't work great like use rounded corners pick , job I like . The pointed end thin slides strings nicely , still pick 're combining picking strumming.I 'll keep using thicker picks songs louder strumming , mellow strumming keep bothering folks house , : I 've using year , pretty flimsy picking notes song ... . This still favorite pick strumming . Hope helps . OK , picks personal thing guitarists . I 've playing 30 years used many different brands types pick . There 1 perfect pick everything , depending playing playing style 'll want choose different thickness materials . However , I found line pick favorite general goto pick . My hands sweat textured grips fantastic job keeping pick hand floor . I also really like Nylon material . It produces softer sound without dampening overall sound volume guitar . I like playability .88mm great strumming rhythm loud volume picking blues . I Keep stack .60mm raw , folk like sound . In case picks great staple kit many many years continue . These picks nylon , one last couple years ( long n't lose ! ! ) thicker .60mm , dig strings little better , still hair flimsier Snarling Dogs .73mm picks ( I know , 're size , trust & # 34 ; flimsier & # 34 ; ) , grip ok. You ca n't go wrong . alright I got tired forking 30 cent pick local guitar store instant gratification decided get online , let tell , picks get job done . n't expect playing metal soft side work well casual playing along heavy palm mutes stuff like . tips broke I think 's fault playing hard : ) Great picks , would recommend anyone . I use Dunlop .60mm nylon picks current standard , decided give lighter .38mm try . Unfortunately , volume produce get completely swallowed accompanying singing acoustic guitar ( especially outdoor setting ) , basically unusable purpose . However , I find ticket personal practice , allowing hear metronome far easier . So although failed original performance intention , 5 stars filling need I n't even know I . : ) This nylon pick great play feel . It stiff enough pick individual strings still feels comfortable stumming chords . like kind picks grip , normal picks use slip fingers times hate droping pick playing , get .

I 'm thinking picking another classical mandolin ... It 's definitely high-tech , since I n't vintage mandolin , I n't really care looks . My primary concerns comfort function , product gets five stars counts . I really like fact attach contact points , using click-locks , remove strap instrument leaving contact points place . Also , get strap twisted installing , undo click-locks , take twist , reattach . Pure function ! This strap well designed thought-out going manufacture . Five stars ! As others said , stretchiness strap makes instrument seem much lighter I less likely get shoulder playing long periods time . It may take tries different configurations extensions get right instrument , n't give , 's worth effort . 
718	I bought cheep violin decide I would like playing pegs kept slipping . The peg drops really helped keep tune I would n't able without drops . Ca n't play instrument wood pegs without small bottle Peg Drops . Though I n't know n't put guitar type turners violins , bases I Violin 's sparked 11 year interest . My pegs great shape I figured I 'd get oil make starting play violin easier . Got stop pegs slipping cheap new violin . Added couple drops , worked like charm . A must buy anyone buying cheap starter violin . I given violin ( fiddle ) friend decided would never really learn play . The violin n't used quite time pegs really loose would n't tune . I got product see I could fix problem . It worked said would . A drop two peg tightened enough able tune violin.Now 's played regularly 's easier tune , know pegs get loose I product fix problem . Wow , works ! At first , I little wary using Original Peg Drops pegs warnings came product . Being teacher , fear I could damage finish rather inexpensive instrument . However , I needed help tuning couple pegs , I closed eyes ahead ( 's figure speech ; I careful , using stuff first time ) . With care , cotton small rag ( torn eaten underwear ) I went ahead , willing try anything . I even removed strings pegs ( one time - starting inner one first ) , put drops proper peg locations restrung string . Tuning became breeze . To think I used great glob practice time , fiddling , tuning . ! Could ' veggie drink ! These drops convenience . In opinion beginning violinists . If reading wondering consider buying product stop tuning pegs slipping , make turn smoother less dramatic tuning jumps , answer yes . Buy , work , works well.Even though instructions said put drop two different places peg , I wanted go light case , first I put 1 drop peg . I n't know expect always put , much could bad thing . Also , instrument different , peg different . I one stubborn peg , others normal level obnoxious slipping . You may need 1 drop pegs reccomended 2 drops others . I new strings , course going take forever stretch need constant tuning . I remove strings , I loosened pegs little pulled tiny bit , one time , put first drop spot peg would make contact put back ( tuning head side peg , part actually turn ) . I put 2nd small drop dead end peg ( end turn ) . Be careful applying n't get 1 small drop time . This stuff spreads time , tiny drop goes long way . One bottle last long time.What expect : With one drop effect immediate . You notice pegs turn smoother hold position much better . After playing awhile I decided put 2nd drop peg ( suggested included instruction sheet ) . This helped stay place even better . The pegs also turn smoother easier I tune much easier , smaller accurate adjustments , strings actually hold tuning much longer product . Buy , use , happy . My pegs giving difficulty , temperamental subject slipping long I remember . I 'd guess 100 years wear them.I used able deal . Violin teachers techs I knew never suggested pegs problem . More recently , I tried adding fine tuners G D A make easier tune , resultant shortening strings affected sound much . I figured I 'd give drops try . The change immediate . I able work pegs easily , slippage went away immediately . I decided give 24 hours changing strings . When I , I also removed three fine tuners still control I changing one string , things worked well , I peg slip suddenly . I figured I 'd try retuning perhaps fault , ended slipping loose . I tried reapplying peg drops , seemed fix problem . After , I slippage , I one peg instructions clear minimal open ended . I n't expect tell exactly often use drops could given bit info expect , symptoms indicate , forth . I tried contacting manufacturer brief questions , never heard say drops made incredible difference , provide instant cure . I 'd definitely recommend , I hope get comments users experience I better idea makes people know 's time reapply experience it.The advantage good peg control get high quality gut synthetic ( metal core ) strings able tune precisely without tonal problems introduced fine tuners . The effort I without drops made avoid playing I using Yamaha time . That fun , I n't realize much I missed richness old acoustic violin stayed tune . 
719	This acoustic pickup amazing thing ever . It warm soft tone picks notes well . I could n't happier purchase . It 's good investment play guitar n't electric acoustic . I n't think I 'll ever even buy electric acoustic since I thing . sounds better anyway ! ! I bought daughters acoustic guitar could play amp . It fits well sounds great ! This mic fine . One know quite low gain requires use guitar sound heard . quiet , almost hum free - clear respose - volume control n't use record & play thru PA either I someone else keeps volume control . It tends bass heavy , slight eq revisit compensates . I used one past , solid unit & fits movement free soundhole guitar & also two others use . great job . great value . got quick nice little carry bag & I update problems come later - n't see tho Could get fit small sound hole . Once sound hole pickup work . Would buy . I 've owned Seymour Duncan Woody several months , chance try various amps , pickup tipped stronger low end high end , . This excellent value basically feedback free 're likely get acoustic guitar pickup . The one thing I 've found I get significantly natural acoustic guitar sound playing Woody Ampeg bass amp Peavey guitar amp . The high ends grating electric guitar amp 's tendency distortion creep , even clean setting . Through bass amp , though , tone absolutely clean clear . The pickup easy enough install remove 's easy get sit low enough n't interfere finger picking sound hole pickup would . The great feature pickup look ; natural wood finish actually enhances look guitar . If looking acoustic guitar pickup , one buy ! I bought Martin D-18 recording PC . So far working great . I Behringer 802 mixer already I plugged guitar . It works perfectly . This guitar loud without pickup , get sound PC recording I either needed use mike pickup . I chose pickup . I got much background noise : I started get loud buzz sound system scratched head bit trying figure . I played guitar hour without `` buzz '' problem . I discovered I turn guitar certain way buzz went away . Then I remembered thing I differently I turned another overhead light since dark outside . I turned light buzz went away . My pickup picking interference new type florescent bulbs light . I 'm glad nothing really wrong pickup . ; ) After using pickup awhile I noticed 5th 6th strings n't loud I would expect ; also 2nd string louder strings . I 'm sure . It 's big deal . The pickup nice pretty easy use plastic thing wrapped around cable really annoyed . How heck supposed take without damaging cable ? Anyway , pickup sounds nice 'm happy . This pickup . I 've six years . Good sound throughout spectrum - full lows bright highs , without much emphasis either . At price sells , I consider bargain.The ) You need pay attention installing removing - damage sound hole guitar 're ) No volume 're looking occasionally amplify acoustic guitar , great , cost-effective way go . I 've used variety 6 strings 12 strings really give good sound price . And 've got variety acoustics n't want get pickups installed ALL great solution . It tends work slightly better finger picking strumming occasionally hand hit chord coming 're must used preamp hopefully something ( likely tuner ) stomp on/off bypass turn easily . Easy use . No metallic hiss 'd normally expect . The real drawback lack presence comes bassier strings . It takes skill EQ things point . If 're uncomfortable dealing EQ , might best bet . Otherwise , wonderful product great price .

721	Have couple guitars bass hooked time . audio interface . No cable switching . Did n't need sophistication mixers costing 5x much . Fast convenient way switch guitars recording . 1 Digital , 1 Electronic guitar , 1 microphone ( non XLR ) , Keyboard . I got Musical . This mixer works great . No complaints , works ! All connections 1/4 '' mono . I bunch instruments ( synths , back recordings , ... ) plugged straight bass amp home recording/practice.. Having one helps reducing amount cabling hanging everywhere . It works fine . It lightweight feels sturdy.Only drawback : I tried getting straight active bass , preamps saturated low frequencies . Input kept within small range . 'm talking : cheap usual form behringer . handy . hope would run batteries next time . I put two pickups resonator guitar , magnetic transducer . This -- musical device -- solution using pickups without building little box two volume controls . I plug two cords mixer , one pickup , blend balance two pickups . It works . It cost little buying parts build something like electric guitar wiring setup works box labor cost almost zero . , 's active device boost signal . Only con runs 12 V n't battery option . I live . I pretty weird pedalboard set-up involving EHX digital Memory Man looped back another split earlier pedal chain . This great job summing three outputs back one signal I go reverb pedal amp . Takes little dial exactly knobs , get loud top end , I noticed issues sound knob around . I tested see I could tell difference noise due pedal found none . I use small mobile DJ setup mostly microphone inputs using small mixer . Simple use , works great , hum buzz . These amazing little inexpensive mixers . If need sum together signals get job two vocal effects rack summing effects six feeds ( three per mixer ) two outputs ( one per mixer ) , mixers feed direct boxes go back front house console , lets us effects stage performers control send signal back console adding main mix . We noise problems mixers really solved problem , I needed tiny flexible mixers I could preset fit inside rack way , extremely inexpensive work luck good music This box works great needs . I using three guitars stage ( When possible/room permitting . ) use mixer combine three one output amp . This way I leave three guitars plugged take time songs changing cords . It also solves second problem : since pick ups guitar different outputs ( Fender single coils , Ibanez acoustic Fishman piezo Les Paul Gibson Humbuckers ) , I volume controls make overall volumes match . This perfect . Inexpensive unit made brushed aluminum quiet adds little boost signal I velcro small pedal 'm glad someone else mentioned A/C plug standard 110 volt US standard . Do n't surprised happens . I bought one experience . I got mine Musicians Friend . They offered return I chose keep since I 12 volt power supply available older unit I long since stopped using . No stars deducted since manufacturers fault supplier n't check make sure US standard . I needed way boost input wired lapel microphone coming preacher directly powered speakers . Works great ! 
722	The best buy bass drum These patches greatly extend life bass drum heads . Even use felt beaters kick pedal pads greatly increase strength toughness bass drum head exact place needed . As far I tel change sound head much . They stay exactly put sure get right first time.If double bass kick pedal I highly recommend either patch one another name brand company . These impact pads came fast job although one pad I received ive already warn less 3 weeks This saved bass drum head many holes . Also affect sound bass recommend . This works , I really like Evans . But I got 2 looked different looked cheap . Although I using awhile hard use holding great saving kick drum head abuse . The Evans Pedal Patch work It keep mass drum head I cheap buy works excellent.. In writing simple review simple product 's concerns . 1 . Would adhesive dry 2. wear time ? The answer gets 4 stars . It n't dry I replace mine 5 years eventually wore . That 's pretty good ! Not perfect pretty god ! They add depth bass drum muffling overtones bit , pads wear rather bass drum head actually save money sound better . I 've used couple different brands , pretty much similar . look slick work really good , would recommend anyone needs bass drum patch patch goes spot beater beats bass drum , guess provides useful purpose like kicking thru bass drum skin , came nice , price right , ... go ! ! ! I think patch looks cool bass . I n't really hear difference sound , But give drum head better life span 
723	I bought amp 7 year old son . It great , really serious practice : dirty phone : Speaker low quality sounds rough distorted : $ 30- $ 40 get better setupGood alternatives : Fender Mustang , Peavey , Line6 Spider IV , Vox , Marshall . I ca n't say anything bad I n't know much fact works I 'm beginner enough . 'm committed learning , 'll get better one later ! Small size , easy transport , enough power annoy small venue lousy ( improving ) guitar playing : amp small size full sound . size little bottom end still cranks ! ! responsive , clean sounding . amp well worth price . I spent lot time Amazon reading reviews - comparing prices . I wanted amp would overdrive I also wanted power . There many choices small portable units ( I afraid would sound like toys ) big units ( They would sound great I could n't afford ) . I thrilled Starcaster . This amp delivers huge sound overdrive sounds great grunge metal also play crisp clear rock country . If want small amp take anywhere able show rock star image - one . I got This amp 9 year old son along Squire mini strat . good combination . My son loves . I bought used friend I got first Electric . It 's great little practice amp plenty loud enough small room . The works well enough . Bass treble adjustable seem fine . Input jack held real well far ( amp 4 years old ) speaker pretty clean . My problem volume go low enough . I ca n't practice everyone else room watching tv . I suppose set headphones would solve problem- something else I got ta plug worry . I find I like sound overdrive better ( especially thru Epi LP ) ca n't play low enough . I end turn overdrive , turning amp loud turning guitar real low . If issues volume control make sure get set headphones- else could suffer dirty looks , I suffered . All real nice practice amp good price point .

725	Never used seller site purpose . Sat went everything chose strap locks . They fit perfectly I used Strat , , Ibenez . Easy , time delivery , hassle either quality service . This seller worth supporting . Thanks ! ! A terribly easy install good quality straplock . I pleased match Telecaster . Straplocks must electric guitar exceed need . Nice straplock system ! Very easy install compared systems . The system secure locking system . This favorite locking system I arsenal . Love things.I feel little guilty I put pair Epiphone Les Paul plus top . I also Fender Marauder I easily swap straps guitars I 'm secure knowledge 's going land could put one plastic Dunlop pick looking things regular strap keep place look feel much cooler . They use quick connect kind found natural gas , compressed air connectors . locking ring , slide release . I using strap locks types years . This new Fender Straplocks make installing strap easy . I 'm impressed . You . I bought new Strat . They look great , 're easy install , work well.I like release , 's performed squeezing thumb `` F '' finger metal ring inside guitar strap . Hard explain , I prefer pull-style strap locks I 've seen side n't easy install uninstall strap locks attach nut . Make sure strap set correct length ( vintage-style leather straps ) install locks avoid rework later . My revised review ( year use ) : The one thing I hated screw suppose hold two pieces guitar strap together slowly backs way , 're careful , guitar fall . It habit mine tighten two parts guitar strap , every original review : Very easy install ; n't require drilling . I installed stratocaster minutes . Although looks little bit big clunky , 's small price pay stability . I probably get another set , may get black ones instead silver I think black color may hide `` '' little better . Overall , good product . One ball bearings designed catch lock side mounted strap dislodged , expensive Fender Custom Shop Telecaster fell flat ground . The best look performance Fender guitar . I 've used Schaller & Fender pinch top found best performing , easiest use , best looking . It larger profile , I find flattering fender guitar form . Easy install never failed . I like three pins ensure proper grip rather one pin holding channel like Schaller & clones . Outside security ( I find greater 3 pins ) boils personal preference comes strap locks . These Fender knobs came looked Good I n't Problems , They installed Fine . I put pick one Screw holes tighten . everything fender fender parts - hold good dunlops easier get sweaty fingers . give comfort locked solid requires push pull come . I get furious guitar comes strap stopped kept fender mojo going . I gave strap lock 4 star large interchangeable Schaller locks . It great lock works fine , . 
726	I bought replace actual PA VERY pleasantly surprised.Pros : GREAT price , VERY loud ( well clear ) . Also compact : Line : As monitor look . I use PA practicing God-send . Buy ! I looking small , high quality monitor use Praise Band church . I needed run Boss GT-100 vocals stage . This little speaker loud enough good size stage reasonable stage volume . It built extremely well/very solid sounds incredible . The volume sound quality coming simply amazing . I still someone asks turn guitar I sound comes little speaker sitting floor . There threaded mic stand socket bottom , I place floor angle back putting DI box underneath . Between GT-100 I ultimate direct guitar system , inputs still available monitor feed main board . Simply fantastic piece equipment . One sufficient small venues main keyboard amp channels mic backing track . A pair connected via stereo link jacks handle larger venues including outside gigs . They configured set-up single link cable ( 1/4 inch speaker cable ) , two cables two fully functioning amps handle ten inputs , assuming five inputs per CM-30 . In reality single cable configuration sufficient.The low , mid high range frequencies perfect either piano organ . I run aRoland RD-300NX Digital V-Combo . The grand piano setting RD-300NX sounds like real thing amp , emulation direct comparison Compact Active PA sound beat hand 's . Bear mind designed keyboards sound optimized instruments frequency range.Vocals channel XLR adequate , particularly spectacular . Also , phantom power ground lift features , able use studio condenser mics correct electrical . That leads conclude best live use mine powered main , designed function monitor main controls front box . That somewhat inconvenient using main controls facing away . However , levels set sound check control levels via instrument 's volume EQ things note regarding mounting mic stand . First , manual recommends total height top CM-30 floor exceed 43 inches . I agree . This may relatively small , 's heavy twelve pounds center gravity limited recommended height fairly high . It 's easy tip , especially using tripod style mic stand legs fully extended . I play guitar sing relatively small places , . I previously used Fender Acoustasonic Jr I got tired lugging ( 50 lbs ) gig equipment around . With CM-30 I get ( 12 lbs ) , mic stands , music stand , mic , various cables etc medium sized rolling duffel . That means I haul I need one trip . A big plus.I like sound quality I get . My guitar acoustic onboard preamp mic Shure SM-57 . The Roland n't huge amount volume , 're looking something sounds natural easy transport , set take , good choice . ( If I used passive guitar pick-up , I 'd want external preamp . ) Think sound booster playing bigger space living room.I 'm also thinking I use larger rooms personal monitor Acoustasonic looks really rugged , I 'm looking forward years happy use . I 'm frankly sick tired showing gig keyboard run P.A. , thereby essence causing control instrument bandleader ( board ) . Still , I 've concede amps I 've using -- Roland KC150 , -- plenty power pop sonic would recommend Bose P.A . set-up band uses . Then , I needed small amp XLR connection use emergency P.A. , I picked relatively new item Roland , prominently describes `` monitor '' amp ( i.e . meant performer 's ears ) I surprised I got thing home put rounds Kurzweil . It 's little compact brick , appears power KC150 , importantly , terms `` '' sounds like several heavens apart KC 150 350 ( Roland KC amps make piano , including , sound uninspiring boring course gig ) . This latest contender covers entire piano range , effortlessly , smoothly , providing rich yet responsive bass needed brilliant strident highs . Perhaps would judge sound trifle `` colored . '' If , I 'll take coloration day untempered sounds I 've getting electric keyboards . The mid-range tight controlled , upper register `` growing '' gradually unmistakably . By contrast , upper register heavy-duty KC amps strikes like serpent , leaping mix like white lightning hitting palate 's gotten accustomed vintage even compared little thing previous standard -- Roland Cube 60 preceded KC150 ( around long ) . This new one smoother , bending bass notes like willow springing top ones like fresh spring . In words , even Roland Cube sounded uneven rough compared latest , handled tones scale like single portamento , revealing holes registers.Playing instrument amplifier job lead judgment radically different one made home . If instruments ( I 'm usually playing 2-3 ) mixed P.A. , fine . I wo n't listen . They 'll processed monitor , facing playing kicks stuff bandleader worthy public 's ears . I use two channels , Fishman center channel . I use Rode stereo mic , run everything Mackie mixer , adding reverb delay ( delay little left , send right channel , vice versa ) , sounds fantastic ( way better Fishman alone ) . Another tip : Get copy Yamaha 's Sound Handbook ... comes audio , many aspects effect , really need good technical understanding , otherwise could randomly mess around everything forever get `` ok '' sound . 
727	This recommended top engineer bass amplification company . Andy said product far superior . He right . Fixed scratchy potentiometer amp . Also fixed effects loop jacks , become oxidized causing amp intermittently lose 90 % power gigs . Not good ! After several gigs worth testing , problems resolved ! Andy said product actually works better time applied since lubricating , cleaning coating effect components . Wow ! And , Andy stock , affiliation , represent way manufacturers . Nor I . This thing like magic Spray ! ! Seriously ... I used noisy hinges , car doors , etc.I really bought clean ( volume controls knobs ) Guitars , pedals equipment . It really work gets rid static noise get turn volume control radio guitar example . I bought product use amp pots . It restored sound , power n't evaporate right away , couple minutes good go ! Back 1980 's I bought ( right name ca n't remember ) worked much better cost much less . It made military . The spray 3 levels low still way high . It work stuff I used much better . I n't see much else I may stick it.It wasteful cost . I good luck wd40 , flammable . I would call average . Before pay tech fix knobs switches guitar , stomp box amp , try . 95 % time , take care problem . If amp cuts , also try spraying effects loop pushing 1/4 & # 34 ; jack socket dozen times . The first I bought probably paid hundred times . Good stuff ! I deal quite bit electronic musical instrument gear guitars , basses , amps , FX , MIDI gear , etc . Over time starts suffering scratchy / noisy pots ( knobs ) , input output jacks crackly , past I 've tried Locktite electronics cleaner , provided similar . It would rarely work.In contrast cleaned every piece gear I 've used saving physically replace pots jacks . It 's really like magic . I getting errors printer cartridge n't recognized I sprayed contacts wiped excess paper towel . Now 's working ! This stuff works great well worth price , I used clean pots several guitars bass amp along various effect pedals , scratchiness , jarring volume spikes , knobs glide better day new , I 'll always keep around , nothing say , great stuff . Fantastic stuff ... .I sprayed bass guitar 's pot like new . Wish I found stuff sooner . What , ? dab ya ? Something like -This need contact cleaning . Worth coin . I 've got old mesa boogie developed scratchy controls years.This stuff cleaned pretty well midrange pot starting crackle again.I hate tear chassis 'd got ta happen I used guitar Tone Volume pots clears little oily , gets job done n't replacethe potentiometers . Use alot kinds electronics . It gets crackling knobs going . I 've use years . recommend The pots bass become & # 34 ; scratchy & # 34 ; I sprayed bit , turn pots back forth times noise . Great I needed . 
728	GREAT WORK MAT FOR ELECTRIC AND ACOUSTIC AS WELL AS BASS AND AT MY . HOWEVER , I NEVER IT OUT WORKING ON A GUITAR , TO MANY OTHER OF WHO WHAT AROUND IN MY AND I DO N'T WANT ANYTHING ON MAT THAT COULD SCRATCH ONE OF MY ! I used whenever I changing guitar strings whenever I tuning intonating Fender Strat . The surface perfect ( rolling away screws , scratching guitar shiny finish , perfect ) I n't sure expect , foam rubber bit let , especially I took plastic . Very strong fumes , pleasant , basement fumes I little concerned material might wood finish . I happy see apparent smudging marking two hours . I would n't leave anything `` finished '' longer type foam n't last forever breaks residue hard remove . For , 's great.It comes black nylon , sort mesh tube shaped bag , good putting away traveling . For I leave flat possible n't curl much . For size utility , price ( goes ) seems reasonable . I thought would protect desk pad almost like rubber put rugs wo n't slip around . maybe get cheaper.I accidently bought LARGE , boy ; like , windshield sun reflector size . personal opinion review suppose . The mat right size guitar performing maintenance . It firm soft enough protect finish guitar . easily wiped leave stain mat . I use working guitars mainly . It job well pretty large . It 's soft padded well anti static . A nice work mat adequate size provides nice covering bench . Grey color makes easy easy see small parts , etc , opposed black black objects hard differentiate .

731	I played Wedding March son 's outdoor wedding back April I needed amp folks would able hear . I plugged Martin HD-28 went well . The Martin Fishman Pickup ( narrow style ) together pickup , amp put real sweet sound . As I said , wedding outdoors everyone Wedding March , I know heard - I n't even crank volume.In den , I practiced , I barely raised volume , else would WAY loud . So , short , I 'd buy . Do let size little amp fool . I used Roland Fender amps PA 's . I heard buddy preforming drummer bass went bought next day . I use small solo gigs . But cover good size room also . Great vocal guitar sounds . I ca n't believe come six half inch speaker days . JUST AMAZING . I cut amount equipment considerably I need gig anymore . It wont break bank wont break back . I mostly happy amp , sounds great acoustic amplification needs . With said , I shopping around amp , online person , ALL amps I tried read ( expensive cheap amps ) one characteristic common , missing one , I thought universal : n't allow connect headphone private practicing , I purchase headphone amp separately , n't expecting that.This may seem nit pick , considering universality feature , best advised know present amp . Other , great amp . I could see making recording small medium venue . Nice little acoustic amplifier gets job done high fidelity sufficient volume . reviews posted Amazon , Sweetwater Sound , Musician 's Friend pages positive ones pretty much hit mark . This 60W amplifies guitar nicely reproduces vocals quality mic . There ' sets amp sellers Amazon bundle cables mics , et ... recommend steering away buying amp Amazon getting Shure SM58 ( quality mic ) seperately.Many reviews talk durability easy amp ding scratch . I see potential , too- thus need carry bag mentioned . But I n't see big downer I personally n't mind takes road worn bumping times . If appearance thing , shell extra $ 200 buy Roland Fender ... Shop around ... click around ... buy & # 34 ; items sold Amazon & # 34 ; depend Free Shipping . If buy sellers THROUGH Amazon usually pay shipping overall pricetag bigger . And I 've stated reviews , sellers sell Amazon sometimes ship slower make mistakes shipping ... know going . On major music retailers ' sites baby going $ 360 $ . Got door $ . I really ca n't say enough ease shopping , trustworthiness , quick delivery items sold Amazon . 5 stars service ... fact Amp awesome makes much better.You probably wo n't able find carry case fits amp , I bought Black universal Machine ' $ 20 's perfect . It fits mini snugly , room odds ends like cables mics maybe small pedals . With current setup I walk room carrying whole shebang two hands , 's really neat . The closest case ' would $ 100 1x12 combo case wo n't fit right would take away whole portability thing.You 're going find 20 lbs $ 300 worth quality amp anywhere else . When compared makers ( ) nothing gets consistently good reviews little guy gets , I understand . Recommend without hesitation ! And reviews something goes wrong road I 'll edit review share . But I expect amp meet needs long time come ... Now , one GREAT piece kit . Two , 60 watts ( real power ) , super control sound channel . Only complaint ? IT 'S ! brown ... cheesy looking . If prom date , I 'd put sack head ( yeah , well , I 'm another George anything ) . Acoustic guitar amps common stereo systems traditional electric guitar amps : neutral full-range sound ( rather crunch & distortion ) , high power ratings clean tone , full range speaker system woofer tweeter sensitive preamp inputs optimized low output piezo pickups . Unfortunately , acoustic amps tend optimized steel-strings rarely get classical guitar tone right , even dial . As dedicated nylon-string player , I 'm always looking holy grail amps . Is Mini sent heaven ? TONE : I jacked Takamine Classical ( classicals Cool Tubes preamps ) tone controls set flat ears pinned back shockingly powerful output . The master volume barely cracked little guy loud . Unfortunately , big sound n't natural sounded closer electric guitar classical : big bass , bright lower trebles , weak mids , quacky tone compressed . Obviously , under-saddle piezo pickups studio mic sound better . So I controls improved bit I could n't dial pleasing tone . The best timbre , treble-9:00 ( clock face orientation ) acoustic guitar amps allow tweeter disabled I suspect Mini 's overly bright tone would benefit cutting little guy circuit . As point comparison , Cool Tube piezo pickup tone 21 year old Trace Elliot TA50R much natural , complex sustained . Cool Tube piezo tone gorgeous . Perhaps amps additional processing tone ? They cost Mini got ta earn keep somehow.I plugged Trace Acoustic preamp Mini able dial better tone , albeit still good ancient TA50R . I also tested Fishman Aura Spectrum D.I . rendered natural classical tone . So get decent classical guitar tone 're willing carry another box : The single program digital reverb makes amp timbre brighter harsher sounding , even mixed sparingly . Wish amp effects loop budget half rack unit sound TONE : I n't normally use mic casual gigs feature handy need mic friend blend small internal mic extra ambience . The Mini lacks phantom power I installed battery Shure condenser mic , set tone controls flat surprisingly natural mic tone . I also tried ancient Shure SM57 dynamic mic similar good results , albeit mic needed little treble cut . As point comparison , Mini whips TA50R good terms mic output tone.APPEARANCE & : The Loudbox looks attractive pictures . And much lighter slightly smaller TA50R . If drag gigs 'll find exterior delicate : vinyl material underlying wood easily damaged gentle pressure straps . It 's delicate amp I 've BLURB : My feelings amp mixed . For value use wee PA 's 5 star deal . For saddle pickup classical guitar amplification works far natural : compressed dynamics , bright lower highs ( even full treble cut ) dreaded piezo quack . So 2 stars classical guitar reproduction . The Fishman Aura Spectrum D.I . similar acoustic guitar processor significantly improve tone , 's another 2 3 bills . Unfortunately , straight cardboard , Loudbox ready primetime nylon string reproduction .

Now I finally one , I 'm throwing pieces junk buying Hercules stands.It hold acoustic electric guitars well . With extendable neck , also handle bass guitar .

I use music stand acoustic bass electric bass instruments quite large secures well easily accessed . I also use acoustic tenor guitar end scale size works beautifully , reasonable size transport . My complaint n't fold smaller , otherwise excellent stand . I concede I 'm bit spoiled super light weight much compact folded dimensions & M Memphis Pro Guitar Stand . However light weight comes cost slightly fragile build . The extra heft Hercules advantage slightly better stability remove instrument stand ( K & M ; tends want bounce backward weight removed used padded carpeted floor ) . Despite folding quite small , Hercules simpler unfold adjust ( one action legs , one action height , whereas K & M ; three separate legs two vertical sections / clamps ) . I realize I bought one without folding yoke considering aspect comparing K & M . ; Length folded would still quite bit larger K & M ; ( large enough I wo n't try carrying gig bag pocket I K & M ; ) .I 'm also convinced Hercules ' trade mark pivoting finger yoke necessary type stand . The back angle fact good portion instrument rests padded legs means would take much force knock instrument 's knock whole stand . No big deal , parts ( weight ) . I think I prefer K & M ; 's yoke , automatically adjusts width neck weight applied . The Hercules fixed width yoke pivoting `` gates '' . Both work perfectly well Fender similar bass head stocks.I 've two K & M ; 's second bit disaster . It defective two areas . happen , one highlighted weakness concerns bit , lead try Hercules ( I wo n't go , see review product ) . Aside potential weak spot yoke , Hercules prove far durable tolerant occasional clumsiness . I 'm glad I purchased one I think I 'll get plenty use . But I mention , allow better understand appreciate strengths K & M ; , mainly awesome portability ( despite slightly fragile nature ) .In interest comparison , I 've got GS100 Support 100 Guitar order , review K & M ; well . I opted without automatic closing mechanism one reasons I stated I n't believe strictly necessary . The reviews GS100 also favorable , GS100 cheaper ( suits . I 've playing guitar since 1960 's , I 've gone plenty guitar stands . Always found safest & secure . For long time I using chrome hanging stand . When I first saw used guitar players church I ( Church , St Charles , ) , I decided give look . The build quality good sections come contact guitar ( Electric Acoustic ) padded foam material prevent scratching/ denting . It offers solid support I feel safe putting guitar . This type stand I prefer use . I wish n't made China , much money goes country ( opinion ) . The bottom line I happy stand would recommend guitar player wants sturdy , well built stand keeps guitar safe last ever . I heard alot stands finally decided buy one cheapo one fell bass still it.This nice looking , well designed stand feels like withstand rigors constant use . However , 5th time I took show , I expanded one screws nuts attaching back leg support bar fell I never fine missing screw ... wound wrapping electrical tape around support bass night . I ended buying screws fixing ( also pain nut needs inserted 6 inches pipe secured thread screw ... .not easy task . I really expected better quality $ light use ... love , 5 star level . I bought stand primarily hold Epiphone Les Paul . I owned cheaper stands built well Hercules . The stand holds guitar place neck bottom guitar rests padding stand legs . There room movement guitar like stands . I also move guitar stand room room without issues . I plan buying another one hold rather large acoustic guitar . I like stand completely adjustable locks place.I strongly suggest stand heavier guitars rather cheaper stands , extra cost well worth investment . I bought local guitar shop $ 40 looking , manager guitar shop recommended people I there.UPDATE A weeks ago , I bought second one seeing amazon price lower local retailers . I usually buy locally , deal great . The stand worth price . This hands best guitar stand market . It last lifetime never drop axe . I two plus wall mount hanger basses I love ! I leery leaving Fender 5 string Custom Jazz bass guitar stands I met Hercules . The stand `` built like tank '' sturdy legs strong upper support fits neck headstock bass perfectly . My bass weighs 9.5 pounds strap long neck , fits perfectly Hercules , body bass resting well-balanced padded design reclining angle stand makes extremely stable I experimented trying tip bass . It take `` accident '' tip bass stand . The self-closing mechanism works well requires effort lock unlock.The lock engaged simply placing bass locking mechanism . The lock releases lifting bass stand.My dislike bright yellow paint leg hinge mechanism . I would preferred stand conservative black .

734	To heavy music guitarist , I highly recommend one ! Try set feel like rock star ! I got pair strings early august , still , doubtful , bought extra pair seller ( shipped amazingly fast , got 3 days ! ) ways , strings stay bright long time , lost color yet/rusted ( little four months ) everything guitar player looks strings . lot string bends held . I B.C Rich SOB Avenge , ca n't tell like tremolo , like . I tried GHS , First act , Dunlop , D'addario 's ones last long showing signs significant wear . I love strings , never stop amazing ! ... wether use electric acoustic always work well , clean bright tones heavy riff giving , strings last work well.. I 've never tried another type strings I n't think I Great strings . They last longer others easy re-string brands seem stand Ernie Balls I almost always use Ernie Ball strings electric guitars . I 've using 30 years never let quality sound . At one point I strong hatred strings strat , I smartened , worked point I could probably play 's tuned E trouble , realized strings worked great strat , strong tone provide , ease bending upper frets . These strings also good Les Pauls , scale length shorter Fender guitars , making bending like velvet . For price awesome strings ... . I like sound ( I like little heavier sound ) , I 'm hoping high E hold little longer lower gauge & # 34 ; always first go & # 34 ; . You cant beat price amazon I paid music store I needed strings ASAP , I order back ups price . 
735	Well , I n't really know else say.. I ordered guitar , Though I wo n't using banjo . ( I prefer sound clawhammer banjo ) The thumb picks fit thumb perfectly , finger picks needed tiny squeeze stay put . They feel kind alien right , 's first time I 've ever wore finger picks , I 'll get used eventually : P . I started playing banjo want wrap tons money supplies . This perfect `` kit '' giving everything need start great price . The picks arrived quickly , within couple days order . They work well adjusting fit . The thumb picks work well us , big get fit way , small friend use . Ca n't get banjo sound right without great set finger thumb picks . using years . There doubt , National fingerpicks pretty much standard . The metal fingerpicks rock solid , sturdy-gauge steel . The plastic thumbpicks match tone well . And , note unlike may read another review , adjustable . You need heat hot water bend fit . On resonator , provide full , loud sound . The reasons n't rate 5 stars ( 1 ) F Tone fingerpicks I usually use provide much sense feel , ( 2 ) National fingerpicks tendency little noisier Pro-Picks guitar 's unwound strings . Even though I like National metal fingerpicks much better plastic fingerpicks I 've used , even though produce fullness Pro-Picks , sense feel I get design Pro-Picks trumps volume . This important keep mind players whose fingerpicking experience fingers alone . Players already used metal plastic fingerpicks give National picks strong consideration . They solid , sound great , packaging excellent ! By way , bonus pick cute ( go logo pick collection ) , 's thin gauge useful anything electric guitar . I started learning banjo picks worth . They really help cheap price . Just want reiterate however another review mentioned ... thumbpicks came medium , time I n't pay attention . However , 3 weeks using ( fingerpicks ) banjo , I came conclusion I needed large size thumb ( mediums sat little high thumbnail comfort ) . I suppose could put hot water `` stretch '' I read , regardless , quick-n-dirty set someone starting , ticket without buy bunch sets 12 figure comfortable . With price/assortment mind , I give 5 stars . This hand full picks saves fingernails , best , easy fit fingertips though thumb picks came size I used .

Will purchase extender use . I purchased On Stage brand microphone stand use theremin , although I may use point purpose designed . This substantial , stable , solidly built stand . The base heavy enough I ca n't image stand would fall normal use . Should need arise , also easy disassemble assemble . Highly recommended . This stand practically indestructible ideal gigging . If need boom , simply add anOn Stage MSA7040TB Adjustable Microphone Boom , Blackand 're good go.In addition indestructible , stand takes far less stage ( studio ) real estate tripod type stand like theOn Stage Stands MS7701 Tripod Boom Microphone Stand . And despite relatively small size base , far stable tripod stands . Admittedly , stand great deal heavier , weight issue may like type.Even boom fully extended I found stand stable . For outside use fair breezes stand remains upright , always case tripod types . Moreover , legs break ( I lost one tripod stand problem . ) If transport gear often , especially play outside ( inside cramped stages ) stand best choice opinion . Not much I say standard mic stand . Unless cheap piece crap . This one . Nice heavy base plate . Here complaint : I went remove UPC sticker shaft I mess . I 'll try WD-40 get annoying residue crying loud , ca n't anyone come sticker removable without headache ? And end user , UPC sticker serves nobody . Why even ?

739	I let know I 've using boom stands 35 years I write make informed decision . I 'm loyal audio community industry already put one kids see half stand fine boom good . I particularly n't think horizontal axis point good , I mean adjust angle boom . It 's cheap version simple design I suspect day come 're trying figure keep , problem surface area much smaller creating less friction tightening something 's got give . The tightening screws slide also seem pretty poor I 'd predict someday 'll going duct tape replacing . I base experience sound reinforcement , harder equipment recording I types . The boom general n't nice one always 32 inches n't telescoping uses pretend plastic counterweight , 're mainly purchasing stand . On Stage better line call vs series.9701B Pro Tripod Microphone Boom like ca n't compare price used compact car new full size pickup , one inexpensive ( inexpensive ? ) price comparisons n't 's important , looking Amazon today I 'd probably buy Microphone one , DR Pro Mic Stand maybe try Mic Stand n't tried stand since Hosa generally sells good inexpensive products I 'd inclined give try . I think 'll end spending money next stand might well instead twice . I 'd pay attention 2 3 star reviews 'll find experienced users helpful 5 star say long 've using love inexpensive . Ignore n't come mic clip usually n't , clips come microphones purchased separately . All best stands fall unbalanced , plan putting weight leg 're using heavy mic like condenser spending lot money . $ 100+ buy studio boom although counterweight , like 's used cymbal boom help boom stand could created little imagination .

Tubes tough sturdy Quite resistant reliableGreat quality I looking forward purchasing brand . Thank much This seems like good deal price . I concerns durability anyone frequently adjust boom , takes road , joint bit flimsy . I bought home studio use , I totally satisfied . This fine stand price , I honestly surprised light . I honestly think On Stage might making progressively lighter years offer heavier duty one higher price . I use stand , I wish I would sprung heavier duty version probably near future . It works fine , keep mind heavy duty metal construction stand past . This stands holds microphone stand study , easily adjustable , withstands rigours use . No description say mic clip NOT included . The place box AFTER received item . There 's instruction ( fine ) . But product description n't say must purchase mic clip separately ca n't use it.I bought shipped second day I need use I ca n't n't come Mic Clip I spend another 5-10 get plus shipping . The price stand reasonable included mic clip . But without , I felt . Solid , stays I put , great job holding heavy mic , mount pop filter . Ca n't really beat price . I totally satisfied stand . I misgivings reading negative reviews Amazon stand serves well . The misgivings I extra weight I intended place tablet stand equipment Samsung tablet . However , I happy report handles extra weight well topple even boom extended mic space needed tablet guitar playing . I easily reommend Item . I needed cheap mic stand n't break bank . This little guy fit bill . I n't know could stand next Hercules stands I used years terms long-term durability , simple , stand , perfect . It sturdy , knobs feel tight balanced . Great entry-level stand ! Light weight sturdy enough Title says . Good quality home studio use , sure would survive taken tour . Still price get nice adjustable stand manipulated get basically mic position 'd want , overhead drums fret level guitars , vocalists depending tone 're hunting , etc . Versatile great work . Its little unstable times , fasteners adjustment areas stand keep stand place good sound studio classroom setting , sure I would recommend professional use , 's spend better quality right ? really good fairly heavy microphone , adjustments stay place without constantly tightening , works exactly This tough deal beat boom stand . It well made , adjustable issues sitting standing , playing singing . Only thing , make sure read description well . It stand 5/8 '' threads . It come mic clip . When I ordered mic Behringer , clip 3/8 '' standard threads obviously would attach . I ordered univeral clip drove cost . Now manufacture would provide clip , would best stand deal going . Overall , I would buy ! This stand probably one popular among smaller bands , home studio owners I run across everywhere . And like everyone else I wound . Here I learned four years I owned used model : - For money bargain work extremely well home studios practice spaces ( assuming areas overly cramped . ) - They hold light gigging jamming , meaning transported two three days week.- Good stability inside , even heavier microphones like theBlue Microphones enCORE 100 Studio-Grade Dynamic Performance Microphone . Not good outside fair breeze.I lost one stepping inadvertently one feet , immediately broke , another started binding I try extend collapse center pole . Those problems necessarily quality issues since case broken tripod fault gear 's . As binding - I sure good amount grime found way tube four years use transporting stands . Had I taken better care problems may prevented.For inexpensive stands hard beat . However , I use theSeismic Audio - Tripod Microphone Mic Boom Stand - use , I consider superior stand small increase price . Also , outside use stage real estate issue I found old school styleOn Stage Round Base Microphone Stand , Blackto far better solution . This could used lightweight microphones n't bother wasting money 're using studio microphone . The base small circumference , ca n't stick boom far , almost useless . There better deals slightly money . Or really want near studio quality , try Samson studio boom mic stands . I use home recording studio . This stand versatile enough used almost angle . From playing singing piano , recording guitar vocals , various positions . Sometimes hard keep mic firmly place may function shock highly recommended . I like stand . It makes recording convenient . It well built . The adjustable parts easy use . stand good wish bit heavier helping stable using heavy mic . Got stand mount Studio Projects C1 condenser mic . The stand stable works well . It reasonably priced well . It 's well built enough stand regular use . I use mine recording performance . It ' works great . Currently using Blue Yeti microphone Blue Radius Shock Mount . When fully extended , arm ca n't hold entire weight shockmount+Yeti microphone . I rigged behind monitor wall mount frame ( n't want mount walls ) works fancy retractable arm , trick fine . All adjustments keep position well . About sturdy tripod . Exactly advertised , complaints user . When extend way , sometimes topples due little weight bottom , , stand perfect . Good stand , solid components , easily adjustable boom good length . I gave drummer uses regularly without complaint I actually use stand holding use video photo purposes : Holding light reflectors , , speedlights , etc.It 's heavier looks cheaper stands specifically marketed photo . This mic stand everything says , adjustable every way . In fact , boom really nice adjusting lever , making easy loosen tighten . The drawback I found tripod configuration feet , making easy forget parked big feet live performances ; especially 're invested crowd urging . I would much prefer round base . Other , makes great mic stand band kickin ' . 'Nuff said . Provides everything I need mic stand . Everything locks nice stand remains firm . small . I knocked one star look carefully stand , leans ever slightly . It cheap Chinese stand . This stand ( arrived mail ) durable years come music I tell . Awesome stand I would recommend anyone ! Not best quality world , price tag n't half bad ! If 're something professional may wear overtime , 's personal use , fine product ! I cant play real guitars ... ... . buy Rock Band .

Well one actually better ones wifes band . Oh almost impossible knock , believe cats tried .

744	I 'm beginner ukulele player , I bought one cheap ukulele 's Amazon . It n't sound good , I n't know instrument strings . It strings , I 'm glad I replaced strings . They make ukulele sound like , holds tuning pretty well . I 'm happy purchase . Do n't panic , strings marked # CAN used fine tuning ... They n't seem quite nice comparable Aquilas , 're half price ... They $ 20 uke ... ( And yeah , new $ 4 strings improve sound $ 20 uke ! ) . Addario strings ok.. Although like beauty eyes ... Aquila seems popular . I used I satisfied ... I play soprano , concert , tenor , baritone . Each one different right ... Also play concert scale Only playing uke 5 years banjo 10 IMHO . Be aware though 10 years experience mean 1 year experience 10 times : ) ) ) ) These great strings `` rare '' instrument . Not many people play baritone yuke - unique quality , sort like miniature classical guitar . These strings sound full warm instrument . I wanted black ukulele string replace stock strings yellow dolphin . These work soprano . The J53 good investment 6 bucks . They provide enough string change ukulele twice feels nice play . projection tone stock strings . Not best , worse strings , improvement . Bought strings replacement ones came ukulele ( originals lasted week ) . These D'Addario 's worn quite well still sound excellent . Great strings ! First , I 'm NO ukulele expert . That said : I replaced original strings newMahalo U-35PK Sparkling Soprano Ukulele Outfit . I know stated Concert , however , reading , still used soprano standard uke . I noticed difference sound strings . Like another reviewer said , 's going perform miracles cheap uke , sure helped lot . The sound quite bit louder much brighter well . I 'm loving sound . Also , I really like way look pink uke ; 's nice touch . I would definitely recommend . learning read things better , , I picked , I need read better I 4 Ukuleles , . different size right tenor wound string third string , I careful buying strings , wound bad , I suck playing , concert favorite discovered fits case I bought soprano I take travel.. So I got soprano ukulele ... fit fine . Not much say really good strings work . The annoying thing modern ideas Ukulele strings , indeed Guitar strings , wind aluminum wire - making least black aluminum hands , worst , damage skin contact . These rather inexpensive strings aluminum wound , silver plate wound - health problems possible strings makes best . 
745	This interesting , limited effect pedal . I bought mainly use ( ) steel guitar . On pedal steel bend notes pedals levers , steel players use volume pedal swells . However , I play standing volume pedal difficult control balancing one foot sensitivity pedals.This pedal gives simulation volume swells give steel guitar distinctive sound . It 's sort like automatic wah way works . Since steel always played picking individual strings ( chording ) , pedal works along technique . I combine sustainer make swells extend little , gives fair using volume pedal swell tried regular guitar , 's . For chords , add effect , 's distinctive , single notes , would depend song . I n't really found many instances 's useful either , I normally n't want volume swells solos guitar , steel guitar , works well . thiiiis whaaaaaat thooooought . Wow almost like opposite like violin sound reverse single delay sound . Got ta love slow It 's cool pedal , especially considering 's price , n't fooled . All pedal perform volume swells . Any sound able create pedal , would n't JUST using pedal . Think supplumentary effect . If want really get cool sounds pedal , need use combination effects ; delay , wah , distortion , etc.It 's convenient , playing want use volume swells , also want use effects like wah , whammy , something else requires attention feet . If get settings right click effect take care swells . I would say thats probably best part pedal biggest reason get . Pure 's quirks though , If set sensitivity way minimum drastically cuts sustain . To point non-existent . But purpose dial set like play loud fast still effect behave properly . If sensitivity increased say halfway try play loud fast , volume effect occur first note struck ... rest play effect , built well , doesnt add hiss . noticeable signal loss , sensitivity min . The battery compartment pain get thats sure . power adapters 's cheap , convenient . But would n't recommend someone metal fast loud styles play pretty much renders pedal useless ... especially since style usually results moments want hit sustain note middle playing hard fast ... type thing make pedal useless plastic circuitry . Oh reminds , casing plastic ... : -/ I bought effect I saw YouTube demos made look pretty good . I always wanted attack delay effect Behringer Slow Motion priced well competitors . When arrived , I tested thoroughly found tricky learn limited scope . It works well circumstances : All notes must played slowly , individually deliberately order attack delay effect kick . You ca n't play quick series notes expect effect work properly . Having said , I found effect nice , mastered technique . I tried use conjunction overdrive sustain pedals work well . Other reviewers suggested using digital analog delay pedal , I tried . I considered returning unit Amazon refund , I n't think would fair DOES work extent n't cost lot money first place . However , I think I would recommend friend . It Not I wanted . When A low We Not afford We Not use . I looking Is called Shimmer Reverbs Not Shimmer RV600 Because Digitech called Shimmer , String Swell Volume Swell Is linked Violin Sound It cost Me 30.00 Its called Slow Motion reason It played slow hear effect way hear It Is Over Drive played high Strings . It might good playing Bow , I No Idea I Not afford Bow .

I Taylor 910ce , two guitars I use - simple works great ! I longer use humidifying . There 's much go wrong humidifying solid wood acoustic guitar . Woods swell shrink based moisture vapor also affect tone quality.The beauty gel packs maintain consistent humidity make changes gradually . I four - continue use product . You 'll purchase system first , need get replacement packs . For Taylor Baby , string spacing little small , problem inserting pack three guitars . Very easy use . As recommendation keeping guitar good condition , I would also buy humidity meter keep tabs room store instruments . I several Taylor acoustics , kinds guitars . I bought original pack suggestion friend acoustics damaged humidity ( dry ) . These easy use , & # 34 ; recharged & # 34 ; feel like $ 3 much every couple months . I 've successfully recharged using distilled water 3 times , work great new . These also come resealable package , recharge store need replace set guitar tell 've dried fact get crunchy feeling . It means need replaced.To recharge , I take large ziplock plastic container lid ( big enough hold 1 quart ) , pour cups distilled water bottom . Next , I take smaller empty ziplock container ( bottom one big enough hold sandwich ) , water larger container . Then place 3 packs floating container ( stacked one another sides ) seal top larger container lid . It traps humidity container , membrane packs two-way , absorb reach capacity . I live dry climate , I add distilled water humidifiers almost daily . Since I ca n't afford add special room humidify instruments , planet waves humidipak next best thing . I get anywhere 4 6 weeks pack . The time effort pack saves keep humidifiers repleted water well worth price . On refillable humidifiers , really ca n't forget day two replenish water . With , lot security . Going trip ? You wo n't worry string instruments case . This thing awesome ! I hate refilling humidifiers , thing leave forget it.It pack hangs strings soundhole guitar , one restsin case 've playing 15 years , always used humidifier . This works good anything case nice % would recommend nice keep case . Just make sure proper humidity lazy guy I , I never changed packs end winter getting little I noticed past couple weeks absorbing water ! These really humidity system , rather humidifier ! They almost completely back normal state , , I convinced work . I bought Taylor . It seems keep things humidified well . I like idea takes moisture puts moisture needed.I replaced packs twice . I problems packages leaking creating problems guitars . These work great keep guitar case around 43 degrees seem last long past . They easy use ... . I continue buy I live dry region country . You take packs put sleeves . There double sleeve single sleeve . I double behind neck guitar guitar case single behind body . It worked far . It I live I want fret board happy . This wonderfual addition help maintain humidity guitar , product recommended Taylor guitars . They say 2-4 months , I 've never come close even month . Usually 3 weeks toast guitar case opened twice 3 weeks . If sounds good true , usually . I n't recommend . I bought new 12 string Guild acoustic . I use Oasis humidifier acoustics satisfied . The reason I tried one 's necessary spread strings quite bit get tube . And 12 strings , really put lot tension . Another difference nothing Planet Waves . You slip included packs ( 2 ) saddlebag type pouch slide strings . They last 3-4 months & n't anything else . Also comes 3rd one headstock . With others add water remeber check n't dry . I also used Dampit hangs cord , sometimes gets caught wiring acoustic-electric ! I may eventually replace Oasis humidifiers also . Standard great quality Planet certainly change price frequently throughout year . I think almost doubled price week I ordered ... sure . Let start saying I several types humidifiers worked well . The major upside humidifier worry guitar ! maintain constant relative humidity couldnt easier use.One star short 5 star review . Why ? The price replacement , wonderful system ! Unlike complained dry fast , I always gotten much longer life product promises . What I ca n't tell well actually meet humidity I 've never monitored humidity case see par manufacturer says . I taken pretty much faith deliver say read people like Bob Taylor Taylor guitars work . Bob good name incentive I know endorsing product might work , , I take Taylor lab people check thoroughly sure Humidipaks effectiveness Mr. Taylor would give endorsement . That good enough sell . But I n't buy Bob Taylor says work -- occupy cool niche I someone would fill . Planet Waves Humidipaks person willing spend little extra keep fiddling around water , sponges , gauges Oasis water bag something replace every often . That 's I want . Sure , water free . But fast 's job keep take care . So , worth buy disposable thing like n't mess ? Or want save $ 15 work wetting sponges whatnot weekly ? I 'll gladly pay extra bucks worry hydrating guitars cases 6 guitars shown signs humidity issues I lived New York City Beach years since I 've using Planet Waves Humidipaks . One I give Planet Waves recall product years back promised replacements new model resolved potential problem released . That re-release seemed drag I contacted Planet Waves gripe , sent check `` list '' price units I returned . Well list price three times retail price time bit minor windfall time impressed heck I used money buy humidity products humidify guitars . But Humidipaks available sent replacements . That really treated well Planet Waves I never used anything else Humidipaks since . Humidipaks give peace mind guitars humidified I 'm satisfied long last . 
747	So far cable worked well . It issues . For money even make . Cables good , complaint connectors . The 1/4 & # 34 ; bad , XLR end looks feels cheap . I guess 's cheap . Very good price good performance . No wierd signal buzz like cables category . Overall , 4 stars ! It 's nice Audio Technica one job I 'm happy . A little flimsier AT price 's good . Great price fragile . I 'm 30 year radio pro always careful cables . The end separated cable - good quality , would buy brand . In experience cables great . The connectors rattle , made cheap materials cable subsequently ton line noise . I ca n't expect miracles price-point I certainly expected better . I avoid brand cables . 
748	sleek design great product hinder hands fingers fretting chord . holds exceptionally well release effortless . really like padded material forgiving holds strings without fret buzz never damages guitars . also great & # 34 ; hang & # 34 ; headstock went use . Most time I able use G7 capo one hand moving , adjusting , clamping place . However , sometimes I use hands squeeze place strings n't buzz . That may seem like big deal , I prefer easier one work . I small hands , old carpal injury , I prefer little strain possible place capo . This one better kinds ( , etc ) respect . After couple playing sessions , I figured best use capo one hand time . Now I 've learned best use , I 'll keep . When I first got I upset I use 2 hands squeezing put place , I 've learned work better I one hand without much strain.A capo : easy remove put , stay tune , hurt hands ( 2 handed squeezing ) , interfere playing inserted , n't break soon ( least several months year breaking ) .On plus side , unit seems pretty well made , last long time . I think meets criteria except squeeze tight 've tried many capos , ones I liked Planet Waves screw tops , easy use , easy move fret fret , light hands , stay tune way , break damp California weather ( I 've 4 break , within couple months . They snap go , dangerous ) . Next I 'll try Dunlop Victor capos , screw tops similar style Planet Waves ( Dunlop also makes Planet Waves capos ) , made durable bronze , last longer , I hope best . I also ordered aluminum version Planet Waves hopes wo n't break like thermoplastic ones small hands like , n't want strain hands playing , like , rules Kysers squeezing type capos . The fall hassle around take adjust , springtop ones suspect well . That 's I like screwtops n't get way easy adjust . Ok , I hope Dunlop Victor job , I 'll try next . I owned G7th Capo year & far I 'm concerned beats others I 've owned past hands ! ! So easy use & clamp right guitar nut ease moving needed . I use Takamine Tele . It easy use , applies right amount tension looks cool . You leave clipped headstock using . Cheaper ones work , I wanted try . I like I bought capo thinking would look slicker without clamp handles sticking I found although looks cool , 's complicated ( capo saying something ) . The release lever makes difficult get good amount pressure strings nearly impossible put top guitar use.Bottom line : If n't mind extra effort n't plan keeping guitar using , maybe enjoy . For everyone else , look elsewhere . I bought I rebuilt guitar special would n't stay tune . I took number guys thinking I something wrong build . I use capo lot someone recommended ... I thought crazy . I 'm paying much capo I doubt problem . Well ... .I broke I 'm glad I . This thing amazing . It solved problem I set tension design make sit right strat . Spend money ... 's worth . Only con takes practice change quickly . This new type design capos , England ( warranteed life ) truly wonderful . Available six twelve string steel-string well new classical version , easy use , solidly built - perhaps importantly , easy put take one hand without retune ! For musician , element - , ' materials used manufacture good guitar . I use mine Martin HD28 problems whatsoever . A great move toward new generation capos ! Not cheap - worth every cent . Once get hang capo , 's wonderful . It takes bit get used squeezing correct tension.I several guitars - one I love using capo hard & # 34 ; V & # 34 ; neck . It 's pretty accurate neck 4th fret.Nice product . Worth investment . Now I figure keep ! ! ! This capo works acoustics well electrics no-fuss positive allows apply right pressure simply squeezing place . Holds notes securely marvelous clarity giving pure new guitar tuning whichever fret choose . simple also , press release tab 's ready remove , muss fuss , really work well . Highly recommend . This capo expensive , I never found one works well . It worth money opinion . I 've tried Kyser capos 're good . They work . This capo , however , works simply , smoothly , 's great pleasure operate . Like Seagull vs Taylor 8 series , work , one beauty . Made China , designed Europe , slippery , bit heavy , still , nice . It 's money I 'd liked paid , I 'm glad I . Did improve life ? Not . It also n't improve guitar playing - somehow 's much nicer capo I 've used . This capo expensive . The first time I ( everybody else ) saw one , I said , `` Wow . I get Kyser something fifteen bucks . Get . `` Five capos later , I realize I could probably shelled money , instead purchasing every capo market , one time , last fifteen years.The first last thing really needs said G7th -- n't put guitar tune . Virtually . I capo way seventh eighth fret tuner shows I 'm still within one light perfectly . That 's . Yes , G7th sleek beautiful , like tiny sculpture , look , sometimes I want stare . Yes , 's easy put , mere squeeze hand away perfectly place . Yes , appears sturdy enough . But tuning thing really sets one capo apart another , end day , one kills it.I three Shubbs , Kyser , Dunlop , one rolling capos . They 're good . I n't hate . But capo takes away uncertainty irritation fraction tune rest band , . It makes playing guitar capo effortless joy . As musicians , sometimes find right sound feel piece equipment changes everything taking performance new level . For happened I found right sound & feel Taylor acoustic guitar , right vocal mics , right mixer , Bose L1 Model II , I one finds . After years somewhat dissatisfied every capo I 've encountered I discovered perfect capo : G7th Performance Capo . I 'm kidding - one finds . As acoustic guitar player / vocalist , obviously , I play songs right key optimum vocal performance . This means occasionally relying capo get right key right chord shape/structure . Unfortunately , songs `` weak '' spots ( sending `` B '' list ) courtesy combination `` weaker '' chord ( due physical limitations ) & reduced sustain & tonal quality resulting using capo . This dissatisfaction `` capo quest '' ended today I found G7th Performance first thing I noticed I used G7th improved sustain every capo I 've used . All `` weak '' spots songs totally disappeared . I quickly dusted several songs `` B '' list & found improved sustain & tonal quality allowed move `` A '' problem weight capo ( others pointed heavier ) I ca n't detect change balance handling guitar ( I play sitting guitar stool guitar resting leg - perhaps someone standing using guitar strap might notice slight difference balance . ) I love `` self-ratcheting '' feature G7th . I thought reviews & videos I watched I 'd open end fairly firmly secure hold - NOT case . I think G7th right width & density foam top bar : ) providing `` friction '' hold capo place ; b ) playing role effectively dampening strings ; & c ) possibly gentle strings foam rubber top bar , thus less impact tuning.I find one slight negative capo I able quickly overcome . The end top metal bar ( open end capo ) slightly `` squared-off '' end bottom piece ( contrast rounded ) . It may way I play chords , hand contacting squared-off end top bar & getting irritated - I simply turned capo around open end facing ( versus facing floor ) & surfaces contacting hand far smoother - thus , zero irritation . This nothing new - I commented cost capo . For , cost capo nothing compared many thousands dollars I 've spent finding right guitars , PA 's , mics , & equipment / accessories . I almost ca n't believe cost $ 40 make difference sound . The G7th Performance Capo priceless ! ! ! Overall , I HIGHLY RECOMMEND capo - 're like - could inexpensive way take performance next level ! ! ! I 'm strong believer critical components I immediately purchase another G7th back-up ( maybe I 'll order black gold & use silver one back-up ) . This last Capo ever need buy unless need curved straight capos various fretboards case 'll still want stay G7th capos needs . No need worry damaging guitar neck tightening contact . No spring clamp wear & lose gripping strength produces buzz time . Low profile design easiest playability n't learn play around like Keyser . The unique , adjustable tension also allows control sound liking , great advanced tricks like strings . Ca n't say enough easy use tool ultra simple , unobtrusive design . Love one every case . Probably best capo I ever . It 's easy put holds strings well . Although always need check tuning putting capo guitar , one seems upset tuning much . I 'm impressed . The G7th Performance Capo far nicest capo I 35 years playing . The main using using capo throwing guitar tune every single time . Well , G7th Performance capo definitely Worlds best keeping guitar tune . It easy use . And holds strings completely easily . The G7th Performance Capo something definitely want lose . I 'm beginner I try learn play guitar . I looking many different capo 's one choice base folks review . Is easy apply small sexy ; - ) A friend mine guitar repair ( budding luthier ) recommended capo I mentioned intonation problems guitar ... I always issues , . The real problem began I switched different strings- silk steels . I LOVED tone I getting , intonation problems suddenly much worse.What I considered , friend mentioned , new strings provide tonal warmth I looking , also easier `` bend tune '' . ( Duh , I thought , makes perfect sense retrospect ! ) The capo I using putting WAY much pressure strings , greatly exacerbated existing issue ... one ultimately need taken repaired.So mentioned capo , I immediately . ( $ 50 bucks ? That 's much payed . Yikes ! ) Then grabbed G7 car let try . The strings stayed tune ! That 's $ 350 repair I pocket things , least time . I impressed ! I ordered one next day.I sure I miss able stick usual I playing live , really easy use general , I wo n't look back . The intonation issues greatly reduced , I thrilled.Worth every penny .

I prefer shorter one time , I use one often , well.Sure , spend slide , I see reason . I bought mistakenly getting model size 8 . This one actually fits , works great one acoustic electric .

Cheers ! ~J new playing slide guitar I lots fun one fragile care must taken drop ... would buy company I originally purchased large size found bit big , thus I wanted try medium .

Just guitar stand reasonably priced . If need one , might well one . I bought 3 ridiculously low price ... I figured I 'd get money 's worth regardless . They work fine . So well , I thought I would buy studio . The price went nearly 50 % though . . There fair number similar tripod guitar stands cost . If one pet U-shaped support falls carry assembled stand around , 'll especially like World Tour stand . The way U-shaped piece inserts makes far less susceptible falling . And , although , one reviewer put , `` minimalistic , '' stand substantial feel . I 'm quite happy purchase , would buy another World Tour , rather one brands I . Amazon.com great job , , getting . This stand nice , black job well . It also strap top holder secure guitar stand . It like added bonus .

752	It 's flange pedal , else ? For price I really happy . If I knew someone skilled I 'd get workings inside different case . The shape cool , I 'd feel safer metal casing . The button smaller I thought , 's issue ; 's kinda easier press ! As someone like starting get pedals , price see work want invest realm , I would recommend ! The regen control goes strong deep levels rumble floor lower end ( My fender excelsior 's 15 inch speaker rattled walls ) sweep give cool effect . I notice little tone suck pedal bypassed . Also , speed know great range 5+ second sweeps super fast leslie univibe like tones . The depth knob 's job . It n't manual knob move sweep , I leave depth way time 's big deal . For price , perfect trying discreet flanger pedal instead one built Vox modeling amp . star plastic ... otherwise excellent , YouTube many reviews , The FAB pedals great values , For flanger , perfect , great sounds great price . The Danelectro FAB series pedals offer great sound without digging budget . The Fab Flange effects pedal works great gives wobble phase shift would expect expensive unit ...

754	super beginners kit get ya going build ... pencil condenser questionable ... ... picked outside noise ( like birds etc ) decent bit white noise ( I may running bit hot ) strange clamps worked well I looking cheap way get drums miced hurry Saturday 's 's Day . I took chance kit , even though I never purchased anything says `` Pyle '' label . Upon receiving kit , first surprise quality case , upon opening , I surpised find EXACT microphones ones I borrowed friend recordings , branded differently . He paid kit ( still cheap today 's standards ) .I pulled 1 overhead condensor kick-drum mic mounted , fired PA drummer play bit shocked clarity overhead mic ! We could probably get away using one microphone mic entire kit , two overheads ; pick everything clearly . I turned volume kick-drum mic even surprised hear thump much expensive mic coming seemingly too-small mic . Now , I wonderful drum mix coming 2 microphones mixer channels free I would expected . For fun , I added one tom/snare mics sounded equally purchasing , I tell absolutely NO way I would purchase one `` high-end '' drum-mic kits . If looking solution recording live sound , . I promise LOVE sound ecstatic price paid get sound . Shipped time . Did n't test microphones yet , I think best price 7 microphones . According rewievs sound quality quite well . I 'll check later . The good : hardware need , drum mounts , 3/8 carrying kick mic good low frequency responseThe bad : Has locking clasps included keys , big key contain cabling easily spend much instructions use mounts , little things like use plyers remove 3/8 '' adapters mic needs mic stand , one providedThe ugly : The two condenser microphones incredibly sensitive cost incredibly high noise floor . There ton hiss level setting make recording sound like 1/4 '' tape unless EQ highs condensers kill . I used mics mic arsenal . The kick mic 's base beginning fall apart , I used things road ( brutal ) summer sound still ... I expensive mics , often use clubs backup ( drummer n't favorite bring kick mic ) . While stand say ( favorite ) D112 , job overheads easiest . mics I tried yet . The tom mics work guitar cabinets mounting hardware still one piece ( except kick mic mounting bracket ) months use . I would suggest mics backup expensive : Now I using I say reliable , durable sound good . My AKG drum mic kit sees action Pyle 's , Pyle mics always hand mic guitar cabs , percussion instruments like congas whatever else needs mic'ing . The kick drum mic 's mount falling , considering many times mics hit drum sticks dropped inexperienced technicians , great shape . These mics life left I gotten good amount use point . For money , I doubt beat microphones . I needed something occasional outdoor shows n't want spend ton money . So far , good . I say first shipment bad mic , Amazon replaced free paid re-shipping , I happy . 
755	I n't used yet , seems solid idiot proof - like I need . Play coffee shops help I drop pick . Very good price . Not much say - 's pic holder attaches music/mic stand holds advertised , indeed attach nicely easily snugly music/mic stands , , fact , snuggly easily hold worth small cost .

I went ahead ordered two I even chance buy , price dropped dollar . They easily fit mic stand save hassle trying bend find pick drop . Definitely smart buy . Do n't play another show without ! Love security picks within grasp ! Great product great value ! I would highly recommend others . Not much say really nice around . Hold picks tight need Just exactly stated , small rubber piece hook mic stand guitar stand . Holds 6 picks . It exactly I wanted great price . Thanks ! review say today I got thin picks `` thin '' picks hold . Mediums great thin fall right . Fine I keep medium thought might helpful information someone . How much say little piece rubber sticks mic stand ? ? ? First , great price - Big Mac ( LOL ) . Second , fits great & exactly 's supposed . Third , I use pick holder I wonder I never tendency break , drop even wear-out picks playing handy little device reduces tendency . I solid / heavier weighted stands `` stand-up '' quick grab pick holder . But using one cheaper tripod-style stands I make sure I 'm careful lightly barely insert picks holder I n't pull whole stand product - `` could n't live without '' ( LOL ) , 's NOT manufacturer 's fault I cheap light-weight stands ... . If 're looking pick holder I ca n't think reason try one . I 'm performing musician , I actually use guitar stand keep variety picks close hand . Holds everything .5mm nylon pick 3.1mm rubber pick , I yet see one fall . Simple solution simple problem . Fits standard mike stands.Stays supposed to.The perfect accessory stage studio.Will buy . 
756	This great mixer looking simple podcasting solo music production home . It 's great little unit . The set back use Condenser mics , without external phantom power supply , NO phantom power unit . You need get 802 model need phantom power , otherwise work fine regular XLR Hi-Z microphones . This little mixer handy around small headphone mixes , n't expect last forever typical Behringer products . At least 's cheap though ! I wish power switch ... ( This review legit ) I bought mixer back august september , cant really remember , horrible experience unit , 's fault , bought mixer without looking reviews anything , didnt know use it.I hooked desktop pink microphone input , got horrible , terrible mix , hiss fan ruined ( nearly panic attack ) , took like 9 months research , found behringer made uca202/uca222 unit 802 mixer , remove hiss unwanted buy uca202/uca222 clear recordings , buy `` rca 3.5mm cable '' using studio setting like , beginning like , let wealthy people fool , dont need thousand dollar , podcaststudio usb ( behringer ) would , cheap microphone radio shack mixer , quality good , hiss ruined ! ! ! ! ! Use usb audio interface behringer , , want 5 star audio quality ! Their website asio drivers assist , go YouTube search `` uca202 studio '' , 'll get videos , please , please , please research buy anything ! Good day everyone ! ; D I two Behringer mixers exceed expectations . Small yet clean versatile . Great gigging remote events . A great value money . I used one time far w/my stick served purpose fine . looking forward using future I read lots reviews Behringer , people buzz noises , etc case . I 'm professional I wanted good mixer connect , tascam , mobile sometimes I use Tascam record , mobile reproduce guitar mixer works great , NO noise , NO buzz , NO nothing working expected . Great product entry level great price get . For multi guitar owners , I think I looking , something patch guitars amp without drastic tone/volume single coil , another line humbucker , p90 guitar volumes . Excellent ... And space saver . Sure 's lot options , likely ill use , make guitar switching easy good deal . Needed mixer figured worth risk try inexpensive mixer . It limited job . I 'm rapidly becoming behringer fan . The three points mentioned another rating ( Inputs back , needs rubber feet , led ) spot . I 'd also like see another set outputs well . It could also use tad bigger , jammed everything small area knobs little close together . The LED power thing bright 's obnoxious , almost blinds . Other great affordable little mixer everything advertise ... I bought mixer order combine bass guitar mp3 player silent practice home . Bass one channel , iPod another , headphones works ! There solutions dilemma . headphone amps , . But 're ) expensive b ) kind junky c ) come equipped built-in effects amp models I want . YMMV . ) So 's Behringer XENYX like use scenario ? 1 . The blue power light blinding . First thing I put masking tape n't prevent seeing knobs . Speaking knobs , seem little rickety . Be careful jamming gig bag repeatedly . I worry knobs wo n't stand kind treatment . There 's on/off switch , 'll wind pulling power back unit 's use . Strange particular usage scenario.Overall , I think unit great value money . 
757	real leather strap nice price better thing I warm extra large person beer belly strap fit For price mostly comfortable sturdy build . It matches Epiphone Sheraton II well although n't & # 34 ; twist & # 34 ; easily ( neck strap pin backside guitar ) . This , price I paid Amazon ( far less currently selling ) good buy . At current price almost 30 bucks , I would pass look options . The leather attractive , thick enough , soft enough price , I found length long enough personally . I almost shortest possible setting far room let . Only really tall people , big people , `` low players '' disappointed perhaps . I complaints course complaints subjective YMMV . One , back side strap black . It 's color I n't realize . You see tiny bit color photo enough really get idea backside looks like . I assumed incorrectly sides black . Two , embossed design little tastes . All said , nice love . Quality right price . Easy adjust . Looks like last . Solid four stars despite personal opinion . I purchased one weeks back loved much I order another one . If want comfort , styple , good price , I highly recommend guitar straps . I n't like much . The back side shed settling . The leather rather soft . I 've purchased similar straps work better feel comfortable . This particular one ok . Would say best feeling strap look It little stiff feeling compared others I purchased overall nice . The material used fine . The looks fine . The length horrible . This short adults play guitar . It felt like I holding guitar around neck instead shoulders . I attached longest way possible well short I could use . To worthless purchase . I tucked drawer sit used . 
758	I bought put new strings guitar shipping info said wouldnt days . I restrung guitar without showed mail hours later . I say built much better I thought would . Feels like built last . Works fine . Except little knob 's supposed take parts hold strings ( little pins whatever ) n't grip onto mine ( I acoustic jasmine takkamine ) I get pliers toolbox , 's okay . One size n't always fit . Good price . It winds well cut excess string thereafter . The design also includes bridge pin puller comes handy . With acquired technique tool job . bought whim I glad , I used string winder part yet cutter makes short work guitar mandolin strings without risk marring head , careful pinch careful . Changed strings Epiphone EB-0 bass today first time using product.Fit extra large tuning pegs bass room spare . Cutter works great , winder makes job really fast . 10 minutes took 4 strings . Next time much faster know im . Highly recommended I wo n't rant string winder.. They n't technical item I like string cutter . I almost prefer pin puller cheaper units I going This unit works fine I sure I lose It I like product much I buy two time I wish I n't . The problem everyone else likes much ! So 's like guy asks lighter ... uses ... puts pocket every single time , also seem grow feet disappear like understand people tools work well convenient turns maybe contain stain pack catch like bank robbers.It 's decent tool good price buy one ... Then see long ! It works fine regular guitars bass guitar wide tuning pegs . This winder slot sorta fit across tuning peg n't feel like enough grip make turning easier.I n't chance actually use changing strings yet , far looks like 'll work advertised every aspect . This basically Leatherman Multi tool guitarist . By Leatherman , I really mean Planet Waves - The go , sure shot company provide solid guitar products accessories ( I buy cables , picks , straps Planet Waves so.. I guess could say I 'm fan company ) And multi-tool , I really mean Pro Winder String Winder Cutter . Everything need know title ! It helps wind guitar strings , grip comfortable durable , 've tuned guitar clip excess guitar string . Awesome ! But wait ...

The cutter real plus I n't track diagonal cutters . I honestly really n't find thing useful . First , wire clipper side relatively bulky ( flush cutting ) n't open easily ( stiff action ) , trying get clipper onto wire small opening time tool blocks view - . And winder ... I suppose heavy initial winding , get rather tiring twisting tuner . But tad big tuner pegs anything I used , nice & # 34 ; tight & # 34 ; fit , & # 34 ; jiggle & # 34 ; fit . Plus clearance needed actually swing thing around means instrument laying flat table n't help . Did n't even know bridge pin puller thing . Just looked ... guess notch peg winder time I set use , I end turning pegs manually stiff action wire cutters align string . I recently ended buying set Brand & Set ( pliers JUST thing pulling strings keeping tension winding ) . When I redo acoustic guitar , I 'll try notch bridge peg puller . But wise , thing gets serious two-star & # 34 ; meh & # 34 ; . A good piece kit . Except problems removing occasional sticky string pegs . It 's also squeakily noisy string winding . The cutter works perfectly . This winder cutter ... winds cuts fine ... But pin puller fit guitar pins even though ad claims , & # 34 ; ... fits virtually guitars , banjos mandolins ... & # 34 ; Oh well ... another learned . It works well guitars basses , long style . Other works like says . great little time saver needed restring one compact works well , pretty good buy . Sometimes seems convenient use hand turn pegs rather use , pretty good job . I really like string cutter built frame , peg puller favorite feature . Basically , I use everything except winding strings . When I first saw item I wondered : Why regular guitar version $ bass version $ 4.99 ? amazing clarity came I realized -- bass version tune FOUR strings instead six . So costs less n't need use much ! But I remembered 5 string bass guitars I thought , okay ... n't $ one 5-string bass guitars ? Sadly universal clarity became even muddied I realized dismay even 6-string bass guitars . Will even work 6-string bass ? After , 's 2 strings intended purpose ! These perplexing questions aside , I find excellent ideal tool . Its function three-fold:1 ) String winder2 ) String ) Peg pullerSo running wire clippers pull peg cut string . All tools need change strings one reasonably-priced tool . Made D'addario , quality lives brand . It 's solid , wire cutter peg puller well designed . It everything 's supposed , well good : Good strong well-designed unitCONS : The winder held single screw numerous reports screw coming unscrewed use . I would recommend putting drop super glue screw thread area secure screw prevent happening . Because design flaw 4 stars instead note reviews old four years ... appears device undergone design changes time . Some say head bowl deep result scratching guitar head . Others report shallow slips I believe mistake sell BASS GUITAR version page . From I reviews , appears folks inadvertently purchased BASS guitar version , indeed wide deep cup , realize . , two products listed two different pages clarity . It 's obvious reviews folks accidentally purchased wrong unit.Some reported peg puller `` metal '' scratching bridge . The one mine vinyl hard enough scratch bridge one n't careful -- holds true needle nose pliers.Bottom line responsibility user pay attention 're , n't get rush , aware need protect instrument using ANY modification tool . I suspect one going get hurry try change strings 0 60 5 seconds ... may wind damaging guitar . Turn light , put reading glasses necessary see ... take time device work fine . Be aware reading reviews many seem date ( dunno company n't simply start new listing redesigning device ) . Works advertised . The cutter makes thing really worth . If I lose , I 'm buying another ! 2 words required ? Handy little gadget . So much better using pliers remove bridge pins , nail clippers cut strings much easier wind strings thing . I 've got 10 guitars 3 basses change lot strings definitely makes less chore . Love Planet Waves stuff ! This product straight forward works 's side note - pretty loud squeak occurs winding strings . I 'm sure one I received . It n't cause problem product 's performance ... 's loud . 
759	This best cleaning product I 've ever used . Not I use maple rosewood fretboards , I also use headstock 's unfinished unfinished body Ukulele . What restores wood way gives much brilliant , beautiful lively tone . Really brings beauty true wood . Now every fretboard unfinished bit wood guitars looks beautiful brand new . method also useful . I n't know strict warning saying use maple fretboards ; I put Stratocaster 's maple fretboard looks beautiful . The thing differently made fretboard good shade darker . I also must add stuff wonderful smell ( nowhere near overpowering ) , clean lot dirt conjunction hydrating wood . Great stuff . Go ahead buy . It strange fingerboard products work well n't build , stink , cost much.I use household 's guitars basses . Works excellently , application bottle good though occasionally needs stir shake get lubricant applicator . By far best use neck guitar bass . easily absorbed frets , wipes right . A must keep wood looking fresh . So far still Made America . I using formula 65 guitar polish 40 years since time hair longer growing heavy metal . I 've polished many guitars multiple times . This gets grime fingerprints body neck keeping instrument looking like new . It works great acoustic electric , solid hollow body , acrylic lacquer finishes without streaking . It even cleans Finger Ease lubricants neck strings . I n't needed products separately neck strings since works great . I 'd say guitar rosewood fretboard , mandatory purchase prized possession . Just one bottle last years years . I also like fact utilizes prevent spills accidents . I used night & # 34 ; feed & # 34 ; rosewood Telecaster , difference night day . I hoping Lemon oil would I needed get crud guitar fingerboards , 's good . I suggest cleaning first let dry . Once clean , lemon oil good job sealing wood - even years playing taken toll . It 's good finish , place start . The product meant used maple . Do n't know , issue since instruments rosewood dark , exotic woods . So far , good . Makes fretboard feel like new ; best clean alcohol wipes first . I think woods appreciate treated oil ; especially dry environments . rosewood fingerboard great color ! Also works well bridge used fraction bottle . A great investment 'll last quite long time . Its really secure far spilling bottle . The bad thing squeeze really hard get oil . I 've old beginner Ukulele sitting closet years . I much nicer ones decided rather lend playing I 'd fix beginner uke . I took strings realized dull dry looking fret board become . I used product really soaked fast . Now looks beautiful . Very satisfied worked . It 's oil ... want ? Turn upside , squeeze hard , use & # 34 ; man & # 34 ; level strength soon tip darken , apply fret board back forth motion . wipe fret board clean take wet look away . Let sit hours dry rest way rubbing 's okay soak wood long 's momentary . Do n't saturate fretboard walk away , wood absorbs oil , much oil absorbed = fretboard wood becoming swollen , losing shape flatness . Not good situation.Lemon oil n't like oils , n't slippery kind makes things . It 's oil actually works like solvent , cleaning things making sqeaky clean ... frets ... hint sure buff excess put little string lubricant frets re-string 'll happy camper . I love stuff . I 've tried many fretboard string cleaners one works best . And case wondering , comes cloth cap attached bottle twist cap turn bottle upside clean away . You may need additional cloth beginning wipe excess liquid bottle full first get ( course ) . I highly recommend product . This make fretboard smile ! It takes dry , faded , fretboard makes look like new . A goes long way 4 ounce bottle last long time . If fretboard really dry & faded , apply heavily allow soak . applying board stops absorbing wipe dry . I amazed made dull & faded 40 year old Fender fretboard came back life . I love stuff fretboards , except unusually dirty ones . If super , clean something stronger , stuff . Leaves wood new looking without greasy feel . I usually apply twice row wipe clean time . Works great - keeps fretboards looking great . Even though I change strings frequently twelve ( 12 ) acoustic electric guitars bottle last forever . I play hard several hours almost every day I 'm always amazed & # 34 ; crud & # 34 ; fretboards . ( Guess I 'll stop eating I 'm playing - kidding ... ) This oil breaks & # 34 ; crud & # 34 ; restores look fretboard new condition . No issues / problems positive things say oil ... I quite guitars I like keep clean polished . This stuff great fretboard I use every time I change strings . Lemon known quite generations good cleaning solvent acidic nature certainly job . As label warns : NOT use frets ( mostly Fender strats ) due softer & lighter quality . It harder , darker woods like mahogany ( I ) ebony ( high quality - i.e . expensive - used best fretless ) . The solution perfect , applicator ( attached neck bottle ) could better . I would rather take neck applicator apply lightly using 100 % cotton solution made specifically use guitars , though I think could find similar lemon oil cleaner cheaper local stores . It 's , little used time , bottle last guitar owner his/her life . This lemon oil used cleaning conditioning rosewood fingerboards guitars . This gets done year average guitar , 're like , one bottle supply many . Other , says . The applicator contains valve push hard open want oil label says NOT use product maple fingerboards . Does n't say , guess discolor , forewarned .

The bottom clamp never secure properly . It kept opening even without mic . The weight stand stripped it.I sent back without hesitation . I bought many professional mic stands years , item , I tell difference . Well built , made last , looks great . I highly recommend item . 
761	Holy , amp ... I terrified first I plugged turned NO batteries foolish purchase , decided try electric kazoo plugged HAVE LIFT OFF ! So rocking.I actually got acoustic-electric ukulele sounds beautiful . I keep volume low door open 1 & # 34 ; get tone . Have n't cranked yet dirty blues sound I 'm sure 'll sound awesome . First , I say reason I bought two pot belly pigs live house ... no-brainer purchase fan pigs , I play guitar too.Now review.This little & # 34 ; collector & # 34 ; amp turns something I actually use rather put shelf look pig stuff.I surprised well built . It 's solid rock chrome handles , edge guards pig snout volume looks like mini suit case contrary another review , AC adapter fits compartment inside may stored internally . It also operates batteries makes little thing quite gem take us summer . Now I take Fender Gibson electrics rather , I keep getting topic ... The sound clear crisp 's size . Sure , 's Fender Mustang IV , I n't pay 600 bucks either . But Fender n't pig 's snout ! ! There controls tone adjustments , volume knob . But , modern electric guitars quite bit tone adjustment anyway . I would compare sound coming average 's novelty amp real , anyway.As 's size , I would say 's size average small jewelry box . But 's much heavier , deceptively heavy I like . It n't & # 34 ; cheap & # 34 ; feel I said , I WILL use occasionally , especially summer months cruise conversion van . I look forward comments amp get , I 'm sure way guitar playing skills I still lot learn . But , learning fun little amp another way make even summary , I would highly recommend pig lover owns guitar anyone 's looking portable amp operates either batteries AC word best describe ... . & # 34 ; COOL & # 34 ; . I amp quite time find exactly I want ! It much easier carry around needs outlet . Turn half way , get clean sound ... crank maxed get distortion made famous . I piece legend music history ! Put away effects pedals , , software awhile get back earth - least simple appreciation electric guitar sound , straight axe nothing pickups , volume , tone pots shape it.For classic sound opening `` I Looked Away '' , I 'm sure everyone 's got enough `` feel air '' coax variety distorted tones . Stick SM-57 front fool lot people thinking 's tube amp . By working guitar knobs get clean sound , along `` barely breaking '' holy grail tone many blues rock players.By learning much relatively little , 'll gain new appreciation strengths weaknesses tone-shaping tools come along since.It might surprise take today 's , metal distortion granted official , guitar tone discover pleasure touch response subtle dynamics without infinite sustain.One bit weirdness : When I began playing Pignose I immediately noticed buzz , though something small rattling around speaker cone front grill . The four mounting nuts easy loosen , sure enough , extra washer gotten caught assembly . Fortunately slid right power adapter save batteries absolutely first amp I ever small Ampeg tube early 60 's single 6 inch speaker , volume tone knobs . I 've idea many watts put - enough parents complain bedroom next door . With baby cranked , I spent many happy hours tone heaven . All years ( amps ) later I guess I 've always searching sound Pignose comes closer tube distortion , blues overdrive pedal rat-ty box I 've tried.For money , ca n't beat . Fantastic . Just love little first thought broken , batteries sitting right.Very happy 's ok . Sounds simply great ! As greasy Pignose simple . Great bass notes also get clean highs ; sound different opened moving guitar volume , changes distortion ( louder , distorted ) . The Pignose power supply ( Pignose Power Supply Pignose ) helpful home , also works 6 AA batteries . You also amplify 's sound connecting amp . It comes really nice looking stickers . I 'm planning keep years.Update review ( 9 , 2013 ) .I admit might expensive 5 watt amps , time goes , I fall love Piggy ! I 've learned use better 's volume combined amps higher power get LOT louder Pignose , I LOVE level distortion gives ; I get crunch amps , matter much pedals , bells , whistles I tried ... This crunch unique world loves , simple plain . The good thing output back connect louder amps like louder volumes unique crunch I much fell love with.The 7 chords give clean amazing sweet-grumble ( one make teenage girls sigh ... ) high volume Piggy low guitar . I n't know little battery powered amp could sound good . It sounds good better Roland Cube 20 , course without effects , still , great little amp practice little gig family friends . Puts pretty good power little 5w . Has great sound opinion . The Pignose world 's best travel amp , portable amp , practice amp . It 's good vocals , 's inefficient , old design , distorts way easy . There far better amps purposes Boss others deliver lot clean volume , thanks modern amp technology , variety digital effects ... one area prevails . If 're looking sound big overdriven amp studio , miked stage , Pignose give sound less cost one good quality overdrive pedal . By opening closing box , get range cabinet sounds open-back Fender classic sealed cab , everything . Frank Zappa recorded lot guitar parts using nothing SG running Pignose , got fantastic sounds.Beyond , 's cool looking , reasonably rugged , even pegs allow hang guitar strap . Every rocker needs one . The previous reviews pretty accurate , though I would add Pignose cabinet closed , often sound rather boxy . It sounded much clearer cleaner opened couple using pedals , take distortion degree . It reaches point , pushed hard , definition distortion begin turning mushy shrill . You use distortion + overdrive decent effect , especially running cleaner sounding OD like Tube Screamer . I n't think would well Bad Monkey , example , though , dirt tones produces . I n't fuzz box ( yet , one order ) , I think fuzzes sound like crap unless use relatively cleaner , sweeter one like Red Witch Fuzz God Seymour Duncan Tweak Fuzz . Otherwise , hear much ground sound.My wah wah , Morley Power Wah , almost useless . The limited frequency response 5 '' speaker made sound overly throaty cleans I put boost shrillness would show chorus pedal sounds totally sweet , phaser , case , Phase 90 , destroys sound . A flanger also really . You use delay , rapid repeats . Putting compressor front clean signal would probably make manageable Pignose ' speaker . I bought Dynacomp , n't tried good cheap first amp buy youngster beginning journey guitar practice road vacation business . Once young seems dedicated , though , time think moving VOX AC15C1 ( note : amp hard rock fine , high gain metal ) ENGL Screamer . I personally ca n't imagine recording , Y guess would depend engineering skills available . 
762	Unless taste really thin picks , material thickness suffice uses , single-line leads strumming . This pick finally got away old favorite Fender tortoise mediums , though I still keep around . I bought whim . I pretty satisfied extra heavy picks I using , wanted something grip . These picks logo company name molded , gives purchase pickin fingers hold pick . This seems perfect thickness guitars silk steel strings . With xtra heavy picks I losing little treble strings . With little purple wonder I got treble back still great control playing fast playing like much I bought another hundred case purple pick monster eats great pick , delrin whatever ( ) generic name give avoid trademark issues , best plastic picks book . The tone superb ease holding wonderful . I keep couple guitar recommend enjoy playing guitar enjoy owning things purple colored . They n't taste like however . If prone losing guitar picks , good set 10 picks around choice single color per pack . The quality bit better cheap fishbowl picks music store , good favorite picks , Dunlop Big Stubby Picks , 2.0mm . They comfortable use . The Planet Wave logo gives nice grip pick ; I like heavy picks , `` heavy '' option fits preference . I 've got gig tomorrow night , 'll see work . The Planet Waves 25 Standard Delflex Guitar Picks sound good easier hold . They durable . I always happy Planet Waves products . These great picks , YES , slippery.The reason material , method manufacturing : Delflex polymer picks injection molded blend , making extremely durable bright sounding . Unlike stamped picks , manufactured sheet film different feel rotated , injection molded picks flexibility probably brightest sounding picks I ever used , well worth hanging them.I use 10 's solid body electrics , 11 's semi hollow bodies , Bass guitar ; 's right , I use plectrum get pick easier hang , may give away bright snap softer hang material like Nylon . 
763	This second Fender Polish Cloth . They basic , 's I need quick wipe instrument I 'm done playing . The slight negative fact tend unravel around edges . Even though happened , n't keep buying second one . The fact basic inexpensive good enough . It gets softer time use . Overall I say I 'm satisfied Fender Polish Cloth . love waxing em protected ... stay every case ... works well keep finger prints ... make couple different sizes ... price work fine ... enjoy Great price high-quality polishing much else say - polishes guitar nicely . Item arrived described time - Way larger expected , son loved ! Says 's easier use smaller cloths 've gotten . use cloth often polish guitar . The fender logo makes look legit . Recommended one . This cloth perfect wiping guitar playing session . A guitar investment protect . A good polish cloth must . 
764	There good mics great price helped recording Tascam 4 track cassette ( I like using occasion vs digital ) plain useful many apps ... ... excellent budget dynamic mics sweet case storage ! ! ! These microphones quality-feel worked perfectly . I used PA system I disappointed . They n't come cables sure available ( xlr-xlr ) . You get 25 ' cable $ 5 also Amazon . Good deal around . Would hesitate purchase I need . These mics great . I n't sure would like I would buy . They cheap enough replace sound great . We Shure mics needed repaired time . These bigger sound pick area problems . pack rocks quality feels sturdy I next shure mics cost sound karaoke vocals . I bough two sets 20 ft cables I 've Behringer mikes , currently couple , reliable comparable Shure SM 58s . I saw three pack 1800s $ 40 hard case could n't believe . I hooked right beside 2000s , little difference , 's much . The 1800 little high end , 's easy adjust tone slightly bass . The presence also boosted little 1800 , meaning less reverb put mix avoid tinny sound possibility , I 'm using matched 1800s main mikes vocalists , keeping older 2000s bought 3 less price one SM 58 . Although Shure ( B 2000 ) better , difference hardly noticeable tone presence compensated . I afford buy another 3 pack complete wise choice budget conscious . I got yesterday , everything alright , except two three Mics worked . One dead . I tested three , different cable , made sure switch . It first mic I tested three , dead one three . Everything good except one Microphone . These pretty standard dynamic mics , pay quality good . I use room mics mainly , perform admirably . I 've used ( backup ) vocals , results good . Would recommend folks budget . Also , case nice . Made metal , looks feels well made . Sounds clear hum buzz comes nice case plus . Great bargain price . 3 great vocal microphones , protective case , holders . Not top end ... general purpose use abuse ... works fine . Sensitivity clarity acceptable needs . Feels quite solid . The 3-pack FANTASTIC deal . I 've around mics $ 100 30 years , compared mics $ $ 100 range , good better ! Good lows clean highs without ANY hiss . Absolutely NO whine hiss used mic preamp . Do n't miss GREAT deal . Surprised really . For price I dont think I could done better . Nice case , come stand adapters , make sound pretty good I cant really sing . Dropped one times still working . Good . On switches . I record DAW recordings sound fine . I usually run everything BBE might part I pleased I recocmmend mics price range . These n't sound great stage rehearsal SM58s Beta 58s band situation , actually n't purpose microphones ... real purpose speech ceiling speaker system , . The facility use , mics habit walking away , escaping maybe ... stolen ? Perhaps . They sound great ceiling , on/off switches , 're cheap , buy another box 3 months 're 1 . Seems like 'll last forever , bad keep wandering us . I love microphones , I really . I also believe really cool threw microphone holders case quite nice . The 2 things I like 1 , microphone really close mouth get good sound , otherwise sound crisp . 2 , although nice include microphone holders , items work limited make sure match microphone stand want buy else wo n't screw . It good aware wire connects microphone XLR Female , buy correct wire connecting . For price I really recommend , long fine put microphone centered , close mouth . Overall great product . Pros : build quality-Included flight case , mic clips , adapters ( 3/8 & # 34 ; female threads 5/8 & # 34 ; male threads ) -Clean live sound : -Limited upper frequency response -- expected almost dynamic mics . Podcasting bit budget ( $ 200 setup ) , I wanted good sound quality , nice warm tones ... . mics deliver world I n't quite cash condensers I wanted . I needed four mics best cheap option word , sound great . 3 $ 40 fantastic . I glad I n't break budget . I 'm using Behringer 1202FX mixer . I extremely happy . These microphones great recording vocals . They pick local sounds better pick distance sounds . They detectable noise issues . Depending situation , may need external pop-filter windscreen , however , microphones contain internal windscreen . I use parties work good price I paid . I really complaints aside sometimes really get get good clear voice live band setting . I use wireless , still price , hard beat . I bought supplemental mics podcast , verbal audio recordings . The sound quality good mics , fact hard distinguish difference mixers higher end mics . They feel good hand , nice build quality , put windscreen little pop . Sensitivity good , I 'm pleased purchase . I 'd definitely recommend kind audio recording , may even good option instrument recording given lower price tag . NOTE : put pop screens , longer fit carry case . You remove wind screens modify cushioning inside case . If 're professional 're JOB music , may think mics standards quality . However , 're job ... even want mics PA system , 's really hard beat get deal . The deal fantastic . I use recording music home well recording online radio show 've perfect . Plugged 'em PA 's Yamaha mixer tried effects processor sound great ! Better Nady Starpower mic I also bought Amazon . These seem like last I plan buy long stay price . This item received well packed time . Provides great sound needs would recommend . I band mates seem respect Shure SM-58 mics well I bought cheap mics use . I surprised find I like sound voice better one old reliable SM-58 ( Behringer mic 's price problem feedback handling problem electronic carrying 's like ? My band PA mics anything . While I admit quality band work , fill stands affordable price . Not much distance -- & # 34 ; eat & # 34 ; mics -- sound great . Full range , clear ( muddy ) , breaking sound . This great place begin . Comes really nice case . Works great . Great price . Very light . Ca n't speak durability n't long n't used heavily . I looking good deal . The price reasonable , I said , `` How something cheap good '' , great investment . I use time people ask I purchased great sounding microphone . When I told price , thought I pulling leg , ..I n't . The case plastic , foam clips . Three good clips would cost ten dollars alone , compare . I 'd buy heart beat . I might buy another 3-pack ! ! Okay well I lied subject line , bad singers sound bad whatever mic put hand . I say authority since I run shows 6 nights week last 20+ years , I know good singers I hear . And ask I shure SM58 , reply Hell No , think I 'm going put 58 hands careless drunk ? The drink better sound believe . Some also drop mic worse , spike mic . I 'd rather lose one Behringers 58 . Or wireless 58 . Sound wise great intended purpose . If need sturdy metal cheap mic , bargain . I bought 45 dollars . Use small music gigs uses . They great DJ uses things quality voice n't important , long heard understood . I recommend use : 1 . Small music venues ( smaller bands ) , Djing , public speaking , band practices/rehearses , etc.For higher quality microphones reasonable price , look Audix 's around 80 bucks , Audio Technica products . Excellent equipment ! For price I paid , ca n't beat I got . Have used three exactly zero problems . It 's several years , name move forward sound equipment . Order time replace microphones well deserved retiring . I n't think mikes would give quality sound I needed price paid . 
765	These strings fit Bill perfectly `` MY '' desired sound Yamaha LJ-16 Acoustic Guitar `` '' Bone Saddle , Pins nut . When I decided put money guitar , belief Elixir Strings would continue provide sound feel I like much LJ-16 work completed ... ... proved true form . I move Medium little improvement Bass side 's outstanding sound medium price , hand crafted guitar . Elixir best ( comfortable ) feel , , strings I 've tested provide best ( liking ) sound guitar . Try 's quality sound 're looking ... ... ... ... great ! ! ! ! WAY better stock strings I received Fender acoustic . I beginner guitar player , I definitely able hear much brighter tone felt little better fingers . These strings second choice Elixir 80/20 Bronze . They warmer sounding , well balanced . Cost lot well worth . Guess open box dented box stuff inside seemed ok. Will need check next week . Strings accoustic old , probably corroded . It time replace strings . These great , job . I absolutely gripes Elixir nanoweb phosphor bronze strings . I using since first appeared scene become go-to brand . I 've read many reviews people complain sting breakage . I yet ever break Elixir acoustic guitar string ( 10 years playing ) . Ca n't even imagine . The coated string may little better Clear Tone -- I cost , I go Elixir never disappointed . I 'm fan `` Polyweb '' much visible thick coating . The get right -- last long time , sound great , far I know n't polymer dust . 
766	These strings bright full . They sound great couple weeks get bit dead . I n't problems breakage , loss tone time ( seems faster strings I 've tried ) . As guitarist 's opportunity work Guitar Center ( back ) , trying type string market fairly inexpensive easy task . While I 'll chose D'Addario EXL 's electric , Martin SP top choice acoustic . The sound reliability unmatched money . They also neat bronze shimmer ... Granted 's aesthetic . Ive trying different strings years ! ! ! Ive stuck elixirs time wanted change . These bright clean ! ! ! ! playable ! ! ! I tried different brands weights strings search ones would give guitar clear , bright , yet robust sound , I found Martin 4050 SP strings . I knew I found , & # 34 ; strings & # 34 ; short time playing . They light fingers , sound great , priced right . Martin makes variety good sounding strings , toward light end . The sound bright , lacks fullness found heavier strings MSP4150 SP Phosphor Bronze Acoustic Guitar Strings , custom light easier play bright tone , make guitar sound like cheaper model compared . Some disadvantages thinner strings limit dynamics . If strum harder , stretchy tuning less consistent , changing tone reason `` bend '' would . If play fairly consistent sound level expect bright sound resonant hand , compared brands sound , brightness make instrument sound quite style , might good choice . If used playing solid body electric lighter feel strings make medium strings uncomfortable , might seem home . If used Martin medium strings , want something play extra hours day without feeling things , might like , pick guitar Martin Medium strings , may find even cheaper guitar sounds better comparison upscale one.I would n't say I dislike , I would n't quite say gave five stars oversold , may deserve five stars particular needs . But around choice , better sounding ones Martin . But 's moot point n't feel comfortable playing . Make sure read variety reviews deciding equally valid viewpoints player unique . 
767	Needed cable hook Dean EVO practice amp . Ca n't complain ; 's pretty nice , standard instrument cable makes guitar sound clean loud , I wanted . These cables made top quality components assembled USA . I one like Neutrik connectors ( gave away gift ) two G & H ; Show Saver connector option . This makes similar boutique cables cost three times price.These cables well-balanced articulate mids highs tight bass . They well-shielded , look nice , handle well.You could pay gold plating slightly better corrosion resistance woven make wire look cute , want . This cheaply built cable . It basic ends , screw seem come loose need tightening frequently . The truly redeeming feature cable 's tiny length : 3 feet . I use Honey Tone portable Honey Tone Mini Amp Aqua , cable short . The amp belt . I use , thus , like Jackson , reviewers . Like Jackson , I solid body electric ukulele.Let say , three feet short , short . If want put amp floor , 'd better ( ) short , ( b ) siting right , find limiting three feet cable really , 'll recognize use one thing : portable amp , close suppose could use connect couple guitar pedals much cable , , connector cables even shorter.Glad I purpose I intended . Wish , stronger , better looking , like guitar cables . I bought replace cruddy cables came all-in-one . kit finally went , price , ca n't beat . I 'd even pay lot . Do n't let off-brand name put . Go ahead get - 'll glad did.I 'm using mine Strat straight amp , also effects pedals , work great : added hiss noise , pops cracks , nothing . Perfectly quiet cables deliver signal guitar full strength without 'em . I home studio needed extra cables three guitars keyboard . I wanted plugged ready go without switch cables time . So , I tried cable works perfectly . Very heavy cord top quality construction . Ca n't beat price either . Will buy . Works great , I needed walk room . Now I sit chair 
768	Ok , I buy another item 2 items cart `` add-on '' items . I needed another microphone I toying idea purchasing GLS mic . I 'm extremely happy I took chance , soon I submit review , I 'm purchasing another . This best price/value purchase I 've made long time . I 'm going insult say 's well-known mic looks , ears everybody else 's listened mic , sounds clear clean little hotter SM 58 . I used play show Friday , performed wonderfully . The sound guy thought SM 58 . I definitely buy couple well mic amps . Now , things may change year mic n't hold , hefty solid , seems built like tank . Now , I dripping money , maybe I would stick `` industry standard , '' buy dollar ratio , Earth I ? update : I must say venues , 'll really tweak EQ order stop feedback . So great value , feedback situations Sennheisers ( 4 times price . . . ) . This mic strong , reliable produces sound I 'm looking . I used buy Shure products , ,I 'm switching great ! I would n't consider $ 30 backup mic , I would consider professional vocal mic . Period . This great mic ! Out box , nice weight . It sounds slightly hotter say , Shure SM58 ; I like much . I typically like stand back mic I sing live seems work well vocals technique . I also tested mic harmonica well . Seriously ... I n't work company ties whatsoever . I 'm dude band . Trust one . Yes ie every bit good Shure SM 58 n't get cool pouch . The 57 version also like Shure . Great sound great deal . ( yes I musician ) I skeptical mic cheap I use band several Shure mics I cant tell difference pa mix sound same..I plan getting . I bought cheap figured ca n't bad . I surprised good . I shure mic professional singer could n't tell difference . love switch sound great little feedback , would purchase mic . To ears , SM58 . It sounds identical . Someone super human ears tell otherwise may right , I recording music years mic good shure mic I 's half ( less ) cost . 
769	I initially thought would wimpy sounding . I wrong . They great tone metal distortion pedal . I Schecter Hellraiser EMG X Series pickups go great . They easier bend great . I longer use heavier strings like I use . These mainstay . I n't put every guitar right guitar perfect . What 's right guitar ? Longer scales- like strat . I would put shorter scale ( 22 '' ) would get flubby . If hit power chords hard may also want stear require bit subtlety attack vibrate tune low E pulling windmills like . They allow super easy string bends I feel lazy fingers torn playing . YMMV . I n't know people n't use : 're amazing . I 've used many strings owned many guitars . These n't gretsch 're fantastic . I love strats . The last make playing breeze . I n't tone loss .10 's . If I 's made fact I play better lighter strings . Strings rust easily , yield fairly poor tone break often , though bending ability . These strings beyond amazing . Switching Ernie Ball strings matter course purchasing new electric guitar , blues playing , Extra Slinkies . They bend bend bend , easy fingers lengthy solos , give great sound whether 're playing gritty bright . I also play country punk , strings let get enough twang beef , respectively , play styles well . The best $ 5 ever spend guitar improvement put Ernie Ball strings guitar . I 've playing guitar years lately I 've wanting slinkier strings I get little bend . I thought I 'd try I loved . After playing week I loved way played I loved way sound . So I ordered 6 packs . The extra slinky strings fantastic definitely wo n't find better set strings money . sounding , break easily . I would recommend anyone literally developed . Great strings , I use Ernie Ball strings 7 guitars , acoustic electric never complaint . I experimented others always come back . I cant get enough sustain high taste . Tried Epi LP PRS . I 'm Eric Clapton , I dont use 4 amp heads I employ 3 guys work guitars , thats impression . Just enough umph ... These favorite guitars strings , last long time , bend well , hold great sound , wo n't tune guitar every five minutes like strings . 
770	I ran across thing weeks ago decided give try . I 'd looking boom attachment stand I play guitar sing . This seemed perfect , . Regular booms always necessary , book . They helpful , also take much `` air space '' cramped stages small rehearsal spaces . This thing gives plenty room get stand way without making annoyance . The thing I like elbow adjusts teeth , 're tightening joint relying friction - kind things eventually fail tightening bolt gets tired.Anyway - reservations one . A idea works great . This item works well keeping mic away stand allowing room guitars . I tried flexible goose neck way loose would hold mic steady . The locking teeth adjuster firmly hold stand 1 position . The short extension picture unit I received really needed works fine delivered . I would purchase unit . It good piece good deal ! This tough unit , easy set locks tight . The materials robust.In home studio never lot room I n't want big boom hanging side mic stand . This fit bill perfectly . On package used end long boom hang mic perfect possition , yeah , one could totally this.This simple device corners cut manufacture . This little gadget perfect want stand back mic stand far enough make comfortable play guitar sing mic . The usual solution get boom attach stand works 's simpler , less expensive takes less space . The pivot controlled friction joint adjust . I would n't try use I singing drummer , guitarist , 's great . Well built . The adjuster end deeply notched set wide range angles 8 9 degree . ( 10 possible positions upright horizontal ) Best setting drum mics would hold position better gooseneck . I 'm using vocal mic application pushes mic tad away stand give bit room . But counter-weight best used shallow angles . If I playing thicker instrument like acoustic guitar , on-stage energy moving lot , I would opt boom stand instead . One conventional booms broke cheap plastic parts could n't handle stress tightened repeatedly . I came across reading reviews figured I n't much lose $ 7 price tag . I glad I made purchase I 'm going order couple model 13 '' model . It 's steel construction except oversized nylon knob used adjust angle hold boom place . It 's solidly built I n't imagine break easily . The two pieces move teeth , angle set knob tightened , slip . Get 13 '' want reach amps sitting floor conventional stand . 7 '' great allows sing acoustic guitar without extra length . I play guitar 's necessary mic angled toward sing . Long boom mics make small stages bit negotiate . This little boom gives way get close mic without long boom cluttering stage . Great product ! 
771	The Taylor strap nice works like strap . You notice slip around shoulder like nylon cheap straps . I bought complement ( 2011 ) guitar , wanted something would last long time , provide nice suede feel keep strap sliding around shoulder.It took little bit get hole butt peg guitar - almost seemed slit cut small . After working minutes , I got fit , wore really nicely I got length I wanted . Taking on/off guitar n't much trouble , past months bottom slit stretched little - enough make easier get . I 'm glad came little tighter initially - leather stretches time , 's clear mind make . The quality excellent , I 'm buying another one go 12-string Taylor . I bought strap Taylor guitar.It 's fine strap feels really comfortable soft.As says , made fit well Taylor guitars fit guitar well.The color pretty much picture posted.Highly recommended Nice see something well made change . Most guitar straps I see less $ cheap fake stuff . This strap genuine suede leather , really comfortable lots friction , sliding around shoulders I 'm playing . It 's plenty long guitar size shoulder width , adjusting like leather straps . Taylor logo makes look good bad say strap . 
772	This really cheap microphone . I 'm usually amazed good & # 34 ; cheap & # 34 ; mics sound ( e.g . shure line fantastic ) , I 'm amazed mic . It sounds like cheap mic . It handles high sound pressure ok , sounds & # 34 ; tinny & # 34 ; prone feedback nicer price , however , expect : - Price . This essentially toy.- Stand cable ! : - Sound quality . Maybe want & # 34 ; lo-fi & # 34 ; sound ? You could make work.Overall , really good bargain extra back-up kids mic . It horrible mic . It usable applications like speaking . For music recording , however , 'll notice cheap mic . Good quality price , It 's mic stand . Plug amp , computer sound card , karaoke machine , whatever , belt favorite tune . Is bestest sounding microphone planet ? No , friend . It . Sorry . But perfectly adequate purposes . The stand comes light I would n't subject much abuse ( n't invite Pop , 's rough mic stands ) job admirably want something hold mic wave hands air like n't care . And 're gon na , right ? Good quality price . It exceeded expectations . I expected something bit flimsy , surprised find heavy duty . Sadly , I ca n't review mic cable comes mic non-responsive . I tried mic cables I lying around I know work , I got nothing ; like mic n't plugged . And cable included pack , well , plastic ( metal ) connector mic cracked . I still tried difference mic ... static.I ca n't blame Amazon broken bits whole thing packed well box appear stand comes set seems really good price whole package . I impressed much ... I ca n't recommend product . I feel every microphone great compare nothing . It works great thank , Nady Amazon . It 's compact great use . My son daughter love playing mic stand . It comes cord standard 1/4 inch end . I plugged small guitar amp . They use mainly sing along 's . Note really mic I would use studio - toy honest , quality toy young child . In regard I give five stars . Although hardly high-end microphone , fully functional amplification voice instrument , although output signal seems like could stronger . The stand sturdy , . So , probably best choice full-time professional musician , around playing clubs , 's worth look . The mic loud voice Karaoke . The stand makes setting professional . You feel different stand holding mic . This low cost , compact microphone stand perfect local speaking engagements . I connect portable 20 watt amp provides sound I need intimate settings . The stand surprisingly stable good quality . This great quality microphone . But 's I expecting I paid $ 25 mic stand . I bought group kids worship school . I need less expensive equipment ' . So works well . 
773	This came mail today rather large box . The blue LED light fine , put 5 medium picks Pick holder . More enough keep friend picks songs . It bad I n't think I would purchase another one . This unique gift put big smile male teen musician home made smile . Great use hold guitar pick use find keys open door with.My son likes uses often I intended carry , keys , attached chain wallet . But wallet n't arrived yet warned little bit pocket space . But I suspected would I ordered I n't count . Holds 3 medium picks grip exceptionally tight ... almost annoyingly hard get one . Will sure update wear & tear effect grip picks . But far , great would consider purchasing musically inclined friends . I clip pick holder music stand 's always handy , easy use . I use thin picks able fit four holder .

775	Bought gift . Friend loved much . I love BOSS pedals . I owned DS-1 ( Distortion ) MT-2 ( Metal Zone ) years , loved . This one , good `` meet middle '' two . It 's great want really good bluesy distortion , crank color get thick always , pedal well constructed sturdy . I love . This pedal mainstay effects years . It really ton range , although one effect time , 'd reach change knobs order get variations . My commonly used setting mix knob 2 o'clock , produces professional sounding effect . If want 90 's sounds , excluding heavier metal sounds , pedal definitely get . simple , user-friendly , feature important think , versatile . drive knobs allow chose different bunch tones . also , money , great deal . 100 % recommended . I first used pedal green screemer died . A friend hand let use . I used Boss 's metal zone produced nasal tone liking . So I plug OS-2 I pleasently impressed range distortion overdrive OS-2 pedal produced . I play '59 fender bassman mix tubes pedal produce sweet tones . I also played pedal solid state amp I still impressed . I spent years searching pedal could produce nice tight warm low bottom end , search ended pedal . I highly recomend pedal rock , blues , metal , country , punk guitar player . 
776	My partner wo n't put pickup guitar I get tires ' amp around ( along rest sys ) trick . Clip boom stand , stick SM 57 SM 58 sing set . Holds tight . The one I got much neon yellow rubber thing tip screw . I feel like I tighten much , I could dent mic stand tube . But I n't dented anything yet , perhaps I 'm skeptical . In event , seems like better design might make easier get attachments tightened facing right direction . But everything works . It 's getting job done I n't seen better option . All , pretty good device . I use mount hi-hat cymbal stands , well mic stands . See customer-supplied photos top page thing I love extension bar fit relatively large diameter tubes hi-hat stands . I use anOn Stage Microphone 13-inch Gooseneck , Blackto connect bar , I attach either aNady DM70 Drum Instrument Microphoneor DM80 microphone . The bar-gooseneck arrangement sturdy enough mic model.This also works well mounting microphone stands . I use shorter gooseneck mount DM70 tenor alto saxophones , DM80 baritones . Again , works perfectly situations.I always keep , plus various size goosenecks , case I need mount additional microphone I short stands . It 's one tool make set less stressful . I use mount portable digital recorder onto side mic stand . Very stable clamp mechanism , works well . Price good . Nice gadget bag . I crowded rig already las thing I wanted another mic stand . I already straight stand Shure mounted talkback call tunes band members . I wanted eliminate wireless sax mic , I using infrequently , decided mount Heil Fin extension arm stand talkback . Nice stable - issues - works perfectly . I tried iPad . It kinda wobbles . It light strip metal without bracing design flaps something heavy attached end iPad . I recommend something light weight . There 's better ones . See review music stand . That comes solid extension arm ... OK , cheap ( nine bucks time ) , design looked good sensible , seemed perfect solution real need . I bought without hesitation . HOWEVER ( ! ) , hooked , I surprised flimsy . I 13 '' gooseneck , light condenser mic small shock-mount . At slightest movement mic stand attachment flaps like crazy continue way something like minute stopped hand . Obviously , small bump stand set . Using home , I 've gotten away touching stand recording careful , obviously unit far ideal . Since , I 've gotten another sidemount boom brand , though I n't really put paces yet , unit rock solid far adjustable reliable , AND costs bucks ( On Stage MSA9508 Posi-Lok Sidemount Boom ) . For anyone considering product , I HIGHLY recommend bypassing one forking bucks On Stage MSA9508 Posi-Lok Sidemount Boom . You far far !

779	I 'm fanatic frets looking shiny polished . I want slick I bend notes . If polish hard often steel wool , wear frets . These micro abrasive sheets great job without harming frets . I watched Youtube demo sold ordering . I think Amazon best price . My frets completely whited using one sheets . I recommend using togheter metal cleaner return frets original factory bright . Incredible ! I opened package first time n't think much , cloth works great cleaning frets even cardboard template job . Obviously , cardboard n't going last purchase metal templates use cloths . The sheets seem work fine polish frets template cut cardboard box obviously n't going last long . Also , trying hold cardboard neck pain finger 'm going go buy fret done . Will replace pro fret job ? Nah ... That said works great use times year clean frets make shiny smooth.End results [ ... ] 
780	So , people review superb , noise best thing ever . To honest , I idea coming . I get good amount noise ( static buzz ) makes difficult use playing guitar quiet mode . Also , sustain good I thought would I lot fine-tuning amp find satisfying setting ( works best additional reverb setting ) said , price , pretty good . I understand folks upset plastic . It , rather inexpensive compressor pretty good job price . In case wondering , clone Boss compressor/sustainer . It good job reproducing original fraction cost . You add noise chain compressor 's do- quiet signal minimize volume spikes even . When , thing pretty decent bypass I would string entire board together pedals true bypass would suck tone . The box plastic , solid ABS plastic perfectly adequate . I 've yet heard Behringer stomp box failing plastic box crushed someone stepped . People like complain battery cover annoying I say- n't ? ? ? hook daisy chain ever deal dead battery ever life , complaining ? The knobs solid , work fine . I like dozen cheap Behringer pedals I never problem . You get asking price worth function box . I bought pedal mainly compressing bass guitar home studio . It supposed . I 'm master compression , I get usable , controlled signal . I noticed hum I turned level pretty high expected . I paid less $ 30 pedal factor 're considering durability bass player uses pedal going SVT classic . No noticeable hum & # 34 ; concert & # 34 ; , pedal made high strength plastic . If angry stomper , go elsewhere . This pedal survive changing ... Yes , 's pain butt . Two pens required push hinge pins release battery cover ( footswitch , ) . I bought power supply , never looked budget , NOT one lucky ones endorsement deal boutique pedal co. , This well . This Behringer compressor sustainer compare 's Boss behringer sustaining excellent tone , compression level good $ 25.00 , putting Boss , price ca n't go wrong . This clone boss compressor works well far I able tell original . owner I would say 're stuck brands I would go like boss cs3 many people say compressor good I know compressors seem little natural sounding however preference needs chicken picking sound plastic nothing unbreakable use sense n't hit hammer 'll break I 've problems behringer heard great things . The cost low anyhow cares anyhow . The title says . Great performance , sub par construction . I bought pedal compression sustain , though , pleased . I use bass guitar , processes signals well . I sure would work well instruments recordings also . Cheaply made , though . I removed spring seemingly attached nothing inside unit . The removal stopped terrible clicking noise would audible stage floor . Plastic means unit likely suffer noticeable wear tear throughout lifetime . Wish better made . Audio reproduction great ! More likely known guitar compensation device , effect widely used everything . I couple behringer pedals , complain plastic housings ) I n't beat gear b ) plastic n't get rust corrosion . The build behringer tough fine , prices make attainable players . The thing I say negative battery junk inherent pedals , got ta spring power supply plug , , eventually 'll drive inherent quack pop country stuff ca n't 's thing . The sustainer adds sustain guitar regardless build , even cheap one ring like got one , tailoring add life even dull axe . Some put effects whatever reason one likely adds tones ca n't without find em . I 've trying get specific sound quite . This pedal completed task . It 's hard describe sound pedal provides perfect . Very punchy crisp . You ca n't go wrong Behringer pedals . They plastic though , might hold heavy road use , home studios perfect . Highly recommended . Noisy compressor using I n't wan na go back one setup . There 's much said pedal : works . It 's fourth cheapy Behringer pedal I pleased every one . This pedal great tweaking sound get right . I play punk , blues , country , pedal helps obtain entire range sounds necessary various styles . Even cheap amp ( upgrading Marshall next month ) , gets job done . People complain plastic casing looking whine , imo . It 's good solid plastic holds well , drops price $ 20 instead $ 50 , makes Behringer effects accessible brand . Behringer pedals value leader effects pedals . I four latest compressor sustainer . It low noise perfect acoustic guitar bass leading music church setting . I 've expensive pedals last 25 years playing , 's hard beat price features quality Behringer pedals . A bargain offered price . Gives virtually unlimited sustain . It good cheap addition effects board . What ask roughly $ 25.00 . This useful guitar compressor . It simple compressor , 's . Easy understand responsive use compressors quite lot . In PA rack I Yamaha rack compressor Alesis rack compressor . In home studio compressors 24 track DAW computer I Deluxe mastering software several VST classic analog compressors like well VST optical compressors . I mention way saying I familiar compressors adept using . I pretty thorough understanding compression ratios , attack release points I learned use sparringly care . The Behringer CS400 good job straight guitar compressor . It usefull taming levels guitar boosting signal adds punch signal presented effects ultimately amp . In recording circles often hear good engineers say hear compressor working , 's used correctly . The Behringer CS400 quiet , almost transparent ( unlike Behringer DC9 I discuss ) . Yes , plastic 's fairly well made unless really rough equipment little care last years . If putting pedal board last long time.If money concern go ahead spend rugged pedal made metal expect pay somewhere around $ $ 100.00 ( Keeley , MXR , Digitech , etc . ) Unless go $ 100.00 I n't think difference performance even subtle . If signal path hum static , pedal change actually may increase 's compressors high signals bring lower signals uniform sound . If want smooth peaks tighten sound punch , little Behringer CS400 . ( Behringer also makes another compressor pedal price range Behringer DC9 . It metal attempts clone classic MXR pedal . I personally would stay away pedal live use . I bought one found although gives great sustain also colors tone seems attenuate low end quite bit higher ratios need long sustain . You dial low end amp expect turn compressor different songs hear tone difference . I n't use DC9 I play live I like guitar I record using VOX VT30 amp . I like better built compressor VT30 ) . I initially wary cost relatively low compared pedals however I set plugged I truly amazed . I know I missing years one . Behringer makes LOT electronics guitar bass . I I use like , great controller price . The CS400 roughly 20.00 decent pedal job done ' . Is equivalent Boss , Dynacomp , Visual Sound Keeley compressor ... nope . You get 20.00 worth use though sure . The housing pretty flimsey change battery PITA . Just n't take flying leap stomp battery consumption really low lot use may change battery twice year . Good pedal beginner unbeatable price point . Behringer products good semi-pro.Nothing fancy compression ; amp good compression lack true sustain low good getting extra boost carry notes n't sound good playing fast.The CS400 shines longest lasting sustain get $ 25 pedal . While case made plastic , construction solid seems durable . My disappointment sound . I never could dial sound made feel like enhanced sound bass . It different . I 've switched using built-in compressor Digitech instead . nice like really wow ! know ? like awesome really cool like like love 
781	For price , I got little expected . The sound pretty great . The scoop switch gives slightly different sound . Other change amount distortion . Its cheap , maybe n't alot fancy versatility settings whatnot . But price one hell deal ! Quality complaints ; little sometimes accidentally moving cable flip around something . But thats expected , big deal 're careful . Now one issue I really pedal , cosmetic worth review ; get . The knobs . They cool chrome ones pictures . They black plastic ones . They look sorta bland cool , ive noticed functionality problems yet . Still great product though . To honest I 'm metal guitarist I love metal music far playing goes I love bluesy solos lots distortion . I decided get pedal electro harmonix , one best names business . And fact cheaper . I 'm VERY pleased pedal could n't happier . I 3 versions pedal cherish one . This one favorite , turn go . I think 's better Sovereign . Since , right , review product amazon.com , I 'll try answer questions might EHX Pocket Metal Muff Pedal . This pedal model simplicity ; volume control , distortion control , switch changes amount ( lack thereof ) mid-scoop . That 's n't leave much room tone tweaking , `` tweakers '' beware ! That said , Electro-Harmonix job pre-setting useable treble bass tone levels require minor tweaking amp 's eq get right want . Playing Fender amp , I immediately shocked good pedal sounded . The bass powerful chunky , great heavy metal palm-muting riffs ; treble good bite n't harsh ; three midrange modes sounded great , depending application : Want flat midrange punchy tone ? Just leave flat setting . Want slightly scooped midrange tone good all-round metal tone ? Move switch low mid-scoop mode . Do want play Master Puppets Metallica ? The high mid-scoop mode calling name . This pedal offers quite bit distortion , I amazed find even higher distortion levels , tone remained clear defined . It n't turn , fuzzy mess like distortion pedals *cough* metal zone *cough* . I mention pedal n't best 're looking modern metal tone . You wo n't get slightly fizzy , ultra-gain ( think Slipknot ) sound pedal . Rather offers crunchy , defined roar characteristic pre-dual rectifier mesa boogie conclusion , I give pedal 5 stars designed well ; version metal muff line n't designed highly versatile `` tweakable '' ; get metal muff top boost pedal want 3-band eq boost function . This pedal designed simple , small box pure classic metal tone , 's exactly accomplishes . Within three seconds using Electro-Harmonix Pocket Metal Muff Pedal , I knew winner . It delivers thermonuclear distortion ultra-easy use . Although n't tone dial , n't need one . And I say trying small tube amp ( 15w ) , small digital amp ( ) , guitar humbuckers , guitar single-coil pickups . The closest tone dial scoop switch on/off switch . As name suggests , allows one choose much mid tones `` scooped . '' It three settings ( scoop scoop ) , sound great . Fans sustain love box , delivers seemingly sustain . The pedal extremely small , would regard plus . I bought watching professional-looking YouTube demonstration . It lived expectations . If I lost box , I 'd immediately order another one . I zero regrets . 
782	For price , 's worth I guess . If want try , go , 's I got . It sounds nice adds cool tone setup , playing expensive chorus pedals I would suggest saving really need chorus pedal . But price 's , casing n't like wimpy plastic knife plastic . 's pretty durable . n't throw concrete expect great results could stand stomps . I mean paid 15 $ pedal want buy BOSS 's price want behringer 's twice price . It supposed n't cheap look . For home garage entertainment good enough . I trying pedal buy pedal brand , know like 'm going buy distortion ( red ) one . 'm sad n't make noise gate something similar . That would top deal . The Chorus subtle ... seems lacking . It subtle really weak compared classic rich ibanez chorus . effect self fine , noisy even though u n't dime , price , product , u get u pay . This puppy sounds fantastic . The controls allow effect adjusted faint top Chorus deep intense sound . The controls front , in/out plugs , little tight adjusting knobs . Very reasonable pricing . Uses 9V battery 9V adaptor . It retro look old school sound , perfect . fast delivery , works perfectly ... I 3 Danelectro effects pedals ... hard say I prefer cause individual distinct sound ... I 'm partial chorus ... good item It 's plastic 's 1 star , case , pleased overall . The effect n't take another planet sound set middle 12 o'clock pedal awesome , really combinations excellent . Check YouTube 's plenty , great price pedal . How many times I tweak chorus pedal hours end decided I n't need chorus . This pedal like , much tweak chorus great . cleans , makes blues sound fattens power chords . I even like bass . Just great chorus much tweak . The Danelectro FAB series pedals offer great sound without digging budget . The Chorus effects pedal works great gives soft phase shift would expect expensive unit ... This series pedals ( FAB ) hard plastic cases less expensive hardware costly units works quit well . Danelectro offers expensive units I n't think sound much better , hardware better , 's view ! ! ! . You ca n't go wrong product , Danelectro around years makes great product ... I six Danelectro effects pedals work great ... Yes , pedal made plastic . Yes inexpensive . But n't unless really switch button like idiot , torque battery cover screw hard screw driver strip plastic threads- pretty tough durable . The chorus effect plenty adjustment , tone , depth . It may Boss pedal , $ getting tremendous value sounds good . I impressed inexpensive pedals I 4 5 . As hobbyist guitar player want invest hundreds dollars multiple effects pedals- I 4 5 PLUS associated cables power adapter amount I could buy ONE Boss high quality pedal for.I would also recommend buying Danelectrode 9V power adapter use multiple pedals . You also buy 5 power cable daisy chain 4 5 pedals power supply make pedal board . If multiple Danelectro pedals clean way tie together . I also bought short 6 inch instrument cables daisy chained pedal together I mixed effects , one pedals used almost daily couple months I one issue date . A guitar player friends tried mine also impressed . Absolutely 5 star value ! Got little guy last night use Squier Tele Custom II , hooked played around really impressed quality effect get nearly pocket change ! I also Digitech RP-50 multiple effects including different types chorus Fab Chorus sounds better RP-50 's chorus settings . I looking forward laying cool tracks using Tele , Applause acoustic/electric , Squier Vintage Modified 70 's bass guitar . And like folks 've bought product , I 'll likely getting Danelectro 's Fab boxes Dan Electrode power supply . The Danelectro FAB series supposed everything hate effects pedals . Cheap . . plastic casing . But FAB series offers affordable effects ( $ 15 $ 20 ) surprisingly good quality , end sounding good pedals cost 3 times . If pedal cost $ 50 , I might gripe tight together jacks . I might also complain weird position Mix , Speed , Depth controls top unit , small footswitch . But price , sound THIS good , I ca n't complain n't expect FAB series good everything . But 's effect use awhile ( especially anything involving modulation delay ) , FAB series going well , fraction cost pedals . It 's great option guitarists . Gives nice warped slightly detuned effect first right settings . ( Think Alice chains , REALLY distorted live solo ) admittedly everyone 's whole grunge tone . But I looking nice shimmers thickening settings too.And hey , pretty much get pocket change . I yet find pedal match little guys desired effect ... ... If know use , really delivers good effect . sound pretty good .. mean , range arent broad others 've tried ..but stomp regularly.. cuts signal bit .. compensate , always leave bit extra volume bank make up..all . 
783	Folks like original Ibanez Tube King love pedal . construction 's pedals- The housing metal knobs seem bit solid . Folks talk bad stock tube , experience . I may experement low gain JJ future , stock tube staying put . Maybe I got lucky selected ' right one ? This unit sounds really incredible 's running front end EL84 powered tube amp . The sound really organic gritty , great harmonics smooth sustain . Sounds decent nearly good going solid state amp ( suprise ) . Still , improvement sterile solid state tone . Be forewarned - pedal dimension . Who cares , long sounds good ? ? I 'd wanted vintage Tube Driver forever , I honestly n't need one . This pedal gets cheap ! The VT999 Vintage Tube Monster quite quickly become go-to overdrive pedal , surpassing OD pedals I 've used , including Digitech Bad Monkey , Ibanez TS9 Tubescreamer , Boss SD-1 Super Overdrive , remarkably , Fulltone Fulldrive 2 VT999 several things going -- - EQ ( ) allows run full spectrum , muddy , dirty low OD sounds , even single coil , bright , screaming lead tones high mids Noise gate eliminate single coil hum also used `` squeeze '' tone interesting Wide range gain gets dirty around 9 o'clock full-on distortion , full disclosure sake , I change tube JJ Tesla 12AX7 , people know tubes tell really , tubes often hit-or-miss , simply account analog , elements . That 's part fun tube-based OD . I played VT999 great sounding overdrive , mine n't sound I put new tube . Try stock tube , go different tube n't like . At least try new tube giving up.There two things I n't like VT999 , I tell -- gripes nothing sound tone . This pedal got 100 % right tone tube switch . The 2 issues : - The housing huge , look inside , seems like waste space . There 's lot open space nothing , I concede tubes heat need space heat , 's bit Compared Fulldrive , lack boost switch really miss . Especially given large enclosure , would make perfect sense move 5 knobs top half pedal put boost switch right hand side . That 'd take little effort , given independent power pedal , would piece cake achieve . Heck , I could probably , I n't want ruin good sound produces.Bottom line , I understand pedalboard , real estate everything . This takes least space 2 pedals . Is worth ? To , . I run 2 OD pedals board , I honestly say , last 10 gigs , I never gone OD . It 's Vintage Tube Monster every time . BOTTOM LINE UP FRONT : The Behringer VT999 Vintage Tube Monster indeed monster pedal . Those seeking hot rodded sound amp would wise check product , level boost gain stock 12AX7 enough push tube amp 's clean channel saturated 3-band EQ ranges barely noticeable perhaps & # 34 ; much & # 34 ; , I surprised I actually found backing knobs I expected cheap pedal needed 's EQ pushed max order get playable tone . I wrong . The Master Gain knobs work exactly like tube amp channel . The Noise Suppressor nifty feature drastically reduces white taking space 3 standard pedals pedalboard , many probably wonder 's even worth real estate compared overdrives . However , comes tube-based pedals , big par stock tube decent point get musical tones pedal . I personally n't plan changing stock tube time soon I want test limits , gain range effectively Boss OD-1 DS-1 , YES - possible get metal tones pedal , especially late 90s metal tones.I honestly ca n't say anything bad wrong pedal . I judge gear EARS VALUE , PRICE , honestly ... $ 50 , literally ca n't go wrong . There worse pedals could buy money quite honestly . Even $ 10- $ 15 mod change tube something preference , 're still looking relatively inexpensive pedal amazing value . But 're looking tube overdrives , check : Tube Drive ( $ 350 ) , Maxon True Tube ( $ ) , Ibanez Tube King ( $ 170 ) .If 're fence thing , go ahead jump get one . With trials using different tubes pedal add something tough get otherwise . I run guitar direct I n't like amps cart things around . There many shades tone available 's tough really praise gadget enough especially considering low cost . I also found using compresser helps . I 's Tone & made big . I highly reccomend tube pre-amp & encourage trying different tubes get sound want . It sounds good . Not professional tube driver , quite well price . Perfect intermediate players ca n't afford something else little bit expensive . This thing amazing . Like many I afford tube amp . This transforms solid state amps something comparable tube amps I played years ago . Sustain harmonics insane . Preamp precise allows nice variety tones.The unit heavy rugged . The component I would concerned time battery adapter replaceable low cost . I Blue Voodoo tube amp . It 's great tone . Sadly , I tried revamping new tubes , though gave drive I needed , also raised noise level tremendously . This last resource selling amp I want part . I thought pedal would trick . I right . You would think one tube would get much drive , puppy gives expected . Behringer used known junk , .

785	This unit well knobs feel sturdy.The user guide wide tone range . I usually play Hofner club bass sounds deep useful want dial good sound leave set . It n't presets . You loop effects processor thru . I play bass lot different environments , I never know expect I show . If I playing venue I use head 4x12 combo I know I 'll great tone . If I going direct board I house equipment engineer . This unit gives ; ability still go direct , allows tweak signal maximum warmth . I suppose could look like effects stomp box really much . play church tired hearing life sucked bass give try . I love . DI bass worst . Just really , really awful . Every ordinary DI box I 've tried yields thin , cheap treble sound present bass flattering light . So I started playing live weekly , I bass amp around gig , question I would rely weird sounding DI box carry day.I live . I made two months lugging monstrous bass amp across town 115 degree weather I decided another way.When I first got pedal , I would run parallel amp , terrified rely entirely little box sound . After performances , I let go left amp home . The Bass Attack pedal disappoint . Ever since , I bring bass pedal . Running straight board thing delivers huge bass sound . I n't miss amp all.I spend entire evening night pedal arrived , tweaking knobs perfect . You 'll want dial exactly right sound bass , settings I tried less ideal instrument . But I got locked , I 've never touched knobs . I plug everything sounds magical . I rated 5 stars 5 stars means & # 34 ; I Love & # 34 ; Amazon 's selection things . I love . In fact I think better Sans Amp Bass DI costs . Do n't get wrong , Sans Amp still great . I find easier dial , durable seems bit lively sounding previously mentioned preamp . The side n't come AC power adapter . That n't problem since I many power options pedal boards . This takes standard negative polarity center like Boss playing bass , know matter good bass rig , make better putting decent tone shaping booster front amp ... said ... ... ... ... I 50s I play mostly guitar music like Robin Trower , SRV , Hendrix , Yes , Rush , lots blues southern rock etc etc ... ... ... ... . fun old rock n roll stuff.Like Sans Amp , putting front bass amp makes bass sound better . You easily get live Chris Squier Geddy Lee sound . The older style full deep bass bluesy rock sound simple . The tone I love dial old 3 piece rock band sound years past . Think Mel Grand Funk old James Joe Days , Johnny winter , Cream ... ... .. driven cranked Ampeg Fender tube bass amp sound filled exceptionally well 3 piece power band.I running Ampeg Bass combo I run directly front house sound system sound fabulous . Playing bass side gig since I mainly lead guitarist ... ... .. I let bassist try ( also uses Sans Amp Bass DI gigs ) immediately went online purchased another cool use pedal . If guitarist , put front guitar amp . The punch power add sound incredible . Try . This thing sounds great ! I run two outputs DAW ( Reaper ) , I direct DI reamping regular tone Hartke 's preamp overall bass tone . The general sound warm plenty low end , `` Shape '' control pretty cool adding little bit layering . It 's easy reamp , layering unshaped Hartke tone + another track shaped `` gritty '' tone get seriously solid sounding bass tones mix - especially higher gain metal playing.Awesome unit price , happy . I 'm using DI box recording . It compression , overdrive , EQ'ing , notch EQ'ing , one pedal . So compared original bass signal , get clear , deep , punchy sound fits right Bass Attack sounds lot like SansAmp Bass Driver 1/3 price . One difference additional `` Shape '' knob , lot like knob Blackstar products , notch filter . The difference SansAmp uses tougher chassis components , would last longer gigging musician . But n't take wrong , Bass Attack uses solid metal chassis n't feel cheap all.The Harmonics knob adds overdrive , gets kind farty turned 100 % sounds pretty good % . It n't high gain super distortion though , could connect distortion pedal parallel output , duplicate track DAW add distortion plugin.This pedal versatile . I found Shape knob indispensable ; takes place mid control . For example , ( reducing ) boomy Hz region turning level , get plenty mids . The treble bright control seem similar , one seems amplify region , 5k 's estimate . By keeping around 10 o'clock Shape control beneath 115 Hz , I get solid , deep , yet sound metal mix . Thus anyone thinks pedal bass treble mids , ought try settings along good feature pedal run 48V phantom power . As , adapter battery needed recording direct running mixer . In conclusion , recording , duplicate SansAmp sound hear lot albums using Bass Attack , tweak via Shape control . And yes , various button pushes get four different sounds total , I prefer buttons . Then DAW I throw extra compressor sounds great . This pedal steal frills bass DI recording . 
786	I 'm happy . Used replace blown speaker 30 yr. old 60W Roland Cube Amp ( bass player used amp I think much speaker -- next time I 'll use PA bass player ) . Much better sound , perfect fit , etc . Keep mind clean sound speaker recommended clean somewhat smokey-type sound . I believe . Using jazz applications Roland around second amp . Replaced stock fender speaker modified Mustang Lead II cabinet I use connected Hughes Kettner amp . This speaker dramatically improved sound cabinet , sounded good using Mustang II amp well . This speaker seems take sizzle shrill high-end make nice even sound . I 'm quite pleased speaker . I built custom cabinet installed baby . Boy crank . I 've tried couple different heads sound great . I play mostly clean speaker makes tube tones shine . This speaker clear full range sound . I '63 Brown Deluxe good . .In way reminds bit JBL smooth depth clarity . If I want little Ray Charles raspcan get amp speaker pick attack . Cool speaker nice addition . Against educated experienced advice many blogs I installed one Twin Reverb 100 watt . The original speakers sounding me.They hurt ears , clean . This speaker range little bonus sizzle boot , round , full , musical way . Again may like tread ill advised path , 50 watt speakers , Twin Reverb 100 watts . Right I CR one original speaker running TR . I 'll get another CR one holds okay . But I 'm band plays small rooms lot I dont crank past 4-5 often . I 'll post update speaker fails . But least initial run , I 'm glad I bought And Roll Forever ! The Eminence Patriot Cannabis Rex probably smoothest sounding guitar speaker I 've ever heard . mean 's dull sounding muffled least , hearing still good . I hesitated quite bit I decided buy install Fender Mustang II worries . Incredibly , tamed highs without losing shimmer clarity clean sounds . Yet , overdrive sounds , little - big full FAT sound 's articulate without buzzy . If play metal 'll probably hate speaker like bluesy , classic rock jazzy sounds , speaker seriously consider . I turned Mustang II open back combo Cannabis Rex gave amp low end extension needed . I turn treble control bit unlike amps , never got shrill piercing , buttery smooth clear . It 's also much efficient stock speaker @ n't know Eminence I love ! To , stock 12 '' speaker came Fender Blues Deluxe Reissue sounded brittle . Even I messed presence EQ knobs always accentuated highs much . I read reviews speaker decided pull trigger get one . I n't regretted purchase.I hoping improvement would I put 10 '' Ragin Fender Super Champ XD . Was n't case . It DID , however , fix problem I purchased speaker . My Blues Deluxe sounds warmer n't accentuated high-end . All good upgrade I 'd

If dead sounding ukulele , sometimes heard laminate ukes , want added volume , Aquila strings second none .

Fantastic sound -- trust everyone saying -- buy strings slap em cheap ukulele , bought hundreds hours playing fun ! 
789	I bought guitar nearly year ago . It first guitar . I never cared much sound . It always sounded tune , even tune . I eventually bought acoustic guitar learn play happier Squier . My skills slowly improving I wanted another electric I sprang Epiphone Les Paul . Yes , 's 3x expensive Squier BulletStrat - sounds 10x buy Squier , I think need prepared make `` project '' guitar . You 'll probably want replace tuners , pickups , bridge , buy better guitar begin . At price point probably wo n't find much better probably want spend little much better guitar . Had two weeks I 'm return I like ( ) :1 . It 's classic Fender I looking something good quality great price.2 . Sounds clear crystal good , unplugged.3 . This subjective I think BulletStrat comfortable Les Paul simply 's wider thinner.4 . All previous four ratings Amazon even higher ratings Musician 's I n't like . 15th fret lower E string dead , like always I take quality control rating account . ( I n't want bother go local shop fix , never mention 's $ 20 addition ) 2 . I could n't figure tune nob never changed sound ( like bit ) ? ( I 'm new electric Les Paul change tunes ... much much obvious way ) 3 . plugged sound , 's close unplugged . Notes pretty mixed separated/clear , loud though.4 . I n't know 's universal , I ordered new get dirty plastic cover scratches . What 's worse , place nasty cover panel components upon makes impossible remove ... ( I ' , even sure I call protective cover 's pretty weak thin . ) This overall OK guitar , consider price made least slightly better . For beginners budget less $ 200 , I would recommend go better ones little price . For example , , I got SX ( $ 175 ) Les Paul I 'm love . Simply everything better , I finally get feelings electric . I 'm glad I n't need stuck Stars - It 's Stars - I like Stars - I love it3 Stars Checked , really IS guitar reading , hope people find beloved guitars ! I love & # 34 ; pinkie & # 34 ; ! I taking lessons using electric acoustic guitar I wanted see difference . This thinner neck n't stretch wide , 's easier hands . It 's actually fairly light electric guitar I went 's Fender seem Fender quality price . The thing I n't like slight buzzy sound 6th string . I know better I take originals , n't major issue . With exception classical , Fender upped quality every low-end guitar 's associated . The latest & # 34 ; bargain basement & # 34 ; Squier Strat Bullet exception . As reviewers indicated , Squier Bullet ... straight box ... ready give guitars several times street value full-on competition . But stop ? If 've read reviews , know I 'm serial . And THIS favorite ' . Why ? Because 's sound platform begin ( pun intended ) .The basic stuff Bullet good ... many , 's 's required . But let 's quest serious , sound . The first things upgrade pickups . The standard Squier pickups yeoman 's work , 're wonderfully top-drawer pickups Lace Seymour Duncan . My favorites ? A Lace Red bridge single Lace Hot Gold parked half-way middle neck positions . The Lace Hot Gold value pack Hot Gold Hot bridge pickup . And Lace ' Red , Silver , Blue value pack . You simply hear difference pickups make believe ... need find Phillips screwdriver , cheap soldering iron , solder , pair wire-cutters , option YouTube ' videos , wait minute , hold phone ... stock pick guard ? Please : Chandler Guitar 's Pickguard Heaven . Better yet , Google . They 're wonderful folks work . With custom pick guard , virtually ANYTHING possible ( e.g . Seymour Duncan bridge ? ) ! The next thing block tremolo ( whammy ) mechanism . Proper vibrato comes fingers . Period . A small piece Home Depot , carefully whittled ( guitar 's sake , finger 's ) easily wedged guitar body die-cast tremolo string-carrier removing ( eventually replacing ) six Phillips screws back Strat . Hey , 're Eric want sound , stock plastic nut replaced brass Strat nut , bit careful filing , tiny touch epoxy Gorilla glue . Why bother ? A forward lead guitar sound . If play rhythm , n't , 're monster precise tuning basic woodworking skills , good stock tuners replaced state-of-the-art six-inline tuners several manufacturers . Note well : folks well served stock tuners.So 's point ? For price one genuine American Strat ( VERY nice ride afford ) three four , Squier Bullets diverse mix pickups resulting sounds . My first Guitar , I 'm 60 years old , Guitar better ones , I ca n't wait get one..I 've got one small 15 watt Amp , 's name , sounds , needless say I 'm verrrrrrry happy , love blues Jazz sounds I 'm T W ... Who said learning guitar , u practice..Buy Guitar , u wo n't sorry The Squier Bullet I actually model without tremolo , however , everything else model see . It 's nice guitar money . Nice size , action , finish . It 's high-end guitar n't expect sound like one , beginner , 's pretty sweet . I bought expensive blues guitar planned trading one selling , however , I like much , I plan keeping back . pretty easy come ( slight modifications , 's expected ) fairly cheap . Great beginner new strings everything else smooth.Pick set slinky strings well . It feels great , looks great , sounds great . What I say ? If 're starting , guitar perfect . Once get better playing , customize bit level skill . Highly recommended . This guitar got stolen ! ! ! thieves , I loved guitar moment hands , super light , unlike gretsch guitar , easy take anywhere , handle rough playing , simply awesome , specially costs ! I getting another one : D Ok price . Tuners old style sealed . PUP plate quite bit . I 'd suggest adding locking tuners least modern day versions.On positive , action intonation good . Better expected . Much better Chinese guitars price level . However , I 've purchased others higher quality hardware less . That said , 'll probably setup overall quality better Squier . Many years ago I Fender Stratocaster I get rid , I closest I ever get guitar . This one sounds great looks good , price great well . I initially wanted Yamaha - Guitar Center claimed stock website - I reached - n't . So I tested Affinity Bullet HSS instead - thought Bullet pretty ok - color I wanted . So I ordered Amazon - I bought Guitar Center I 'm greatful opportunity test guitars.I waited 2 weeks I make review would accurate based initial received guitar perfect condition - came brown box shipping pictures nice colors . Just words SQUIER Fender . New strings scratch free . Made China says . However - sharp frets like I experience 100 bucks action came high I intended return - guitar perfect I could n't find fault return . So I proceed setup guitar 3 long painful steps : 1 ) neck adjusting truss rod . 2 ) Then measured string action height set first 3 strings 2mm last 3 strings . 3 ) Setup intonation using tuner . You really need tuner step.After , guitar splendid . It go tune 2 3 days stabilized . I use trem bar fear losing tuning.After 2 weeks , I 'm still loving guitar . Beginners warned - may like action may need setup like I . In fact I 'm impressed Squier I 'm thinking getting Squier Standard Strat next - pretty curious Alnico pups.Latest review : 5 3 stars.I bought Washburn Duncan bullet nice I it.The tuners hard tune sensitive.The bullet little sustain unless want experiment changing strings , Tusq nut , locking trem etc.I 'd recommend save money buy something $ 200 . Guitars price may twice cost , .. twice better.The 2 important things Bullet : sustain sound.Latest review : The product back 5 stars ! I got sustain improve increasing buzz causes sustain cut short.There sounds Strat humbuckers type guitar fall short ... like attack finger plucking . 
790	even though ordered large ... still fitting ... little homework try get reemed little fit ... giant hands large fit ... ... well made ... heavy thats looking ... arrived time..but ... good luck This high quality Slide really serves purpose well . Try one ... ... ... ... ... I think love , 's 're looking . After experiencing frustration tone differences difference amount noise steel bar ( lap playing ) Dunlop 210 glass slide ( `` Spanish style '' playing ) , I decided try Dunlop tapered brass slide . It 's probably personal issue , I much prefer weight brass slide . The taper seems cover stings resonator guitar consistently straight glass slide . The sustain better string noise easier control . This slide also seems well made nice shine . The material fact fits better glass slide significant pluses . Another practical plus brass slide I n't worry would happen I drop . In short : 's winner . I never use slide play guitar , first I ever , look like good quality , I learn play ; - ) When say small , mean small . I order large get comfortably ring finger , hands large anyone 's standards.Find slide Large , I wrote complimentary review . 
791	I agree reviewers really like pickup . It natural sound , reliable amazingly strong . The suction cup issue easy solve , needs bit humid stay well . I also bought ( comparison ) Cherub WCP-60G , bad much unnatural metallic sound , plus seems AXL . I recommend , nice classical guitar want amplify true sound , AXL excellent inexpensive solution . I doubt $ 200 stuff much better . Got right b4 x'mas , thanks Amazon ! It one best value I purchased . design great size string instruments , uke , small soundholded guitars , acoustic guitars . Thanks previous viewers ' tip moisture suction b4 pressuring surface guitar next bridge . It stays great pickups perfectly without unwanted noise pickup wire ( recently bought another one ) . great value quality $ 11 spent ever . I bought friend plays guitar . He said hear guitar barely . It stick guitar well . Trying reviews ways get stick worked I small circle finish Martin . I made mistake attaching wife could play Rocksmith wish I used cheaper guitar better yet , bought better pickup . Works really well stringed acoustic instruments It good clean sound I think price go wrong . suction cup work . looks like aged . 's hard room temp . I removed rubber suction cup I use big paper clipper secure sound hole edge . picks sound OK , great .

793	Use time . Has velcro . Goes DI preamp audio interface . Good quality . Like title says , gets job done , well built . Do n't waste money spending premium brands like monster cable get instead . I challenge anyone blind test say tell difference . Nice cables price . Nice good name , useful band 's mixer rack setup . awesome cord hope make world better place , peace love ! ! ! ! ! ! ! My Instant Order Update notice shows I purchased December 3 , 2010 , time I 've owned cable heavily used still noise-free perfect respects . For context I purchased connect mic tube pre-amp mixer , set torn many times past two half years.Key points earn five stars heavy duty strain reliefs , keep inside conductors bending stressing . I guessing patch continues noise free provide strong signal . Also , XLR connectors highest quality . In past I cut corners find small details like connectors always mate well . Not . They engage disengage without binding . Bear mind frequent use - inserted removed hundreds times.The outer jacket fairly thick , indication manufacturer cut corners cable I pleased patch withstood lot use held perfectly . I would hesitate purchase brand model I need additional ones . The plastic piece screws wire end made VERY thin plastic , cracked two within week light use . I guess I redo electrical tape make work , I many Whirlwind cables lasted 15+ years . I expected manufacturer , I guess quality used . I bought & # 34 ; daisy-chain & # 34 ; two small Kustom powered PA cabinets . Virtually XLR cables available way long application . This cable filled bill perfectly . I buy many cable test correctly meter work great . So far I n't issues . They feel well made I continue use bands PA . This great xlr cable job I need , attach shoe external shotgun mic . It low noise , clean sound/good transmission . The issue particular cable , ones , hard get locking click anything attaches either end . Once 's attached 's fine , 's coming , I pull much harder cables makes worried I 'll damage microphone . With expensive equipment , I 'd use different cable tight grip male female sides worries .

795	This first tube amp TON research , I found VOX AC15C1 perfect me.It came AC15 , Fender Blues Jr. Ibanez . The Blues Jr. somewhat small enclosure 1x12 I felt bit `` boxy '' tone , otherwise , 's great amp . The Ibanez classic Tube Screamer circuit built switch cuts wattage half playing lower volumes , lacked reverb circuit , deal breaker ( silly reasoning , I know ) . The AC15 larger enclosure Blues Jr. , reverb AND tremolo circuit , features I looking importantly , produces killer tone.If 've ever seen read review amp , chances , 've heard classic VOX `` chime '' , amp , I fell love natural tube saturation top boost channel right away . The normal channel break nicely , I would suggest A/B switch run normal channel fairly clean top boost pretty worried first 15 watts would n't enough , fear , amp LOUD ... maybe loud I 'm hobbyist plays bedroom , 's bad thing . It totally blows away 100 watt Marshall solid state I n't put volume much past 8 fear wife may beat death I effects loop , takes pedals well , distorted tones , I 've found plugging straight get unadulterated tube crunch , I 've come love much . As stated , lack foot switch change clean dirty tones solved either running dirt box front amp , previously stated , running one channel clean one channel dirty us A/B switch go . As far effects , I really like TC Electronic Flashback Delay Corona Chorus . Note foot switch jack back panel , controls on/off built tremolo reverb , 's sadly included first tube amp , I n't think I could done much better ; I love tone I get , tube warmth sooo much soulful sterile sound solid state amp , 's feature rich , takes pedals well . The two amps I considering little less expensive , I really feel VOX better around amp , I n't think go wrong one three.The weight ( 50 lbs ) , lack included foot switch really two cons I think . While I would picked three amps I looking I means , I would hesitate recommend amp anyone looking first next tube amp . This amazing amp . It works great , lot power , little bit heavy 's size simply beauty . I play godin ultra The sound amp clean play acoustic electric trough amp sounds perfect . Even acoustic sound . amp adapts need , cleanest sound heaviest distorted sound . I 've 3 years I agree every one fantastic amp good price point . It 's wonderful sounding amp gives good chimey cleans lush distorted breakup . It gets better speaker breaks make sure put lots hours initially rewarded . If Blues Jr. similarly powered priced I 'd opt second . I think AC15C1 actually better blues amp . ( vary course ) I couple `` wishes '' 're really gripes . One stock reverb . It 's really overboard way I n't find musical . I ordered new tank 's great . I hope Vox changed I found anything 2 stock tank way much . Second would FX loop . Not deal breaker amp takes pedals well would good feature wold channel switching built . Third last I wish came footswitch turn Trem on/off switch top boost normal channels . I know get aftermarket would nice . Probably one reasons 's speaking foot switches favor get switch . It allows switch top channels also allows run channels time let tell really sweet tones run channels . I 've gone fair amount gear time n't see getting rid . It 's fun little amp 's nice around even main go-to amp . It 's certainly loud enough small venues jamming controlled drummer 's going shake paint walls like AC30 . Highly recommended . At $ 600 price point tube amp PLUS reverb tremelo ( well , two pedals I wo n't buy ) insane . It REALLY loud , anything jangly pop Pink Floyd hard rock ( high gain modern metal heads , though , might want look ENGL ) . I dialed tone day started blasting 's also hefty beast stand sustained use.The thing drag footswitch , controls reverb tremolo , sold separately ( $ 40 street ) everybody . I managed snag one , involved bit luck . They restocking stores couple weeks . I play band church , I 've wanting Vox AC15 quite time . For play contemporary Christian music wondering heck I 'm talking , let 's say 's unwritten requirement play kind music , must utilize Vox tone . Because U2 . I know sounding weirder second take word , past years I 've utilizing Line 6 Floor POD Plus achieve tone . I 've using `` Class A '' sound , close , quite useable , reason sounds mushy low strings strat I 've never found way around . I sort dealt . Then came Father 's Day year wife surprised used Vox AC15C1 I love everything . Doing little research , seems predecessor ( ) decent certain things sucked mods performed owners . Well , AC15C1 popular mods end amp 's awesome right box . I 've seen people complain fact 's inside , 's made China . So . It sounds nice , especially low price.The amp 's overdrive rich , lots harmonic overtones higher crank master volume . I cranked 10 living room quire loud amp , window-shattering loud . In church setting obviously option . Fortunately , lower master volume amplifier still retains much glassy Vox tone , manageable level . You need purchase optional foot switch toggle `` Top Boost '' `` Normal '' channels . I 've opted use `` Normal '' channel push Joyo Ultimate Drive pedal , way , impressive $ 40 overdrive pedal 'll ever hear . That overdrive interfere Vox tone . I used morning stratocaster loaded DiMarzio series pickups Joyo pedal pushing amp , classic Vox chime way . I also used Boss delay ( also required play Christian band - reason thing I mentioned ... ) Pure tone noted noise `` hiss '' problems amp , usually solved installing better set preamp tubes . Mine problem . Actually , I thought , I certainly getting loud hiss I realized way I amp set : As I stated earlier , amp ( Normal Top Boost ) , one 're using determined input plug guitar . I plugged Normal channel , n't realize Top Boost volume dimed 's hiss coming . I shut volume completely since I using Top Boost channel anyway . Problem solved.I 'm amazed affordable amp sound nice . I 've owned Marshalls , , , Music Man , oddball tube amps years , costing several times cost Vox AC15C1 Vox hold others . Think affordable `` boutique amp '' . If pick one used like I , better . Interestingly enough , amp advertized used Vox AC15 indication whether C1 . Fortunately C1 . It 's value full price also . Get one . 
796	I problems getting brand new poly pro strap . Even snug , would n't hard work strap . I n't know people saying bad things product , If dealing guitars much harder things guitars getting snug leather strap onto locks . Do n't listen whiners . These need . You find `` cheaper '' ones , sometimes Schallers price cheaper . These best design lock opinion hold years abuse use . I 've several sets years use without hesitation . I 5 guitars , acoustic & # 34 ; novelty & # 34 ; guitar exceptions . I ca n't stand thought using seeing many expensive guitars hit floor straps let loose . Other styles button , seems convenient , Schaller locks pull style far secure something bumps end lock . These locks I 'll use . I 'm never playing another guitar without locks ! After Custom Telecaster fell . The neck went wack , I readjust truss rod spend hours setup guitar ! That 's every musician 's nightmare ! I immediately started research proper locking mechanism straps . Schaller kept coming . I looked design confident safe use.One issue may run nut running loose . That 's problem scaller locks , happens anything uses type nuts ( happened guitars input jack ) . A drop glue around threading fix issue easily . These must-have item . , I 've using Planet waves strap straplock mechanism . While 's innovative system n't require installation , plastic ends large bit awkward get way things.I installed Schallers Strat body -- I found I needed add toothpick pieces per recommendations others achieve super tight fit -- big deal . These Schallers exactly I wanted . 5 stars , no-brainer . I got custom les paul 5 string bass I built one locks broke month couple uses . Also locks quite uncomfortable use . I never used strap locks n't think I . I using 2 years ; I happy strap locks . Great product . I bought black locks go black Stratocaster I built . I n't use strap locks Schallers guitars I build . I recently bought Fender locks worked fine large existing straps would n't fit . 
797	I 've bought several pairs guitars complaints yet . They work flawlessly . I 'll definitely buy highly recommend . Just like Schaller Fender branded cheaper ( Asian made ) . Tested guitar mags best strap lock available . These basically Schaller strap locks . They cost less money I think parts interchangeable . It still best keep seperated original manufacturer ( disclaimer . ) I know Fender buttons work Schaller strap portion lock . As new guitar player I lot learn , nearly dropping guitar twice 15 minutes strap sliding pegs research needed . Based reviews sites I ordered . Arrived quickly , extremely easy install work advertised . Would buy if/when I new guitars . Actually 're fender , Schaller , really good ! . Looks great Fender Squier . Highly recommended ! Got vintage instrument n't ever want see hitting floor ... well , long term 100 % secure solution ! They seem original schallers came tele deluxe 2008 bigger stronger lack better word , still good buy Our family 2 guitarists 1 bassist switched style locks year ago . Every one us continual problems locks periodically unscrewing guitar body . I one back gig damage brand new 60th Anniversary American P-Bass ... good . My son one come middle gig last weekend.The problem design 's ton friction top bottom pieces lock results tab 's screwed body unscrewing . We 've tried applying bar soap , petro jelly , spray based dry lubricant ... . none prevented ultimate forces cause phenomenon.We switching Dunlop style locks design incorporates ball bearings allows strap rotate freely back forth next zero 'unscrewing ' force.We tried make work could . Maybe 're active stage tolerate equipment damage performance distruptions caused us . If play lot install guitars straps . Easy use secure . No fear strap coming loose guitar drop floor . There lot think strap lock ... Is 100 % sturdy ? 100 % reliable ? Does design put undue stress wear guitar ? Can fit case , make take strap every time put guitar away ? The design covers bases well . I believe 100 % sturdy reliable . Unlike 's Dunlop competition , stress guitar roughly equivalent plain strap buttons . It fit cases , fit 've switched design could n't happier : I advise using wrench socket tighten nut . One always wants avoid over-tightening , risk under-tightening high without proper leverage . If n't really tighten nut , likely things fall apart playing day . I bought one padded Fender leather straps ( says leather back ) . I thought Fender strap locks would complement strap , padding thread strap-lock n't high enough nut reach . I finally got nut get hold top thread although works I n't trust enough . If padded leather strap I n't recommend . This straplock set n't come instructions , 's 's easy n't need ! Took original screws Fender Strat , set button , screws felt washer together quickly screwed . Afterwards screwed lock Lightning Bolt Style 2 Inch Guitar Strap , Jet problem whatsoever ready ! It quite simple mechanism shows button lock wo n't come loose accident chance . Still n't given real gig test hanging couple minutes I tell I made right purchase . Way recommended ! This good strap lock system . put wolfgang guitar locked properly strap . recommended . This filler item much larger order . I interested Straplocks , I decided give try . I sincerely like concept . Easy install , I used guitars existing strap button screws.Straplocks came black & white felt , 's nice touch . I think black looks better guitar . Look like Schaler branded parts without Schaler brand name stamped - little Fender logo bottom - real strap locks greatest - work perfectly every time survive years road abuse . I carried extra set case event I broke one - never , bar bands , garage bands bedroom heroes need strap locks every guitar strap . And since guitar n't hanging hole strap strap lasts years longer . 
798	Mics like pants , find right fit . This one I like vocals live . I sing fairly low airy - works great . Also used mic resonator guitar tube mic preamp live , sweet sound . I prefer 58 , seems bit bright natural . Might purchase another one eventually ... Why drive drive ? This best mic far I concerned . I Shure SM 58 like everyone else owned comparison mic SM58 . SM 58 garbage compared Beta 58A . Spring extra bucks happy . That 's I always say . I one , well several microphones . The SM58 good around mic - reason 's industry standard/go-to , Beta 58A better ( opinion ) vocal-specific mic ... basically giving ( , opinion ) higher quality sound . The SM58 comparison sounds , Beta58A clearer , stronger , articulate . If 're used SM58 , Beta58A sound thin harsh , , adjustable board - end result 's tighter sounding mic , better rejecting unwanted sounds - I play drums use mic reason , picks less drums SM57 SM58 . Yes , costs considerably SM58 I 'm sure I could pass comparison test two , I love mic ! To , sounds slightly brighter clearer 58s I used past . If musician strapped cash trying make ends meet , get 58 . If extra dough want confidence boost , go Beta . I would buy . I 'm amateur sound tech . We 've using SM58 church years singers/song leaders liked much mics 've . Our singers growing needed mic thought Beta58A good reviews . When I received I wait test whoaaah.. For , sounded better SM58 . My songleaders tested guess ... dont want use SM58 anymore : ) While Shure SM58LC Shure SM58 Vocal Microphone seems running staple live performance vocals , rightly due comparative value amazing quality sound craftsmanship , Beta 58A needs given due . The Beta 58A amazing dynamic microphone might alleviate stress associated cost efficient cousin . That , Beta 58A , confined live scenarios I utilized , demonstrated much broader sweet spot completely eliminated severe feedback issues . For vocalists like pull back mic touch really belt sustained high ( , really , ) notes Beta dream . This effect helps one experiencing sibilance `` popping '' complications needs sing past microphone opposed directly I wish I better understanding sound engineering standpoint technical specifics could upon , I confidently say Beta 58A best vocals microphone I ever utilized aside higher end condenser mics isolated environment . Quite honestly , I would surprised Beta compared well even confined recording situations . The bottom line Beta 58A might expensive popular cousin , SM58 , worth every penny . Anyone opportunity give chance demonstrate superiority . Six five stars ! The Beta 58A along original SM58 industry standards , 's well known . As general purpose workhorse live vocals far popular tools . Quality venues throughout country commonly stock go-to house mics . In fact , I noticed place small theater ( high-end system ) I played recently.I used old 58 years moving Beta certainly noticeable difference two . The Beta hotter , sensitive response . Your vocals cut mix strongly clarity might used . Mids highs picked perfectly singing inches away subtle low frequency roll-off avoid boomy , sound typically get hitting low quiet notes close . You definitely need stay within close range though pickup pattern tight . This good thing extraneous noise feedback effectively rejected . `` Built like tank '' probably bit describing products Shure 's vocal mics truly earn title . They take enormous amount abuse never . Toss around , drop , stuff , etc. , NO problem . When maintaining bunch music gear , 's nice tools never worry . For reason , I 'd highly recommend getting used one find deal . , working order matter . 
799	I 'm pro means . I enjoying guitar . It I expected terms playability range . It tend overdrive little bit . More guitars ( pro ) . One screws jack loose , nearly stripped , I got . A drop wood glue fixed . Had I paid $ 300 guitar I 'd upset , easy biggest complaint finish body thicker less & # 34 ; natural & # 34 ; image appears . It 's pretty enough , fine $ 100 guitar . But I really wanted & # 34 ; natural wood & # 34 ; n't . Otherwise would 5 star . I play every day . I 'd first like say I bought guitar Amazon $ 65 , lot cheaper 's sold ( currently $ ) . It 's wonderful guitar inexpensive solidbody , looks little different picture would lead believe . For one , guitar n't `` finish , '' even glossy -- 's solidbody wood , sanded smooth given deep wood stain . Secondly , guitar pictured much lighter color actually . The photo shows looking almost like red colored wood ; reality , 's much darker , deep brown , akin , however , affect playability , wonderful . I bit buzzing one fret , easily fixed good sanding polish . The guitar also strung tuned easily , though guitar body style 'll continually tune-and-retune strings keep tuning . It 's heavy , sturdy guitar , solidbody two humbuckers 'll likely find one sounds meaty smooth . Being , I wanted first guitar Dean . Sure , plenty options , I head thats I wanted . Well , I must say I happy purchase . Guitar arrived triangular shelf box , inside another Dean shipping box , wrapped bubble sheet packed inside yet another , larger , Amazon box . Was essentially ready play right box , quick turns tuning pegs . One knock I seen online buying tuners n't hold tight , I yet problem week playing , including drastic bends . Checked steel straightedge light , neck dead flat straight . The edges frets could use finishing , still bit edgy . I seen others mention filing bit , thing would done expensive guitar factory . I probably get diamond files well , I keep hanging hand bottom neck . I 'm expert tone , nice even sound responds well pretty much pedals effects I 've thrown . I restring mine DR Neon strings using Rocksmith , required adjusting intonation . The low E A strings ended end range , A actually still tiny bit flat . This could well factor particular strings though , I wont knock guitar . As others noted , finish vary drastically . Mine much darker stock photo grain much less noticeable . Overall , looks nice piece , especially cost . I could ask better price . From I hear experienced players , I progress I could easily upgrade tuners pickups , though I think I leave one alone get higher end guitar time.OVERALL : Nice looking , feeling guitar : Excellent value.Good quality looks good right upgraded time : Tuners may may slip playing variable , willing accept whatever shade get . I little reluctant try EVO I Vendetta tuners junk . Fortunately guitar 's beautiful looking guitar nice setup . Action incredible . Almost low lot stretching great fast riffs . The difference tone neck bridge pickups great pickups responsive.Hardware slightly better expected price point . I bought one years ago little short cash , I skeptical would work , After guy set played flawlessly say least , Once got tele back acoustic Gibson back , ( life work guitar player , always pawn shops best customer ) able incorporate Dean , And gave another electric play , This cheap little Dean guitar turned favorite , Plug sit back enjoy comes , Very crisp noise , So looking good cheap guitar either learn something pick play , And never anyone tell sounded horrible , And got tough times , That bought another one practice , I hope able use review decision , Bottom line ca n't go wrong guitar ... ... ... ... ... ... ... 
800	Nice accessory , hold plenty sticks , angle makes easier get quickly . I brought husband drum set . He loves . It made nice . I & # 34 ; happy . well organized always reach .

801	Love pedals good buy Double bass pedal quality frame , quiet build transport.Solid attachment bass adjust reversible nice pedal twicecas expensive , great value . These pedals great ! ! A friend mine said I buy pedals pedals n't manufactured known brand name I went judgement I disappointed . I increased speed lot since I 've gotten em I pedal songs like `` All Long '' `` Beast '' = ] great pedals . BUT , takes time develop speed n't think pedals suck barely get em ca n't go Jason em I bought son 's 7th birthday . He badly needed upgrade Ludwig Jr Kit 's bass pedal . This great pedal younger kids , people learning double bass first time . Seems little slow , , I said , 7 year old perfect . Seems well build , pros gigging musician , may want save change buy better pedal . 5 stars price I expecting get . I n't expecting pro level gear sub $ 100 pedal . When I purchased pedal local music store I n't even looking double pedal set , replacement pedal came Tama kit . During quest pedal feel I wanted I sat behind Pacific drum kit pedals . At first I ignored second bass pedal played bit right pedal hi-hat . I liked feel right pedal ask store single pedal configuration I decided see like playing double . Wow - immediately expanded range opened plethora possibilities.This pedal nearly infinitely adjustable , especially cam rotation , spring tension , beater offset . Most adjustments require hex wrench , fairly standard modern single double pedals . The left side slave pedal full , linkage rod connects right left pedals bind angle I tried . There slight lag left pedal , normal double pedal configuration , 'll quickly compensate get used double pedal moving single I purchased particular model I tried Tama 's Iron Cobra , Pearl 's . I like stiffness Iron Cobra , like Pearl Gibraltar pedals . It finally came either , slightly smoother , significantly expensive . I opted best value without sacrificing performance quality thrilled pedal.If moving single double pedal configuration I strongly recommend give one serious look . More importantly , try pedal local store compare double models - selecting bass pedal personal decision many factors price , features quality . It feel right . In addition , find using double bass hi-hat , means need compensate . For I recommend Gibraltar hi-hat drop clutch ( ASIN ) , allow engage disengage hi-hat ease . I hi-hats set slight opening normal closed position , stepping hi-hat pedal - using clutch - puts full play position . lever clutch closes . This clutch perfect companion double bass pedal ! 
802	: I 'm , pedals always looking amps take well . Before current set-up , I played Fender Strat run effects Vox AC15 . The Vox sounded great I two problems : 1 - The tube amp made worry amp could crap middle gig . 2 - At 15 watts , even though loud , I 'd often crank amp keep rest band , tube amp increased , 's natural gain . That would normally sweet , would color effects different tone , often times leave feedback Fender Frontman 212R ! This thing TONS clean headroom , seems like built pedals . I crank amp keep quiet , tone changes done effects . This benefit solid state amp high wattage lots clean headroom . It makes easy dial sound every time , matter volume play , 's Fender reliable ( 5 year warranty ) . No tubes means tube issues . Yes , n't sound good Vox , 's I things worth mentioning : It 's heavy Vox ( tube ) amp . I carry one hand guitar case 's got speakers . They push serious sound , low punch . My Vox better speaker , 12 inch would often get stressed high volumes . This amp puts wall clean sounds put ! My Vox may better recording amp , better gigging amp every day year . I two wound selling one I never used . The one I kept currently serving keyboard amp two keyboards ( simultaneously ) : aRoland RD-300NX Digital Stage Pianoand aRoland V-combo 76 Key Stage Keyboard . I able two inputs front amp . Input 1 designed normal sensitivity Input 2 designed guitars active pickups . Thus far I problems boards connected time , seem matter board connected sound impressive . Exceptionally clean , amp provides controls allow contour sound , helps significantly running keyboards . Moreover , amp loud choose make , even high-gain settings ample want distortion , probably amp . You switch clean drive drive , essentially still clean sounding amp . I find plus , I met share guitarists think great feature daisychain amps using master aux amp ( ) . You also use two jacks run effects loop . I personally use features , I see could useful.Overall , I love amp wish Fender made single 12 '' model pretty heavy bulky . Those hardly significant complaints since I sometimes regret selling second one something happens one I still I would replace immediately . First I bought recommendation sales guy store . That mistake . I looking `` Clean Fender Sound '' without paying big , friends , 's . Tons headroom , clean squeak want . Tele players fall thing practice amp . Young players heavy metal absolutely love price . It 's LOUD , 's clean , fair amount distortion , although coax distortion . Add Danelectro Distortion pedal sort Amazon distortion 're home . I nine amps , including Fender , Crate , Peavey tube models , cleaner . If play C & W ; , look . If , amp . banjo , mandolin violin ? This amp ! But , follow darker side , keep looking ... Try get version w/the black cabinet around $ 300 's major music stores charging . In case , I really looking twin 12 '' speaker pair amp head cost much , , combo ! The clean side amp exactly - clean . This amp tons power spare . In house want turn beyond 3 . Ca n't even imagine 8 9 might like . I separate effects stomp box I let amp sound like almost ANYTHING . The big plus unlike real tube amps need cranked pretty much get right sound , set 2 still get pretty much amp sound ( I using ZOOM MS50G ) . All hard beat , practice session well small mid size gigs . Only thing I miss bit headphone jack . I playing 9 years . Have owned many different guitars amps , tube solid state . Currently use ... Marshall JCM2000 DSL 100 w/1960b MG Super Champ X2 w/Carvin Frontman 6 Spider III 120 Watt 35 Watt Combo solid state amps , one sounds best . In fact , amp sounds great , gets plenty loud , affordable , junk brand never heard . Has great clean tone lot low end . Reverb sounds great well . A little overdrive sounds good unless use much , gets quite noisy loses clarity . Remember , amp NOT metal . If high gain , stay away . If ANY kind music , amp fantastic quite good price . Also , unless playing drumset , amp overkill far volume goes . 100 watts necessary bedroom guitarist . If ANY kind music , amp fantastic quite good price . All amp good buy I recommend anyone market solid state amp price range ... .But would n't good review without cons . So mine . These means deal breakers I find quite SWITCH IS ON THE BACK ? -I find annoying reach around back amp feel power switch every time I turn . It especially annoying like limited space stack amps top . With another amp sitting top Frontman , power switch even harder get to.EFFECTS IS ON THE FRONT ? -The last thing I want see around rig messy wires everywhere . When using effects loop , one deal looking two wires hanging front amp could hidden back . Not end world I n't understand . Why Fender ? IS ON THE FRONT ? -This one bad , adds messy wires IS NOT includes `` Channel '' `` Boost '' buttons . A third button `` Reverb '' would IS MADE OF SUPER CHEAP I expected anything different price range , `` wood '' used soft , CAN NOT pick back . I could easily break piece bare hand I wanted , exaggeration . I know I first got amp I went pick I immediately stopped I could feel -- LINE -- ... -This best amp matches sound need 100 Watts loud enough want Fender name sound without huge price-tag.DONT BUY ... play metal/hard rock-This first plan playing bedroom afford tube amp

805	, Amazon rejected first review I mentioned competitor name ( ) . Let 's say price excellent , much better competition , cables work great . How 's ? These cables good XLR noise-free cables . With cables , I able get good sound behringer XM1800S microphones . I pro drummer run pro sound support PA systems outside venues well time time . It essential I cables carry great sound make speakers reproduce acurately crowds . These 50 ft xlr cables made well , I hear virtually sound loss distortion long lengths . And usual dealing GLS Orange County , came fast packed well safe . I continuing returning customer quality , price service . And though particular order I need contact , checked make sure everything went well . Great folks deal . I use stage wide could use anything shorter . Most stages bars , clubs restaurants small enough use 25 ' mic cables reach stage box snake , . These GLS Audio cables transparent sturdy 2 months I using almost daily basis . I performed many setups tear cables indication problem coming time soon . The quality good ( smell funny first opened ... I worry China 's lack environmental concerns ) , sound first class , quiet , matched pair , I quiet signal path . These great xlr cables . We run form board mains excellent ! I several cables zero complaints . 
806	This perfect compliment current set . I needed desktop stand voice overs usual recording set would n't trick . This stand sturdy worked perfectly . A great buy price perfect well . This really solid table mic stand , 're going find better price ( I looked ) . The base solid heavy , actual stand sturdy metal tube . I liked first one enough I ordered second . I note , though , come pictured adapter smaller mic clips , I imagine disappointing even though n't affect . This item really speaks . It small microphone stand meant use desktop . The base nice weighted , heavy unwieldy . It 's solid piece serves purpose offers convenience anyone looking place microphone would recommend grab shock-mount n't already one , transfers vibrations though stand ! But honestly expected . This stand works fine n't need shock mount . The base wide heavy enough secure mic well defeat vibrations . I ran trouble trying mount mic shock mount . The low height ( 4 1/2 '' ) - would otherwise help stabilize mic - left little clearance mic desktop . If think might upgrade someday use stand shock mounted mic , 're better buying slightly Stage Adjustable Desk Microphone Stand , , copy stand also 3/8 inch male thread . If find need desk mount microphone , one works well . It heavy enough keep microphone tipping , black stem gives subtle appearance desk . Having microphone always plugged , accessible desk ready go means I save much setup time voice-over work . This mic stand solid good value , 's one trick pony . The picture currently featured top listing incorrect ( stand comes 5/8 & # 34 ; threads come adapter ) . Not huge deal 're using standard mic height 4.5 & # 34 ; inches total I 'm using mine mic kick drum right port . If plan using stand amp mic something podium desktop , I 'd highly recommend check adjustable desktop mic stand On Stage . I one , tall ( even 's shortest setting ) mic drum port , adjustable height handy .

808	We live age endless boutique guitar effect pedals . One could make expensive hobby collecting high dollar dirt pedals . It 's unusual see online review think pedal sounds good find costs $ 150 , $ 200 , $ 250 , $ 350 ... whatever . There LOT really expensive distortion/OD pedals there.I 've Bad Monkey 7 years , hearing good things I took chance gigged many years . I rarely use lot gain pedals , tones easily get lost mix . I generally use Bad Monkey mid-gain crunch tones , 's two tone controls makes difference . This pedal , midrange-heavy TS . Anyway , thing sounds great . Excellent classic rock lead tones.The things WO N'T : 1 ) clean boost . It plenty output , 's always little bit dirt signal , ca n't used pure clean boost . 2 ) wo n't clean turn guitar ... least much . No dialing crunch tone turning guitar volume clean rhythm tone . I Barber LTD , despite limitations , Bad Monkey awesome . At least great `` throw case take jam '' pedal , 's worth pedalboard , well . This good TS type pedal great price . The ability adjust treb bass nice . The enclosure metal , knobs feel sturdy , switch durable feel . This analog pedal Digitech pedal I 've ever contemplated keeping . I ordered pedal Amazon days ultimately sent back redundant arsenal . If n't TS type pedal good , cheap choice . Personally , I n't think sounded better ( worse ) TS type pedals ( Behringer TO800 , Joyo Vintage Overdrive , Deltalab , TS808 TS7 ) . As I indicated , I tubescreamer sound well covered lol . I opted instead Dano Cool Cat transparent overdrive I happy . If n't TS type overdrive thinking dropping bunch cash TS808 , may want check first . I 've pedal five years . I bunch overdrive pedals , including Boss SD-1 , TS-9 , Klon clone , bunch DIY pedals . The Bad Monkey cool couple reasons . First bass treble controls . Most overdrive pedals one tone control , Bad Monkey lets sculpt highs lows . Second mixer . Not everyone appreciate feature allows jack pedal mixer audio interface `` speaker sim '' .The gain sound ok , I use boost output turning gain way slams tube amp giving natural tube overdrive . This pedal work best tube amp people may dig gain tone solid state.It 's built like tank . Ca n't go wrong price , IMO . This purely overdrive pedal , distortion pedal . It increases gain tone , actually distort sound.If 're metal hard rock player , n't buy . It 's better suited country , soul , R & B ; , blues , even jazz players want boost volume umph 're solo . For 's excellent , especially considering low price.And despite low price , 's solidly built . It 's like update point I 've used Bad Monkey pedal tube amps : A Fender Blues DeVille 4x10 Line 6 Spider Valve MK II running Ampeg 4x12 . I idea 'll sound solid state amp . But sounds great tube amp.This update point I finally tried solid state amp sounds pretty darn good . I recently bought 100 watt Fender Mustang III combo use practice amp . It perfectly compliments Fender Blues DeVille Mustang floorboard combination . As I 've said , I use Bad Monkey boost soloing . Whether I 'm playing clean dirty , Bad Monkey gives guitar rich/deep/great sounding update reiterate awesome pedal . I rarely play directly amps , e.g. , Fender Hot Rod Deluxe , Blues Deville , Super Champ x2 Ampeg , I 'll turn gain Bad Monkey use much fatter `` clean '' sound . It 's thick , like texas lots umph . You 've got get pedal . I love pedal . I bought one used GC day $ 30 never looked back . Before I using Joyo Vintage OD also excellent 808 Clone pedal able tweak highs lows better . I set level set 9:00 , Low set , High set 9:00 Gain set next tuesday . I prefer beefier tone little less highs . It also nice smooth OD cheap 808 clone best I used hands 808 - $ TS9 - $ Bad Monkey - $ Vintage OD - $ great pedals money really sold Maxon 2 1/2 times better . This pedal makes Les Paul sing . Better I imagined , even good reviews . Such wide range sounds ; warm jazzy boost , great blues overdrive , almost Black Sabbath distortion . Makes crappy Behringer amp sound ... almost good . I think pedal good value overdrive pedal speaker simulated 2nd output makes great value stand alone guitar preamp ! I plugged DAW listened impressed sound . The overdrive quite good . No , ca n't hold candle Pedals Signature Overdrive $ , 's good buy . While I n't ton experience pedals , I really love one . Keeps guitars tone add fatness mild fairly substantial crunch adds nice sustain . Although tube-overdrive I actually think sounds better solid state amp . It nothing real drastic exactly I looking , nice robust boost keeping guitar tones integrity . For price I n't see beat pedal . I also Digitech Jam Man awesome . No complaints . More knobs always better . In case pedal , controls really sensitive , 's pretty big mid hump 's hard dial , low end control make things really boomy , add little chunk sound . You lot , I struggle find best , n't really edge distortion well ( n't clean ) , 's really high gain distortion pedal , add bit tightness , hair metal mids , thump standard OD sound . Basically , amp set 70s rock , stomp get maybe Moon era tubescreamer , thing lets little bit clean signal hear distorted guitar mixed clean signal . The circuit design nothing like tube screamer , work substitute ( I think wanted tube screamer sound , theJoyo JF-01 `` Vintage Overdrive '' better simplicity sake clone ) .So 's bad , level boutique pedals clones . If get tired , give bass player try bass interesting tone . If listen read many pro guitarists techies say DigiTech effects pedals , 'll tell stay away ... except one . That 's DigiTech Bad Monkey Tube Overdrive incredible value could go head head pedal made BOSS $ 100 TS-9 fact TS-9 Tubescreamer pedal Bad Monkey best compared . This meant heavy distortion pedal endless game - simulates overloaded tube amp adds crunch little gain otherwise clean tone . Notes sing chords really crunch , especially blues classic rock . But since pedal works well boost , I 've heard guitarists turning Bad Monkey conjunction distortion effects , really push new best feature Bad Monkey far two-band EQ . Virtually distortion pedal `` Tone '' control make tone darker brighter . But since one band EQ basically takes away bass add treble ( vice versa ) , may find sound want . That 's 's great Bad Monkey - feel like tone weak , fatten . If 's muddy , add treble . And make changes without compromising parts tone extremely durable - die cast metal , probably heavier BOSS pedal . The switch similar BOSS Ibanez pedal , I find easier use.If 're beginning player player budget , would outstanding pedal , along traditional high gain distortion pedal . There 's really need spend extra money Tubescreamer , prevent buying something else need gear . But even player money object , n't Bad Monkey . It might tube overdrive pedal 'll need . This pedal beyond loud . It 's point crank pedal 15 watt amp 8 & # 34 ; speaker , get noise complaints end neighborhood . To match clean tone I get amp , I set level 1 2 . I Boss OD I realize matches well little Vox tube amp , I use Bad Monkey pedal I go direct low level headphone playing . Good price , good tone , pretty versatile , I like mid boost harmonics I get Boss . The might work better solid state . replacement TS 808 09 tone overdrive works good enough . The BAD MONKEY overdrive pedal produce `` Crazy Train '' metal distortion . It n't made , thus buy sound 're target . ( If 's sound want , I recommend : DigiTech TL-2 HardWire Metal Distortion Pedal . ) What BAD MONKEY produces delicious , bluesy overdrive highly competitive price ( currently sells $ Amazon ) . Unlike many overdrive/distortion pedals , BAD MONKEY independent ( sensitive ) dials treble ( `` high '' ) bass ( `` low '' ) , using greatly affect resulting sound ; means token dials . In particular , bass dial used increase bass amazing degree ( especially using double-coil pickups ) ; 's easy achieve `` fat '' sound pedal . The pedal come , accept , external power supply ( i.e. , adapter ) . It also powered 9V battery , installed 's literally pedal portion ( BOSS pedals ) . The BAD MONKEY made metal used weapon needed . It seems extremely rugged , like BOSS pedals . I several overdrive/distortion pedals , I find turning one . My impression BAD MONKEY based using [ ] Ibanez guitar good double-coil pickups , [ ii ] Ibanez guitar good single-coil pickups ( similar `` soapbar '' style , P-90 , pickups ) , [ ] Fender Mustang II amp . It works well single- double-coil pickups . If I lost pedal , I would order another right away . I 've playing 30 years say confidence great pedal . I like sound pedal ability get right drive sound I want . I 've used reissue 70 's Fender Strat plugged 1968 vintage 50 watt head slanted 4 cab . Love sound . I also using pedal Ibanez GB 10 arch top jazz guitar I amazed good drive I get ! ! I 've also owned tube screamer , I like one better ! ! I 've tried like pedal , I really . Maybe 's signal chain ( ? ) My experience DigiTech series suck tone guitar . Sure , OD , n't worth losing tone , ? Again , I reiterate maybe 's . I messing around signal chains almost 3 decades . And blue pedal n't different , either IMO . Grunge OK , kind style . 
809	I 'm giving one 5 stars , caveat MUST GET THE SILVER ALUMINUM one , otherwise black thermoplastic ones break . The thermoplastic ones broke within 2-3 months use , 3 different ones , I got silver one problem . Every music store I go locally black thermoplastic ones , look disbelief I say break . But -- I leave guitar fret 5 10 minutes go kitchen make tea , thing literally snaps breaks 2 3 pieces goes high speed 2 pieces , could poke someone 's eye public performance , freaky . There 's something rainy days higher humidity cool damp air pressure and/or temperature fluctuation it.I live northern california , I n't know dry climate like southwest would problem.The SILVER ALUMINUM ONE contrast , n't broken nearly year use , shows hints . It feels different hand thermoplastic -- hint plastic , light heavy like G7 ones . I made sure order silver aluminum one Amazon , since description black ones say aluminum thermoplastic , I want make sure I get aluminum one.The silver aluminum Planet Waves capo really best capo I 've ever , super easy use , easy put switch one fret another 're going playing one song another ( n't move body guitar like capos put move , spectacular design ) , keeps strings tune better capos , 's way hands , n't interfere play chord . The screw adjustment perfect place least strain n't hurt fingers turning . It 's least obtrusive best capo ever . I 'll also add I old carpal injury I want least strain , small hands , I want least awkward light capo , . I absolutely love , I 'm glad aluminum ones durable . Nice design ... Small , lightweight easy use , dose job well . I thinking getting 2nd one . This inexpensive capo works advertised . It 's plastic version expensive metal one works advertised ideal light weight backup . I 'm happy purchase . I bought Black Friday sale . It works I use . When use , gets put away . Does n't take lot space . Purchased capo bad experience spring style capo . This capo perfect needs . In 40 years I every kind capo . This right one . This one works . Buy one guitars keep case : well made inexpensive enough . It really good one change tone songs make easy play ! It good job 's primary purpose capo I gave four stars . It works flawlessly , one minor annoyance n't easily stay head guitar except nut screw bit tight could mess tuning guitar . With clamp capos clamp wood . Pretty darn good every way . Trim easy use . Solid construction . I recommend capo without reservation . I like small . This fantastic little capo . I say little big spring loaded type , Shubb capos I 've used.It low profile , I reach right still play well.It seems sturdy well constructed , I love I easily adjust much tension put strings . Just enough n't buzz strings stay tune capo cheaper G7th , job well everyone saying ca n't fit neck , make sure get right capo ! If classical guitar , get classical capo ! If guitar really thin neck get lite model capo . If like people regular size guitar necks , get normal n't write bad reviews product bought wrong kind . I love capo better I seen used . Great quality price . You wont go wrong capo . I n't classical guitar , I got inexpensive really fun steel string guitar non-radiused fingerboard . I 've also got dozen capos ( n't ask ! ) radiused fingerboards steel-string guitars -- electric acoustic -- radiused , , flat . They gentle curve , gentle many would n't notice unless looked closely . Look `` fingerboard '' excellent discussion Google images diagrams though curve gentle , fingerboard radiused , capo must curved , , outside strings would pressed properly would buzz . If fingerboard flat , like classical guitar 's , capo must flat , , center strings pressed properly 're sure whether guitar 's fingerboard radiused , slide ruler two frets . If lies flat , fingerboard . If rocks , fingerboard radiused.I REALLY like capo way pressure adjusted turning tension screw . This makes possible right amount pressure -- tool little , would cause strings buzz , much , would cause instrument go tune.As others noted , one drawback ca n't clamped headstock use . But , I 'd replace capos radiused versions capo . HIGHLY recommended ! My eleven year old guitar player happy capo . It 's easy use adjust . Love capo electric guitar . I adjust tension position neck easily . Tried expensive capos , one Winner ! In price point - 's good capo - know put one use . I use lessons case kid steals - I 'm losing G7 capo $ 40 . Great capo . The instrument works well Yamaha nylon strings , steel strings I want pressure , I advise getting NS Capo `` lite '' , I prefer one model . You turn knobs every time want use . What pain . Oh well , cheap enough around . This awesome capo ! It 's sleek , light , easy install ( one hand ) looks nice instrument . I use NS capo Gibson SG Special faded exactly supposed . I love dial , 's easy use lets set right amount pressure I still bend strings fret buzz . Awesome product , much better using Kyser puts guitar tune leaves neck . Sounds great SG wondering yes clamp headstock tighten enough . I think also depends width headstock works . There 's nothing like capo . I two . I 've played guitar 40 years used types capos . I like one 's low profile fact provide pressure fretboard ( turning knob tighten ) rather rely spring , clip-on type . It takes seconds longer install clip-on type , I like results better . Was sure one darn easy use works quite well . I still use stuff great backup . We ordered one , worked nicely , ordered 2 . You adjust tension precisely fit guitar , minimize string stress de-tuning time move capo . Very nice product . This nice product use . I would recommend anyone . It small enough way playing . Great item ! Sturdy , weeks . Small , light , durable . Holds strings perfectly Great capo ! These nice , easy use capos price great . I got several use guitar class , someone n't capo needs one . Works well , arrived fast . No problems . Works described . A good purchase low priced acoustic electric I purchased Classical guitar traditional ( steel string ) Capo available . Not thinking I used Nylon times I realized damaged string point replaced . Along string order I added Capo happen : It 's small 's well made . It looks great also appear high quality.It 's adjustable . Unlike steel string Capo , uses screw/knob tighten , spring loaded . This allows finely tune capo add enough pressure bar fret damage stings.It works steel strings . Yep , I found self needing Capo another guitar , I saw reason work I gave try performed wonderfully . I wo n't using full time steel strings , great know pinch I use it.If need great capo thats gentle Nylon strings one get . I always seem re-tune spring loaded capo 's . tune one . Highly recommend . I ordered one I like Planet Waves Capo lot ( I believe older metal version , & # 34 ; Lite & # 34 ; ) . However , one screw enough hold strings , especially lower frets neck little thinner ( Martin jumbo acoustic ) . It barely bend strings behind fret enough prevent buzzing . Your fretting hand naturally push capo back position quite easily playing open chords too.I 'm sure plastic version issue appears identical design old metal one . It n't seem defective parts bent missing far I tell . Unless I happen get one shorter normal screw , I would n't recommend guitar without thick recommendation classic Kyser capo thats dependable quicker apply remove ( also attaches headstock effortlessly use ) . If looking screw-down style , I would look older version avoid & # 34 ; Lite & # 34 ; . 
810	To test I installed one pad left original pad side 440 's . The pad larger surface area ( see pics old pad left shots ) I guess spreads pressure larger area . But 's really minimal I notice huge difference pressure wise . The material original plus . Every often I would flip headphones around see I could tell anything . The larger pad cover ear- almost surrounds . But seriously , blindfolded I would n't bet life I always knew side . But general large pad softer material seems better set . I ca n't imagine set cans actually feeling comfortable extended period time.Sound difference ? Yes , one side test sounded better I felt ... I switched around ! Just like eyes two ears 100 % equal time lose edge equal rates . I think make kind big deal significant improvement degradation sound might imagining . I would see proof believe whatever ' worth difference drivers may sit relationship affects sound waves actually strike . thinking inside heads maybe ? Notice reviews- bassy , less bassy etc ? ? ? It becomes highly subjective I would n't buy buy pads based upon claims . If need replacements brainer cheap way keep expensive headphones alive . If need comfort may trick I 'm glad I n't pay I Amazon . That 's 2 cents . Brass Tacks : They . They fit ATH-M50 headphones . That I wanted.They perfect fit , slightly larger , 's snug . Looks good ! ( Remember : Because material , WILL notice slight difference sound . ) I got recommended replacements Fostex . They fit great far comfortable stock pads . For price , worth . I n't , rather . It suggested forums good upgrade 440s terms sound comfort . I n't believe sound part , I bought I least wanted replace cracking old pads 440s . When I got , easily went looked good originals . They definitely comfortable . I n't know , something sound different I n't think 's placebo . There seems presence bass clarity places I would n't expect . I highly recommend upgrade . I used pads numerous headphones like trp50 I say far best , inexpensive solution headphone fit . They ave made sound quality better headset I put , softer comfortable replacement pads I tried price range , Highly recommended ! 
811	I received cables today packaging come quite simple . However , two zip ties secure cables together need careful cutting damage cable knife scissors.These , `` Value '' cables . However , seem sturdy perfect budget home recording studio use . I like Audio Technica made something like XLR cable look pleasing quality , far I 've getting clean signal , even cheap Pyle Pro PDMIC58 . I replace cable came mic really awful . Hopefully AT Value cable hold ! I 'll update review anything looking decent cable low price , I would give try . I purchased cable use multitude purposes around home studio within live rig.I bass player trade , though I dabble many instrument ( many us ) . I typically run direct recording lately bass amp many live shows , sound system adequate , via SansAmp VT Bass Deluxe modest home studio I often need XLR run feet DI interface AT cable works well . For thin flexible cable , I notice noise issues interference problems.I also sing backups stage I typically run mic TC Electronics Mic Mechanic pedal , ( great us outboard effects processors vocals ) mixer . I use AT 10 ' XLR run Mic pedal allows right amount cable routed securely show , I run standard XLR mixer stage snake cable end rugged feeling solid feel connecting disconnecting equipment , unlike many cheaper XLR cables . This cable , least 10 ' form , sounds good Mogami Silver 25 ' XLR . I know many cheaply priced XLRs noisy problematic . I several . I n't worry problems cable purchasing lengths well compare Mogami short , I would recommend budget conscious musical professional novice alike . Much better economical one 's sold . I gotten 15 foot , live learn . My studio small needs wrap around desk go sound-proof closet . It matches awesome AT2035 microphone . This cable well constructed . I use DJ business I highly recommend anyone needs one like . I use desk mic I use recording . It perfect length connectors excellent quality , especially price . Definitely would buy mics future . 
812	I 've got couple part I 'm satisfied . On , absolutely problems . On guitars sometimes n't register low E. Usually , moving around helps . I love thes , I keep buying every instrument I , I never ... I already owned two Tuners previously & purchased friends . They great jamming friends & user friendly & accurate . What really impressive stay attached headstock guitar whileplaying making touch tuning breeze . I love mine & friends . In opinion price hard beat . I two . One guitar case holding Martin HD28 case Blueridge flattop . Just clip nut tune away . playing next n't interfere tuning.Works great ! I owned every tuner made . They pluses minuses . I like one lot . It tuner choice right . The backlit screen great tuner accurate . It also small , I appreciate . For price ( $ 15 ) simply ca n't go wrong . This neat little tuner . It cheap buy Amazon delivers outstanding results tuning . Unlike tuners , one picks notes easily gives smooth accurate reading . I love way folds flat I get instruments case still clamped . I keep one guitar another fiddle times . There forgetting tuner misplacing somewhere losing . It 's must . It $ 15 Amazon worth many times amount . This thing little jewel . I jazz guitarr & oacute ; n , i.e. , modified Mexican Mariachi guitarr & oacute ; n custom strung third E middle C , Hz . This little tuner job . It works clipped onto head , bridge also , guitarr & oacute ; n bridge bit wide , clipped directly onto lower edge sound hole , i.e. , near treble-sounding string . There works perfectly consistently even lowest E 's entirely way since right hand coming strings near string.Bold_strummer mentions buzzed classical guitar , initially I found problem , BUT turned NOT tuner 's fault , mine . After tuning , I gotten habit turning face wood instrument . When I made enough contact surface instrument create buzz . It took two weeks figure making buzz since noise coming directly sound hole even though I tuner clipped head time . When I realized turner , I NOT turn instrument I n't using . Ever since , buzz . Brilliant , huh ? : - ? Another reviewer 's idea getting two keep spare packed gig bag great one . At price , ? This great little item . This tuner bright backlight , padded clip , rotates , pivots , flats , calibration . Simple use . Runs one CR 2032 battery ( included ) . What 's like . 5 stars way . I 4 others different cases one work bench . They dependable easy batteries . This one goes case tele copy , I Edit . particular unit respond quickly identical tuners I . I accurate , n't respond string fast . I still give 5 stars This little tuner precise . It 's fast , easy use . I got two . It works better ones built-in mic capture sounds make difficult tune instrument . Works guitar , bass , violin , string instrument . The Intelli IMT-500 -- The tuner killed Intellitouch ! There scores chromatic tuners market . Most work using small built-in microphone picks sound waves . In order used effectively , tuning space must relatively quiet . Many tuners input jacks allow electric guitars connected directly tuned electronic signal produce . A bunch years ago variety began marketed . The microphone could clipped instrument cord attach electronic tuner . Now , anyone could tune instrument matter background noise.Then , Intellitouch tuner hit market . The entire tuner clipped onto instrument . One could tune acoustic instrument noisy environment . There cord deal instrument could stay clipped headstock quickly removed slid pocket case . Talk convenience . festivals ( bluegrass , folk , whatever ) became seas Intellitouch tuners.Intellitouch owned market even though many situations work well . In particular , trouble bass notes dreadnought sized guitars . The overtones instrument produces , worse tuner behaves . The bass string Martin rosewood dreadnought near impossible tune without using one many workarounds owners developed . So , much love-hate relationship . The shortcomings huge , convenience meant tolerated.Then , came Intelli . It Intellitouch worked , perfectly , whole lot better . The amazing thing switch Intellitouch Intelli n't gradual . Within six months introduction , jams festivals became seas Intelli tuners . People throwing ( n't lucky enough find die hard willing buy one second-hand ) get Intelli . That 's considerable investment . But , ? The Intelli half price Intellitouch works whole lot better . They inexpensive 's easy justify getting one practice area one case n't worry forgetting pack ever tune acoustic instrument noisy environment quickly find tuner indispensable . And works darn well quiet environment , ! Highly recommended ! I used tuner classical guitars ( ones nylon strings ) . I teach classical guitar opportunity use many different classical guitars varying quality . It tuned well . A great advantage I 've found using tuner ( Tune Tech ) verses tuners use microphone , I talk students tuning longer ask please quiet I tune guitars . especially like talk I fully engage conversation tuning guitars . The problem I 've noticed , thus 4 stars , I usually begin tuning string low E string . For reason , tuner seems trouble sensing low E vibrations needle move . This problem always resolved I tune another string tune low . Pitch registered quickly minimal needle . noise disturb tuning sensor3 . Small . head ease viewing screen.5 . The screen bright also easily seen direct sunlight.6 . Rubber feet clamp scratch . Clamp strong open wide easy squeeze open . Being chromatic tuner means stuck tuning EADGBE . It 's tuning range 12 note . - . Will automatically turn 3 minutes . Delay tuning low E string2 . Buttons rattle tuning 2nd string , . Plastic screen scratches n't yet know long button battery last much battery replacements cost . I update review I information . But , I pleased tuner . I owned many electronic tuners one far beats . I also used tune guitarlele tunes darn near perfectly ! Great chromatic tuner great price - I love ! I 'm taking KORG CA-30 , backlight , slow reset time , ridiculous `` stand '' feature - put business card slot back , try find level surface stand upon - putting sock drawer decades old guitar pitch pipe . Also going Intellitouch tuner , drives nuts fit securely fiddle , mandolin guitar , I 'll use received Intelli IMT-500 compact ( great cases ) , outstanding backlight , superb accuracy quick resetting.The Intelli , manufacturers box ( shock-absorbing material ) , placed larger shipping box `` The Instrument '' , without shock-absorbing material , leaving Intelli , sensitive electronic metering device , subject vibration shock long trip east would good Amazon teach sellers basics proper packing shipping.It 's rocket science . This second tuner I bought like . I got I need second tuner . They good tuners I highly recomend tuners company makes . ... great either . The `` needle '' never seemed stay still long enough isolate pitch . It also appears tuner n't reliable pitch end either . Recently ordered red SNARK tuner Amazon , I think 's much better- Intelli fact folds snug guitar going it- snark little , important thing comes tuners accurate pitch , readability- Snark wins ... tuner works sure , I n't think 's best there.The Snark cheaper ! recently bought one gave praise team leader . turning accoustic guitar players make sound , always pull cable connect guitar tunner . gave save time . first doubt would work like tunner , tried pleased accuracy tune accoustic guitar players playing . 's time treat gift , n't leader band practice . also want mention product made ! 's rare thing see days . I use time acoustic , well autoharp daughter 's fiddle . I 'll getting another one soon keep fiddle case ( wanted teach basics tuning ear first another instrument like piano keyboard ) . This works well noisy jam rarely gets confused . For acoustic guitars lets easily tune open G even 's noisy hear almost always stays mandolin case gets used often banjo well . I 've used tune autoharp although clip stretched pretty wide still really gets excited tuners , I 've playing long time nothing like around I know I started . If wanted tune n't 1/4 '' input , good luck .

814	I 've owned pedal 8 years . It 's good overall , reverbs fall short ideal . They sound bit , noticeable times , band setting probably would n't noticable . I think 's way trail . The tails tend little unnatural decay , something.I 've using Boss Fender reverb pedal 3 years main reverb ( neither amps reverb ) I 've done last year I use Digitech wetter setting ( usually church hall ) I want reverb solo . For application works fine sounds great . As `` leave time '' reverb I find bit want bunch decent sounds could much worse . Plus thing obviously rugged , I 've abused ( really , regular gigging abuse ) time 's never failed work . But 's overall experience Digitech stuff long time . This pedal super ... tons verb want ... . makes amps built verb obsolete plug this.. I highly recommend stuff ... I coupled pedals stereo awesome ... thanks ... . love shopping Purchased replace Behringer pedal Behringer introduced `` swishing '' sound . This pedal good choices reverb types relatively noiseless . Good product got good price Amazon . I use pedal mainly & # 34 ; church & # 34 ; setting ambient volume swells . It seven different reverbs choose ( including reverse ) . So definitely suit needs whatever require reverb . It ruggedly built digital , like others wo n't . I like . That said , I taken liking digitech pedals well . They sound good affordable . This great-sounding reverb pedal . Tons options ways manipulate sound . I 've combined Epiphone Sheraton II ( semi-hollow body ) able get awesome deep , rich sounds ( watch feedback though ) . The design solid , controls quite easy use . Honestly , I think lot reverb settings I wo n't use much , 's problem there.I definitely recommend reverb pedal fans , U2 , etc . Or 're looking pedal boost sustain create deeper tones , . This definitely enhanced creativity guitar . My caveat review I n't tried reverb pedals , one definitely suits needs . This pedal OK , need reverb , controls simple sound good , much expensive units , pedal compared expensive units , sound digital clear features basic , worth one fun , I recommend product , DigiTech quality top line dont worry , general good unit . This pedal well constructed goes batteries like CRAZY ! You want get power supply opt unit.I 'm fond sound quality reverb LOT better sounding units folks might find I would recommend product . I 've pedal number years . It provides wide range reverb effects , sounds natural killer stereo output . I 've n't heard pedal competes spring reverb , pedal keeps simulated reverb pedal I 've heard excellent job amps lack spring unit . The effects go way beyond spring unit well . Recommended . 
815	Excellent Product , well cushioned . I 'm typical American . Great Price ! ( Lucky ) All Black fully Assembled ! Does n't get easier ...

It fits gear back ( rolling duffle style ) contains cables / power strips etc. , folded legs sticking bag . I KT7800 , much larger seat area , easier adjust . Depends preference I suppose , one smaller / lighter , larger / easier adjust . The Keyboard lower I anticipated . The seat soft comfortable . However , n't appear hold anyone excess weight . It comfortable seat seems stable well-made . However , need haul around frequently , takes bit time set screw open screws hold moving stability bar bottom seat . Also , need adjust height , remove entire bolt assembly seen crossing point bars , select one three holes inch apart . So , much selection . For , I click nearly perfect height . The padding great , lightweight without feeling cheep . I bought daughter plays keyboard . It already assembled right box , seems well padded sturdy . My daughter likes . I like price special deal Amazon . This assembled couple minutes without need refer instructions . The bench comfortably padded affordable . It n't top line gets job done . I would n't abuse chair much though , material looks little . I 'm heavier fellow ( 5'11 , 220 ) harder I 've tried tad uncomfortable long sessions . This one , hand , comfortable plenty padding support . It folds easily looks well made . 5 stars , complaints , much nicer lot expensive options . The price great selling point , . I use acoustic guitar On Stage FS7850B Guitar Foot Rest I bought Amazon well . It 's good combo . It leads playing longer periods . It 's solidly constructed . It folds definitely portable .

817	really nice I found easy put use guitar easy play . thanks I 've buying strings . They sound clean crisp . The best part price . Great beginners experts . The sound great easy fingers . I got recommended friend I like purchasing 3 pack I multiple guitars replacement strings . You ca n't beat price . I started purchasing lot guitar supplies way . I fussy person guitar strings . They either sound good n't one matters . I pleased getting 3 sets price delivered front door . There many different strings go flow look company logo outside . Martin top . These strings sound light bright . Very pleased purchase . They wonderful product ! The lighter strings acoustic less taxing neck guitar , ca n't go wrong . Nice light set strings allows easy fingering allowing longer play/practice periods less finger fatigue . I would recommend anyone likes light lively sound acoustic . especially good beginners . 
818	It 's pop filter . In case one n't good enough , double ! Works great . No complaints whatsoever . No need fancy $ 50 metal mesh screen . This works good . This pop filter trick everyone blown away see double filter . It still made plastic quite easy crack trying position long carefully last awhile . Pop filters already work great block wind unwanted noises microphone . And extra filter , blocks even . It 's simply amazing . Worth extra bucks get double filter . If I want I blow directly filters 'll block wind microphone pick soundwaves . Works exceptionally well . In fact , works better regular , single-layered pop filters I used past sound either compromised sound barely effected would worth money . The build design pop filter sturdy attach majority microphone stands . Very nice pop filter ! I use condenser mics ! It works perfect hard P 's strong S sounds . It 's built well adapts almost mic stand . It makes lot simpler mixing vocals . And looks professional ! I would n't mic without , I know big difference makes ! 
819	Most 12AX7 tubes electrical engineers say . , I ca n't honestly tell , sure , Electro-Harmonix tubes measurably better no-name Chinese tubes I replace . But I THINK Electro-Harmonix tubes sound better , therefore . At $ 12 per shot , cares ? I suppose I could experiment settle question , I 'd rather spend time playing . Rest assured Electro-Harmonix GOOD stuff price right . Just . ; - ) Needed pre amp tube Hartke LH500 ordered one ... waiting ended buying using 12AX7 Groove Tube one still sits gear bag , waiting powered . If time comes Im sure great tube . I retubed Carvin combo duet 3 EH preamp tubes . Wow - come life make amp sizzle . The price right AMZ . I like tone one better stock one Champ Kustom . Also , I like JJ , difference subtle . The JJ version seems bit brighter slightly noise ( good way , I want ) . Received new Hartke 2x10 bass combo church , tube pre ss power amp . The preamplifier one 12AX7 . It EH . It went microphonic ten hours playing time . After talking Larry Hartke , decided I got bad tube . He would send warranty replacement . My suggestion - new stock tubes probably tested prior installation . Replace stock tubes tested tubes someone like Doug 's tubes , tube depot , , reputable tube vendor . I ' trust ebay tubes wo n't spend hard earned cash NOS . Replaced JJ , used Tungsol reissue . Like previous reviewer , I bought switch stock one came mic preamp , wonders warm sound . Only problem , I eyeing amp , 's tubes , thinking ... one little adjustment made difference pre-amp , imagine fender ! ! Always something ! Anyway , great ! I sure I get ! 
820	It easy apply , great results little effort . I 'm surprised results . Never got shine guitar product . great stuff ... .only problem ... order ... guess im used lemon pledge furniture ... works fine ... smooth slick finish ... yes ... guitar slips little knee ... happy wish sometype order ... yes..nice First wax I bought . I usually n't wax . I tend use cleaning sprays . I going waxing . Gerlitz makes wax easy , greasy . This tin last lifetime . It comes applicator designed contours guitars . I would use minimal amount still get . Leaves smudges . My classical guitar sounds better dose NO 1 GUITAR ! ! ! ! ! I purchased wax brand new guitar help minimize scratches back though I make every effort avoid , protect side I rest arm playing keep wearing finish time.I 've used car wax many years ago , much higher grade , easier apply , easy remove.There really tiny cracks polyurethane finish I notice first I actually able fill using couple coats product look like tiny smooth surface . They minor affect wood , seal . Not sufficient defect return reviewer mentioned problem applying metal . I open tuning machines , applying applicator , I used wax , let dry buffed pure cotton towel . The chrome gleaming . They 're really beautiful . Did great job headstock well abalone inlay strings removed . Also got tuning pegs . This 000 - OM acoustic . Only way I imagine harming metal slightly dampen sponge , ( I used distilled water ) someone left much water - possibly problem , worked fine . I bought wax compared Meguiars I 've using years surpasses Meguiars miles . I guitars really shine wax , really see depth paint wax works great headstocks also . I like applicator fact paste wax effortless high end guitars , I also beaters . I used wax old Squier thoroughly used looks fantastic . fine scratches blems gone guitar looks great.I use old shirts buff wax guitars found comes chrome easilly , I older Les Paul guitar surprised see wax come ease . I buy stuff , local guitar shop sells price . This stuff works amazingly . If interested buying product , n't listen people say dry . I thought worked good , mine bit dry . This stuff n't supposed really waxy , hard wax I would think supposed cracked . Mine n't cracked , worked great ! I love product would definitely recommend say must-have . 
821	I bought years ago try . The `` gel '' name sounded intriguing . These OK , colors bright , otherwise 're standard plastic picks , electric I prefer nylon 's less `` clicky '' strings . These fine , I pull one gig bag I 'll use , overall styles pick I 'd buy buying . Nothing wrong , 're normal plastic picks , nothing special maybe brightness colors . I tried three whim impressed favorably . In fact , good I purchased ten I went back music store . My favorites mandolin picks like Golden Gate Grisman `` '' . The round side Dunlop gives similar attack nice warm tone . I would recommend anyone . If reason 're looking pick specific color , nice set . The bright colors make difficult lose . I used Extra Heavy picks many years still searching perfect pick . Its strong enough play metal blues style rifts strong cracks . I like fact wont turn powder fray playing either wear fast playing heavy gauge strings . I like Fender Mediums , always , , I got ta man . Not sure picks yet . The feel little stiff usual . I want last longer . What happened days carried pick around pocket months played round ? I recently ordered wide variety picks find ones I liked best . These sounded different `` gel '' picks . I like . Being see . They little scratchy edges . Perhaps experienced guitar player would fine stage I still looking I - I ca n't use well . Not light bendy , heavy stiff , picks right . Dunlop also makes quality picks , I yet break one . They last long time . I guy first I wished n't purple , since Dunlop codes sizes certain colors I like much I n't really care color anymore . I bought pack picks much less money local music store I would recommend looking first . Now please stop cutting milk go buy . Now ! They play well hold well ( never one break ) They second favorite pick . But pick better songs favorite . I actually forgot I bought heavy medium versions pick . It 's bad pick , I continue use I wish softer center , softer coating grip pick prevent turning falling fingers . 
822	... works fine me.I used connect Orange Micro Terror Head Micro Terror 20W Hybrid Guitar Amp Head ( Standard ) cabinet PPC108 1x8 '' Speaker Cabinet Bought several worked fine . I later moved Planet Waves custom pedal board I could get lengths perfect . This cable built last . Overall great quality cable came quickly . What could ask As things life , get pay Hosa effects-connecting cable n't best quality cable e.g . , Evidence etc certainly job 's supposed reasonable price . Too guitarists , I one many years recently , pay enough attention quality cables hence spend much time amps , pick ups , strings etc . I discovered way late important investing high quality cables sound I guess better late never . However , budget looking effects-connecting cables job good price Hosa ones good enough job . For , much experimentation I Guitar best sound cheap certainly quality worth money improved sound provide.These Hosa however still good value money hence come recommended . Without going cables worked well guitar effect noticeable hiss , hum buzzing . Clean & quiet.Good buy price . It 's cable . It works great . I n't see reason spend money short cable like . These great patch cables . They make strong connection pedals n't sacrifice sound quality . I 've using many , every day , quite still working great . It 's well make cheap compare product Amazon nowadays market . replace guitar cable , work fine , I 'm happy unit . Recommend someone need replace cable . I bought cables use guitar pedals practices live gigs . I complains time . I use hosa products think making products excellent quality lower price.100 % recomended . use cable patch effects pedals together needs . right angle ends make easy connect pedals keep close together . 
823	I love boost pedal much ! I owned MXR Micro Amp , I found colored tone way much ( much low end ) . The MC401 hand n't color tone . It provides precise boost pushes tube amp natural overdrive . The boost extremely articulate produces throbbing palm muting clear chords . If 're market boost buffer , I 'd look . This pedal affordable , sturdy , sounds absolutely amazing ! I play amplified upright acoustic bass electric upright solid-body bass . I bought Jim Dunlop MC401 MXR I bass solos ca n't heard players unless I boost volume , hard reaching volume knob preamp amp hand . This stomp box lets instantly add pre-selected amount volume boost -- goofy effects , hum , extraneous sounds . Of course , solo , another click foot drops boost . This thing sounds completely transparent 's , completely natural 's . For purposes , boost five decibels 20 device permits seems enough . Naturally , left head room available amp otherwise wo n't hear volume change 'll get distortion , obvious -- 's like turning amp , except MC401 runs 9-volt battery , I also separately ordered Dunlop ECB003 AC adapter , also available Amazon . I checked Jim Dunlop website specifically recommends staying voltage adapter , I order , model . The ECB003 adapter works perfectly seems completely silent.The MC401 , 's stays put . The stomp switch appears made good steel , case . Everything solid rock . I n't see could better . Perfect . This great effect . Awesome engineering Jim Dunlop 's MXR products always presented . The true bypass feature high-end quality materials make reliable dependable . This CAE boost pedal sensitive delivers . I actually believe exceed expectations . You dissappointed . Ships fast . Highly recommended . I use boost effects loop 's preamp section amplifier . It gives boost I need leads without tone whatsoever . I always one board . Very well made . I 'm using pedal like clean boost leads , I 'm happy 's sound . clean gain ... A good pedal miss . Super transparent boosts signal degradation cables . To ears restores high end shimmer brings back life note . Best used pedals right goes amp . 
824	Nice , works problem.Sound good.So far good , used almost month . Regular strings . They work , last . They worm sound really like , takamine sound great I happy sound strings . The steel wound strings sound dull nylon strings sound tinny . For extra $ 2 I bought D'Addario Pro got much , much higher quality sound 40 yr old Yamaha . Spend extra $ 2 well worth . These strings sound great . I really impressed sound . They stay tune nicely . Great beginners intermediate players . I would recommend . provide good sound , minimal stretching past couple days setting , good lows highs , good value They cheap look good . They also nice full sound holding well . Highly recommended . 've used d'addario strings bass , electric , acoustic , classic . even though string first time use n't failed yet ! ! 's stable tune time playing . highly recommand ppl This string compares significantly Pro-Arte string . The sizes costs buck two less . It 's similar I contacted D'Addario ask difference . They stated Pro-Arte strings made better nylon stringent specs ... honesty I wonder strings n't identical marketed primarily students schools economical string.Whatever actuality -- sets quality manufacture . They 're D'Addario ... D'Addario never produces junk . Their cheapest string good better expensive strings brands . I 've never used set D'Addario classification guitar I n't curious , I 'd recommend I : buy set set Pro-Arte ( 're pretty inexpensive ) compare see like best ... like equally . I think would good get several reviews test two . set one ultimately , ca n't go wrong quality/price ratio .

826	It 's bad . It would better I bought one large enough finger . Still , I 'd rather stick Copper slide . I purchased first guitar slide . I loved one month , fell finger shattered tiny pieces . I almost cut ! I never buy glass slide , I recently bought Dunlop brass slide love . The difference glass metal glass muddier , mellow tone , glass crisper , louder , break . I would suggest anyone . The metal ones price , n't break , sound way better . There 's reason ALL pros use metal ! The review wrong . meant cover finger , way tip . You n't bend finger play slide . You retune guitar open tuning . Just thought I would point . A little small taste , thin , works well Dunlop products always professional musician . This great glass slide , ring size seems smaller announced . My finger stays tight . Not uncomfortable , takes effort get . Clear sounding slider works pretty good studio . I drop couple times ( ok , maybe couple ) wood floors stages without problem . Then one day , cold outdoors , I dropped concrete floor completely shattered , oops . I 'll start saying I prefer metal slides glass ( tone snob I ) So I n't excited playing , I played ! The tone amazing ! ! Great highs , amazing lows , smooth midrange unbelievable harmonics ! I use metal slides ... And dunlop bottleneck ; - ) 
827	yes tweak less , cant even use recording without amp much hiss unusable . I 'll keep short : I owned Boss EQ pedal past n't much luck . I tried tried tried hone sound I looking Boss would n't . Fast forward years I purchase little baby whim . Man , I glad I ! The 6 sliders made easy dial exact tone I looking . A small boost first two sliders gave amp could ever manage , small boost last two provided balanced , well-rounded sound . Love would n't wan na part ! The pedal built like rock . I imagine nothing shy nuclear war could dent thing . The individual sliders , although quite rest pedal ( haha ) , feel nice slide easy . Each slider lights red engaged , looks cool makes easy see dimly lit stage.If 're fence EQ EQ brand buy , I recommend give little monster stomp . This great effect . Awesome engineering Jim Dunlop 's MXR products always presented . The true bypass feature high-end quality materials make reliable dependable . EQ sensitive delivers . I actually believe exceed expectations . Ships fast . Highly recommended . Bought whim . It works well utilized amp direct fashion . When used pedalboard rig , n't add much except hiss , unfortunately . Sweet sound older Fender amp unit , though . Does sound good updated equipment , Line 6 equipment , Roland units . I 'd say definitely get 're tech gear head . Get 're simple player FX arsenal . It sound good utilized amp guitar , amp , wah , guitar , amp , wah , guitar , expression pedal . Nothing else I 've tied seemed work , though . Probably wasted product I 'm headed technical player , good beginners intermediate levels . King styles ? Do n't go modeling . This little box give . I personally play bass I thing long effect chains . I count little arsenal fuzz , , auto wah , compressor , octaver , bass booster nice DI Box . The MXR EQ helps great deal `` recuperate '' definition clarity long effect chains I love . A great little looking clarity , definition even little extra punch sound MXR EQ trick.Cheers ! ! ! I disappointed last EQ pedal I owned witch Boss , colored tone much , pedal much musical layout essential frequency 's great , plus lighted ez see . course MXR built like tank last ever I several MXR pedals years ... I always found quality good price ... fact , pedals exceed competitors ' products less half price ... ( certainly higher levels quality priced n't mean much better ) If need little tone sweetener , pedal deliver ... flatter EQ 's fairly noiseless ... EQ 's , boost certain frequencies pretty high , get noise ... Simple use I particularly like lighted LEDs band ... feature makes unit good choice stage ... As MXR pedals , built solid road-rugged ... For price , nice pedal , simple use built last 
828	My new go-to strings . These things last forever someone plays casually . They sound great . Absolutely recommend . I purchased Elixir strings hearing repeatedly recommended music store . Put Eko Ranger XII acoustic 12 string . Have 2 problems strings . First , bass E ( string ) broke tuning . Had go music store buy single replacement string ( Elixir ) . I changed strings many , many times , I convinced stringing , weakness E string . Second , high D ( 8th string ) seems `` dead '' ; `` ring '' high strings ( though none much 12 string sets I 've used ) . Considering strings cost much others , I certainly disappointed . Hardly matters last longer n't sound good . I 've used Elixir strings years I would never change . These excellent tone last four times long others . I really like strings sound bright go well guitar I hope last quite I put bout month ago guitar lightly played I try update I change These strings performance value always give great sound . I using Elixir 's 5 years last longer ( even salty air environment beach ) sound better anything else I ever used . Taylor ships guitar strings - good reason ! They sound wonderful - right box ! Like most/all 12-string guitars , lights extra lights often appropriate - feel smoth easy tome generate , tandum instrument , bring 's best resonance sustainability.Give 'em try ! I buy Elixirs acoustic guitars . They last longest hold brightest clearest tone string I 've ever used . The nanoweb coating really make huge difference . They take several months wear ( opposed weeks major brands last ) . They may cost bit competition , try love much I , 'll never use anything else . I 've Yamaha sound really good . A tad brighter I like , 's nature lightness strings . It 's real smooth playing seem lasting longer strings I try . In fact , I 've strings 4 months still feel sound good . These favorite strings . They last long time fingers n't hurt I play . I tried Martin strings hated . These favorite guitar strings ! They long-lasting sound great ! I would recommend anyone , beginners even people play seriously perform . They good strings , worth cost ! : ] The Elixir brand acoustic guitar strings keep brand-new 'sound ' lot longer brand . I happy Elixir brand strings . I Loar Guitar weeks seem work fine . We see long last . I used Elixir electric last longer I wish bit longer . I 've used strings longer strings I 've tried ( 7 years ) . Last year I switched D'Addario EXP16 's sounded better guitar I , still keep pack Nanowebs backup . Here pros cons string : Pros : fret play strings . I n't know ; I looked tension stats strings seem equivalent higher strings . But certainly easier fret ( press ) play string I 've tried , including coated ones . The coating Nanoweb strings thinner Elixir Polyweb series , still feel smooth even ' , people remarked . They little string squeak.+Last longer strings I 've tried - maybe brightness , strings mellow age ( strings ) never really sound dull . The reason I saw change became overly dirty broke , usually every months regular playing.+Very bright sound , cuts well playing live full band , sound cheaper guitars . However , also con ( see ) Cons : strings , including coated strings.-Can sound overly bright , especially higher end guitars . They tend sound guitar , good cheaper guitars without quality woods construction , good guitar already resonates well . For reason I switched EXP16 phosphor bronze string current guitar . The EXP16 coated sound complements ' guitar better Elixirs ( although easy play ) available export outside U.S . When I working abroad , I used buy U.S. company would ship . Elixir changed policy prevent , I ended switching strings cost Elixirs abroad high . I kinda strayed away Elixir brand little `` To See '' another brand would sound `` better '' , I wasted time money . ( I get ) I 'm back Elixirs intentions `` Experiment '' put ... ... ... ... Elixir makes best Strings Acoustic Guitar I 've tried I `` Will Stick '' Great Sound , last long time , easy clean prevent rust and/or corrosion . I use mediums bought nephews Takamine sound awesome guitar . Always love strings . This kid changed strings years I thought I would give best chance keeping guitar sounding good long possible . These strings little money average strings , last longer . Great dedicated guitar player . 5 stars , arrived time good condition . Price excellent . Will install one acoustical guitars within next day . All I say , , , You try set Elixir Nanoweb 80/20 Bronze Acoustic Guitar Strings . You want go back set strings . I 've using Elixir strings many years . They better feel , sound , last longer brands I 've used playing Guitar . Elixir excellent quality control . I 've never problem . Lately I experimenting various make acoustic guitar strings ... less also expensive strings . I find Elixir excellent . My testing ongoing give Elixir top rating yet . That may change along way.However , I believe guitar strings bit like food wine . What may appeal palate may appeal someone else 's palate . Therefore , strings may sound good ear may sound good someone else 's ears remain future string sounds . I also love d'Addario make . Which I purchase Amazon ... always . I love , love , love strings . Super great sound super long life . I 've acoustic 6 months , sound still awesome . I 'll definitely buy . Elixir strings great . They hold tones longer . They n't rough textured easier fingers . I Taylor ce acoustic guitar Elixir Strings nice guitar came Taylor new . I figure done research works best I see reason change going fro extra light strings light weight strings . The sound get Nanoweb strings amazing enhance results already great guitar . They also last long time go dead . I 've written review . They excellent . Never broke string , I play home hobby . therefore abused . I 'll never use another string acoustics . The reduced finer squeak , long lasting coating , great tone strings wonderful . I 've tried couple cheaper brands recently , coated uncoated ... come back every time . Great set strings . Cant go wrong elixirs little priced I hoping get long life make . I 've using Nanoweb Polyweb ( idea difference ) Elixirs consistently years Martin Jumbo periodically try brands whenever I see something might compete , especially another `` extended life '' `` coated '' string released . I would happily Elixir $ 13 set someone offered cheaper option worked well . In fact , I quite $ 9 D'Addario EXPs I heard tone begin evaporate days like string . Nothing I 've used point gotten close challenging quality mighty purple box.The sound get Day 1 crisp beautiful expected . That 's Elixirs kill competition though . It 's 20 hours play show strength . You still hear fresh , bright tones set would already crossed dead zone . In fact , I typically start breaking begin sound dull . I play relatively aggressively use palm-muting constantly , allowing skin oils eat right strings tone lasts longer ( stated box ) might stretch question get least double life less twice cost occasional player music shop owner , no-brainer . The coating extremely effective effects time oxygen exposure . For everyday , aggressive player simply get better tone longer point criticism : packaging issue . WHY would manufacturer still utilize tree-killing paper envelopes allow strings get stale ? I 'm seriously asking ! I 've got missing something . A shred plastic sealed around 6 strings greener , , keeps strings fresh ( thank YOU D'Addario , I 'll never leave electric strings ) . I would happily buy Elixirs bulk I faith shelf-life . snapping prematurely probably valid , happening someone gets set 's sitting around . Think buy places move lot units ( like Amazon : ) I use elixirs taylor 1 , last months end maintaining new string zing , 2 soooooo smooth . It 's like playing silk guitar . Get strings . These expensive , seem last longer , start wear , develop ' - I assume - nanoweb wearing . It n't seem affect playability . These great guitar strings guitarists say . They tuneful , make ordinary acoustic guitar sound beautiful . My concern strings n't wound properly seem brittle break . e.g . Low E A strings vulnerable G string.The LIGHT version I find , particularly suited finger picking . After month half I noticed A D strings 4th fret . That little suppost last 3 5 times longer `` regular '' strings . I like way sound . They little harder play D ' Addario strings I used guitar , Martins I used past . If I still change every 2 3 months really worth extra cost . They twice much usual D'Addarios 2 weeks use , I could n't happier . I 've heard positive reviews Elixir strings understand . They smooth butter thanks coating sound bright , clean , crisp . They also make guitar look much nicer shinier . A great buy overall . Regardless string , I insist honesty advertising marketing . So I considering ordering string I read summary , stated : '' Elixir Strings coated unique way protect wound strings DNA '' ... protects string DNA ! Yeah , DNA really guitar strings right . In fact 's worst EVER ... worse even oils skin ... worse cells contain hold DNA exposure DNA cells , contained deep within protective walls . But somehow nasty ol ' DNA leaks contaminates guitar strings ! Honestly . It 's like none us ever class 're musicians ? As I read reviews , I noted review review review seemed like sort marketing promo . I noticed one reviews indicated actually purchased product Amazon . first honest review I found one said , `` These strings sound somewhat artificial . '' Ah finally , one REAL reviews.Look , product may good . It may best string ever . But I going spend time money testing string apparently ca n't stand quality without marketing hype ? We 're musicians , morons . If want us buy string , totally honest marketing . A quality string sell performance , sound long life . No matter heavy marketing hype , string bad 'll sell one set . If 's good ... n't need : After reading numerous reviews , actually seem good set strings . Which means product stand customer testimony alone n't need spin sell . Just sayin ' . ; ) 
829	well I say . takes signal splits 4 ways offering output HP level . genius . I bought church since 're going HP monitoring route best bet super priced shure/senheiser/audio technica overpriced systems . I paired works great . hook xlr straight DI voila , got inputs separate control . like I said . genius . I 'd give 1 half stars I could . This little Amp noisy hardly touch/move cable plugged . It hard get full sound . I hear one ear every , hardly anything . I always adjust cable 's connector get full sound second . I still use , hardly . I really n't like . Perfect remote recoding 4 head sets . Clean amp plenty gain great price . Solid rock definitely delivers promise . said Behringer gear sucked clue audio gear . Our radio station owns several pieces along unit expanding gear purchases Behringer gear . Super value ! Needed boost headphones playing Rocksmith . Item works advertised , easy hook . I using xbox 360 wireless headphones ( , production , still work great ) I hooked output Mackie mixing desk . I powered monitors ( via Y cable ) one output headphones another.I play guitar , write , record , etc speakers headphones quickly switch without messing cables whatnot.Because headphones closed ( DJ type ) cut lot background noise I previously found wondering `` speakers ? '' . It particularly awkward power switches speakers back . Not handy ! Now I 've installed headphone amp 's definitely become integral part setup , definitely worth money . Now I actually get music : - ) Another excellent Behringer purchase . Recommended without hesitation . The item shipped time . It working fine . The sound good . The problem I voltage . I live Europe I buy special adapter transforms 220 volts know A lot items USA work voltage 220 110 , anyway . I use recording studio allow musicians level monitoring headphones recording playback . So far I 've item week , worked flawlessly , given exact results I needed . Musicians love able control headphones , rather engineer control room raise lower levels . Do let size fool . This handy piece equipment 's easy set use . Just plug 1/4 inch stereo cable sub mixer HA400 , plug 4 pairs headphones set track overdubs . This perfect small home studio budget 's built like tank . Be forewarned basic headphone distribution system , adjust volume HA400 would wise purchase real long 1/4 stereo cable extensions headphones want isolate vocals . Behringer n't best reputations , gear great job price . This one . This gives plenty clean volume run headphones . I run project studio Apogee Duet interface . I needed sometimes I need monitor something another person room recording/monitoring track.My main headphones 770 Pro , Sennheiser HD , Sony , I others . All headphones comfortably driven headphone amp plenty gain tap I get good volume , even exact volume input , I find sound improved using headphone amp . It 's hard describe , feels bit little bit stronger . I 've Presonus headphone amp cost many times much little Behringer headphone amp sound better.The volume pots smooth noise I hear introduced amp . Make sure use quality sound source faithfully amplify anything goes . For instance , I run cable iMac 's built-in headphone output amp turn volume , I hear little buzz random digital sounds , 's amp , 's source . Running output Apogee Duet , sound clean strong.There annoying things amp . Obviously external power supply annoying , 's on-off switch , 's light enough everything plugged , n't want stay place . However , 's nothing Velcro tape desk ca n't fix , rest problems stuff live get something much less price decent pair headphones . I 've one I 've used years served well.I needed another I could get headphone mixes soundcard recording bands home studio.Simple set : get input source 4 outputs 4 people listen source one gets control volume. [ ... ] I use home project studio works great headphone sessions . I use time run extra set headphone vocal . It 's metal knobs great smooth turn . For money ca n't beat . Its professional quality Ive done professional quality work problem . This product works way . No frills , BS . Great price Amazon usual . When I first got blew headphones didnt work right desktop speakers anything . I glad say getting replacement headphones desktop speakers thing works fantastic . It small design amplifier 's job well . I good headphones , noise canceling headphones , desktop speakers hooked work fantastic . No unplugging plugging desktop speakers headphones back computer hassle everytime . Now I got ta turn control knobs wallah . I say works well price . The thing I n't recommend turning volume past 2nd notch good headphones might damage like mine . Anyways , I would recommend hate unplugging plugging stuff time want bass . Purchased two , one stage headphones one actually use box send sound elsewhere building . Works environments well , individual channel volume control perfect . No units . Not sure Behringer gets bad rep - compact , works advertised , affordable around handy thing built , solid construction - zero complaints . I using little amp heavily year highly recommend . The device extremely compact taking virtually space sitting right next mixer , exactly I expect & sound clean . Works great - great price - meets requirements perfectly . I 've using product . Only indoor really light use . So I ca n't speak 's durability time . But I like 's cheap , light , works . box well made last long time . controls tight loose sloppy . like fact daisy device . happy purchase buying know made quality functions perfectly . would tell friends buy problem . I use small studio use multiple headphones one stereo line . Individual volumes controls make perfect . I 've owned used years without failure flaw . The pots still work without adding noise , general device exactly I need . You wo n't find better deal basic headphone . My title says . I n't like AC adaptor . I work well strong . I liked solid . I always wanted link multiple listeners feed able control level , amazing 
830	I got tried . It 's great work quiet practice amp . You gain volume controls get almost realistic sound . I would recommend anyone . I give product supposed . I give single star failed two weeks return period . , I 'll give . Something like really last least year . Cheap ? 50 cents day good deal device nature . Sound good . Strange gain turned along volume hear anything . I used AC30 years , lost , decided make change buy these.Sound quality AC30 n't anything write home decent cleans gains , one clean ( tried strat tele , play jazz/blues mostly ) , mediocre gain , get lot better sound even free amp programs ipod computers ( buying buck connector cable ) , though , granted tend feedback problems use certain settings.For people worried , turned sturdy ( previously used , exactly ) 're determined settle phone amps , go cheaper models , simply buy AC30 , latter acceptable As amateur musician , I 'm always looking ways practice without chasing everyone house loud amplifiers . I thought gadget would trick , quality sound range adjustment n't meet expectations . I 'm new guitarist nobody else would want hear everything I play . I however , ball playing loud I want much little gain I feel like moment Classic Rock Guitar Headphone Amp . My Rickenbacker 360 sounds way I want , much clarity & # 34 ; smoke & # 34 ; I feel like dialing . It SO nice free amp cable floor quickly plug , put ear buds , practice anywhere I want , anytime I want . Downside : I wish little reverb dial switch closer match full size Vox amp controls small/hard read easy learn . You get pop turn tube warm time . : Hit switch putting buds sensitive . I plan pick versions amPlug Vox extend fun . This good choice . Buy one ! I bought Vox Amplug AC30 loved much , probably doubled ( tripled ) amount time I play guitar . I loved much I went got expensive ( $ 10 ) Joe Satriani Signature Amplug . I liked Satriani model also covered different tonal range AC30 , delay feature lot fun . But I serious questions Classic Rock Amplug . Why 4-star review Amazon - among lowest fabulous Amplug products . Would `` one trick pony '' ? Well , I tell , I completely blown away great Classic Rock Amplug , I 'm even blown away negative reviews . I 've tried number effects pedals plugging actual guitar amplifier , many pedal users seeking call `` Marshall-in-a-box '' . In words , want effects pedal single-handedly transform whatever amp sound stack Marshalls . Believe , Vox Classic Rock higher gain settings close `` Marshall '' sound I imagine . And comes small , plastic headphone amplifier runs 2 AAA batteries costs $ , Classic Rock Amplug AC30 - three dials gain , tone , volume , aux jack ( MP3 players ) , headphone jack , on/off switch . But 's similarities end . While excellent AC30 model simulates boxy , sparkly sound tube amplifier , Classic Rock packs . The low end presence thing ( even $ 20 set entry-level Sony headphones Target ) significantly greater AC30 . More importantly , sound n't deteriorate higher volumes . There plenty ways try play guitar headphones , become static-filled mess soon turn volume . Amazingly , tiny Amplug plenty power tap , `` overdrive '' controlled analog circuitry , amazing real surprise Classic Rock Amplug ( point upon I disagree several reviewers ) clean slightly overdrive tones roll back gain knob . Several reviewers referred clean tones weak , claimed clean tones . Yet , Les Paul Strat , I able set Volume around 6-8 gain level 2 get nice clean tone without loss volume . If dirt remaining , slight rollback guitar volume cured problem . Even better , playing Strat Classic Rock gain set somewhere 2 4 actually created blues tone ! This tone one audio demos offered Vox 's website , I n't believe I plugged Classic Rock dialed tone.Long story short , Classic Rock extremely powerful , verstaile I thought . It high-gain Marshall tones I expected , also offers wide array clean slightly-overdriven tones . It might even versatile AC30 Amplug , though I remain pretty loyal AC30 . The good news two models different enough cheap enough . Highly recommend Classic Rock - 5 stars .

832	Every midi usb converter amazon 50 bucks seemed sketchy , I tried one Casio keyboard . Works Logic Garageband , however whenever I try use modulation pitch bend , creates actual note Mac wo n't stop unless quit program . Be wary . Great price unfortunately product n't work .

I v-e-r-y close throwing Behringer unit away I thought broken ! Thankfully I tried old Yamaha interface OK . This means I need get buy MIDI cables I 'll back , I 'd say buy one , make sure works throw packaging away ! When work 're absolutely great 're SO cheap ! If receive lemon , return order another . It 's worth 're hurry . If hurry order , get something else.I 'd also like advise people reports MIDI latency devices quite probably misnomer . I strongly suspect speed transferring MIDI data computer device much faster think , actual latency 're experiencing converting MIDI data audio . This happens inside computer device 's performance ; 's purely hardware software configurations . All talk ASIO really going help audio side things . If 're using device record MIDI data issues ... long get one works ! : - ) Cheers . The cable came time promised . It worked immediately upon installing Yamaha keyboard windows7 computer .

834	Fender original parts ca n't beat . The head improvement & # 34 ; vintage & # 34 ; straight slot screw screwdriver slip scratch finish . These look like nickel plating I believe , size screw much cheaper hardware store , I chose Fender original parts Tele I recently finished one I currently working . These described - work fender switches ( , turns include screws ) , fender pickups . Used building pre-wired pick guards . They work fender parts . Even thoigh work many brands . Use makes complaints todate . It 's odd review simple thing screws : - ) What I say ? They 're shiny screwed well holes . I telecaster body installing screw pickup long body . I trim I probably could found screw hardware store OEM fit perfectly . Recommended . These work fine replacement mounting screws single-coil pickups mounted pickguard , though seem thick fit standard holes humbucker ( nothing little drilling could n't fix , 're inclined ) . 
835	I used last stratocaster build . It arrived quickly well packaged . It black kind white stripe along edge , looking solid black pickguard , aware . The cool thing pickguard already aluminum back . I shielding star grounding guitars one painful parts spraying adhesive back pickguards putting foil cutting fit . These already come foil , need shield already fit body perfectly I happy purchase . This pickguard used . It missing protective plastic actually scratched guitar . I picked I wanted change looks sunburst American Standard . The holes lined perfectly easy install 's 'd expect since genuine Fender part . The concern really whether color work guitar . At first , took getting used really darkened look Strat I like way came aged white pick covers knobs . I would think would reasonable assume would fit Squier Bullet Strat , holes n't line , n't fit neck bridge , fact , completely wrong . Nice quality though . fender pick guard . It 's pre-shielded . Perfect next build , replacing standard white guard set apart . Absolutely perfect . Some reviewer complained , I 'm guessing ; know pull protective layer . Mine shiny-new , absolute perfect fit Mexi-Strat . The price best , anywhere , free shipping , I could n't happier . It fit American Vintage 70 's Strat . My guitar 11-hole pickguard .

837	Wow . This amp something else . When arrived I almost n't realize big ! This thing everything ! You set drums , record cords dub already recorded track solo ! But 's even better attach drums , bass , mic , guitar killer jam session ! It sounds I time comb first glance features I know ! AMAZING ! Like another reviewer , I Fender G-Dec 30 ( BTW : going sale ) . The Spider Jam 75W specs I wo n't repeat info give users impressions instead . First I fortunate enough buy one $ 300 . ( price Fender G-Dec 30 ) , 's even simpler comparison . Line 6 Spider Jam 75W full head & shoulders taller better simply amp power & good sound . As rest , I 'll take line 6 's real drums sets song Fender 's tunes day . The ability save custom tunes JAM WAV files internally larger SD card godsend , single biggest factor amp ( I use max 2gb SD - note : must fat 16 & . ) The overdub layering simply superb ( though 's saved mono ) . The XLR mike , 1/4 '' plug aux & MP3 inputs allow great flexibility total song creation . Line 6 Variax guitar , I able produce amazing range sounds songs.The criticisms I : 1 ) - The menu process difficult G-Dec easy enough experience . 2 ) - The chrome plastic knobs look somewhat cheap work well enough . 3 ) - Line six really needs update SDHC format utilize larger 2gb SD storage cards . I experimented using SD card & though I able format , I able read / write . Line 6 , please go SDHC ! I would also like see improvement `` '' notched amp model selector pot . As every jump A B selection exact . I ca n't find single complain amp . The amp modelling fantastic . Plug player . Quality driver . I 'm going go features yo ucan read website . I used play separate amp rack get effects . Only thing I wish ability save custom sounds . But ca n't ask much price $ 399 . You wo n't disappointed amp . I bought Spyder Jam back 2009 , fairly new . I simply blown away depth available features amp . I still . It 's possibly one best training gigging tools guitarist . You play along drum track , drum AND rythmn track , get hundreds presets 100 make . Spyder pedals make perfect , allowing turn recording functions , drum functions , also expression pedal , get Wah Volume . The seperate tonal controls great amp , really dive deep menus , pitch shifting timing also available . And 24 minutes looping time , 's crazy price.I found interesting , Spyder IV 75 watter kind market 2011 part 2012 . It basically presets Jam without looper drum rythmn tracks , much less money . I 'd say started cut Spyder Jam sales . I noticed Spyder IV 75 watter back , Jam keeps right going , updates endless support Line eight year run Fender Cyber Twin , Cyber Twin SE n't offer possibilities Spyder Jam , Cyber Twin well $ 1000 new . Yes , tube preamp , rewires better simulate amps , Jam SO much line coming guitarists . No contest , . And gone want amp keep long , long time , take real hard look Spyder Jam . I 've Amp 5 years still works looks great . Took learn things Jam since I new world electric guitars amps I received . Crank baby moves air . I 've used 's 's problems . My rig consists Ibanez , Schecter Devil Custom 2008 , Line 6 HD500 , AKG Perception 420 thru Line 6 UX2 . Finally , I play home gear n't get banged agree > ( As B. Russell said : The downside I mention amp may technically challenged . There lot features amp , need learn use . The common features easy use , want dig start really taking advantage amp , need invest time . Since I 'm scared playing around menus reading manual , amp fits well . ) I Fender G-Dec 15 30 Line 6 Spider Jam blows away.The controls much intuitive G-Dec line ( like hitting level bring drum beat volume I could hear guitar ) , I able whatever backing tracks , drum beats I wanted time I lookin manual figure change tempo easy.I mention capabilities compare Fender go amp get takes bit proper foot pedal.The amp get really loud I n't see could use gig long venue larger standard bar side show.Since I amp short time , I ca n't say anything , I 8 amps different companies , quality way , I G-Dec 30 sale ? ? ? Addendum : The following take Jam 4 series , wish.A modeling amp literally model existing Amps , Artists , Songs different years.The Spider 4 board song drum loops like Spider Jam.If trying get specific sound band musician place time , 4 isyour amp.If need practice amp , go Jam.I amps far I concerned , Jam far better modeling amp Spider 4 plus drum song tracks play along plus whole lot , even based Spider 3 technology JM4 Looper engine.While Spider 4 ( I 150 ) nice amp , VERY SPECIFIC user needs isnot flexible.I agree amps worthless without foot pedals , I used Jam longtime without , acquired Express pedal I ordered Spider 4.Also aware Line 6 documentation amps , lacking , put mildly , so-called line videos user groups lacking documentation .

839	I Behringer DR 600 ( Ultra Reverb ) , unhappy tone limited selection reverb sounds . Although unit $ 10 , difference sound tone may well $ 100 difference quality sound . That , one really sounds super adjust preferences . It may every reverb sound , nice selection , cover impressive range , well giving option & # 34 ; wet & # 34 ; ( full ) & # 34 ; dry & # 34 ; ( tinny ) sounds & # 34 ; trails & # 34 ; essentially adds sustain . There 's also & # 34 ; echo & # 34 ; setting , 's pronounced , though add & # 34 ; & # 34 ; sound.So , complaints quality machine range effects qualities.There couple annoying inconveniences . One BRIGHT blue light ( indicating & # 34 ; & # 34 ; ) . This commented . I array pedals one bright others combined . When 's , ca n't read dials glare eyes . I find solution . I put dark nail polish LED bulb . I put wait dry reapply several times get dimming I desired.The second annoyance name pedal black letters dark blue pedal color . This impossible read stage ( even dim room ) lighting . Of course , & # 34 ; remember & # 34 ; one , Behringer pedals white lettering , making much easier read . Every B. pedal distinctive color , helps . My solution little dilemma buy 1/4 & # 34 ; white vinyl letters Depot put words & # 34 ; & # 34 ; pedal.It annoying make cosmetic changes , I 'm much happier pedal enjoy sound instead focusing minor . This inexpensive pedal kicks ass , provides everything subtle spring reverb reverb . The ' setting unique adds interesting modulated overtone couple octaves sounded note , providing strange harmony . Some people pick 're stuff ( still ) cheap . I admit two pedals ( 10 I bought ) underwhelmed . This one keeper ! Works well , many options reverb tweaks options . I would recommend pedal inexpensive reverb . I bought pedal enhance reverb sound amp . It work well . There different settings intensity reverb sounds . Nice addition price . Uses 9V battery power supply . Some things great values , others cheap . The Behringer cheap . The clips cheap . The clip holds 9V broke first change . The clip holds pedal also cheap plastic . IF get stuck using batteries , plan 3-4 hours worth use . It 's also noisy pedal . Like noisier Dyna Comp OD pedals combined . Like record pedal chain unless want mountain noise . If leave plugged cables , even powered , eat negatives aside , paying less $ 40 Reverb pedal several usable features . The 63 ' spring great , plate also really good . It also worth-the-price-alone `` space '' feature . Also known shimmer ( synth playing behind instrument ) . Paired chorus effect , get really cool tones.The RV600 without merit , bargain effect pedal fun use features . If gig record need reverb ... well ... n't even looking pedal . If play home low watt amp n't reverb built , good option . The reason I bought pedal & # 34 ; Space & # 34 ; setting , essentially shimmering organ , octave effect . On shortest time still slightly tracking , get crowded chords , sound : Time controls delay time dry wet signals , decay controls length reverberations , tone controls color reverb , mix controls level wet dry ( basically cut dry signal desired ) .The trails feature hold reverb sound decays even switch ; however , mix set max wet signal , sound come enable pedal . I n't really able use effectively , I leave trails ins outs useful plugging another : The classic reverb sounds ( spring , plate , room , chamber ) n't distinct one another . The hall setting bit expansive ; ducking nice continual shift note note , removing excess reverb latest played . The cave tile bit different timbre reverb sounds ; echo setting acts like short regular digital : *The blue led VERY bright , Behringer pedals ; I cover sticker , still shows . *the foot switch digital , n't preserve state , n't best assuring & # 34 ; click & # 34 ; buffered bypass , effect continue draw power battery cable plugged , even off*the battery difficult get press sides switch , lift upAlso , almost 50 % pedals weight bottom metal plate , removed , makes pedal almost toy-like weight . Up date February 08 2011 Wow look Them Not find My review helpful I much sooner , Not I care I tell truth good please Myself Not bunch fools . The first time I turned It It exactly Sound I looking Shimmer Space verb.Okay I Am ordering last one I guess I take easiest way ordering If It makes You feel better It put Me farther In financial problems If You look search still left . Behringer needs look The Is buying make . If Your buying Reverb Machine You must wanting It Its Ducking also called Shimmer Space verb If Not cheaper Reverbs Danelectro FAB Echo Is nice Sounding older type slap reverbs Sound Is expensive Line 6 Verbzilla , Someone wrote Me said Boss effect Internet videos showing effect . My Digitech GSP 2101 quit working right It Ducking Shimmer Digitech calls String Swell Is Violin type Sound They call Space verb verb I made mistake buying Behringer Slow Motion 200 thinking String Volume Swell Shimmer If found I looking Internet video I hope . I already Wrote Songs using My Digitech GSP 2101 started dreams Sound effect well Behringer RV600 performs Sounds I Not received It yet know If possible I date I Behringer Power Amplifier still works good I even used part , Doug coil machine would better use Also fan runs time . Bought Verbzilla , Digitech , verbzilla 's ripoff : Behringer types reverb get Verbzilla insignificant used synths .. many kind modes , barely useful . And I HATE fact line 6 always used knob instead separated level reverb/fx level , cos sacrifice volume get extreme reverb , sucks.Then tried digitech rv-7 . First thought .. Wow , construction 's got . Fancy knobs , additional stuffs like thick rubberized knobs cover , velcro , glow dark sticker . And fact soul . I love one better verbzilla , cos n't sacrifice volume get heavy reverb.. problem .. 's heavy reverb . I could n't get ridiculous amount reverb pedal . But I love reverb feature among modes . Every modes nothing special really . It light reverb finally tried blue thick plastic pedal .. skeptical first , see also mix knob like verbzilla I little disappointed . But I really sense 60 sings differently modes one . And I 'm happy mix decay could go ridiculous without volume loss much verbzilla . It could painful guitar players , cos boost guitar volume without anything else 's already full , I could always gain volume synth balance mix knob ( since never put volume knob synth full ) . I could sense difference modes pedal 's hell loads them.Let tell ugly truth 3 pedals 've tried.. ALL battery ! It ridiculous .. mean bad bad ridiculous lasted 5-10 mins use battery 's dried . So I suggest use power adapter . And thing hate RV600 way put back battery cover 's place cos put spring back 's track closing slowly , black plastic latch side n't feel could last n't care ppl said pedal , 's useful synthesizers , n't need get expensive gears long make great sounds . It 's comes back ability make good music . Good luck guys ! 
840	Works well - easily keeps guitars humidified less maintenance humidifiers I 've . Dampit recommended guitar instructor years ago , I used standard model time . It seemed kind tricky get hold enough water humidify guitar yet still get dry enough absolutely zero drips inside instrument.I used hang clip let drip dry 15 minutes I things placing I wound trying Humidipak humidifiers help recharge Dreadnought , I took putting Dampit plastic bag distilled water resealable top , pressing sides saturate , rolling Planet Waves Microfiber polishing cloth pressing end cloth soak . Then unroll cloth , put dampit headstock drop water would go hard shell case , rolling end polishing cloth cover wet end dry material pushing sound hole humidipaks . Worked I ordered super dampit new 000 acoustic planning . They ship without clips . Company says 've many complaints scratches , though I n't seem problem , n't take chance costly new acquisition . More importantly , supposed sponge absorb water inside tube I pressed sides tube , empty . So I sent back Amazon refund . No problem getting refund , I 'm moving dampit try planet waves insert sponge eliminated chance water dripping guitar damaging use soak polishing cloth described , still works great , 's really enough room OM model , missing sponge , try something else . If want get humidity guitar , product must . I works well -- one lives dry area country , must product . , say would . The nice thing & # 34 ; super & # 34 ; , size , turn , ability hold water . Dampit humidifiers around years years . I think I safely say basic design looks amazingly similar I remember I saw first time university days late 1970s . , used years . Sometimes rubber becomes discolored , sometimes rubber rips near end Dampit , basically workable way maintain least minimum amount humidity around instrument , something especially important winter months artificial heat zaps humidity air . This first Dampit product I 've ever purchased seems work exceptionally well . In addition standard Dampit , 's sound-hole cover . In case clear works , clear sound-hole cover short string loop end . You simply attach Dampit loop hangs inside guitar . My first impression excellent job keeping needed humidity body instrument , something important solid-top classical guitar . I would recommend standard Dampit sound-hole cover convenient ( hopefully continue keep fish around inside guitar runaway Dampit ) seems keep humidity focused area especially need . A must keep acoustic guitar environment gets much 40-50 % humidity . What else say , easy use , easy install easy check . I 've tried ones I come back . No expensive pads buy , use water . Simple drop body guitar , attempt fit rubber block thingy sound hole . Comes easy goes . I 4 . Love . I live Arizona I keep acoustic case dampit unless I 'm playing . It seems good job , although I would recommend purchasing better meter . The one comes simple paper design gives decent estimate . It works well . This classic design people used years I see . It n't broke , n't fix it.The suggestion I would make different soundhole cover . Maybe sturdy plastic ? The soundhole cover included cheap , disposable plastic looks like shipped cheap trinket . I think price little high . Rubber foam tube ? Why charge much ? I 'd like know .

842	The jam man solo AMAZING pedal . Yes looper amazing one . The one thing thought awesome played something save pedal . It handy tool . Another thing awesome pedals ability insert drum beats . If would % 100 recommend pedal anyone . It looper loop day way loop . What could possibly ask ? ? product great . lot nice features . running little Cube amp practice withand kind amp want use . best results going amp allows toloop another available channel bypass effects amp like distortion . amp overdriven , loop comes way , well smaller less noise solo rhythm part instance cancels signal sent pedal speakerand 're trying play pedal , good amp multiple inputs put . A looper pedal list things I 'd like get day long long time . Why I waited long get one , I ca n't say . All I say glad I I finally got one I got one . It fantastic . Here 's why.First , ease use . I really thought I 'd slowly working way long manual , slowly figuring use pedal . On contrary , I got box , plugged , recording first loops matter minutes . The instructions brief , clear , walk steps . This manual wins clarity great manual wars . As I deeper options I able quickly figure everything I wanted , user interface . It 's pedal . It 's got knobs buttons . This makes happy . It 's well laid easy get settings . Once 've got running , I strongly recommend setting set rhythm new loop tapping pedal . The work flow thing logical simple.Third , features . It built drum beats simple sound better metronome help get mood jam loops . The beat like guide track , recorded , plays nice computers . There 's usb port connect computer standard cable ( included ) copy loops free downloadable loop library software . There make basic adjustments organize them.Fifth , comes AC adapter . It actually since run batteries , still , I happy see , add SD card ( included ) expand memory substantially.All gives specifics overall experience . The experience pure jamming joy . I hear song head , quickly basic concept captured loop . You plug electric guitar mic input , capture anything want.For price wonderful piece gear , regret bought one sooner . I 'm much fun . Just wanted say pack lot pedal . I practice past 2 months I past two years . I highly recommend looking spruce song writing skills soloing skills . We got good deal . Amazon rocks ! I would give 5 stars way works 49 page instruction book utilize potential bit much . Something simpler would suffice . Really wanted record rhythm track play lead . If n't mind spending time learn 's capabilities 's great . sing 90s alt rock way . ? cause 's bad boy ( girl pc ) . It instant ideas . The thing makes simple effective simply record riff ( part ) , create around , loop loop , one idea another top . As simple sounds , otherwise , would record track , play , taking time killing inspiration process.There others market , sure . I boss looper 2 pedals , noisy playback . That years ago , I could n't get rid fast enough ! I 've used delay pedals whole life , fan shoegaze/dream pop , I always love layered , la church , chapterhouse , lush , house love , stuff.I looked youtube read reviews purchase , I n't money waste . This seemed best choice . The use live , especially without footswitch ( sold seperately ) , would tough sure . There stop start moments , case loopers . The one I 've seen seems seamless boss one roland one like 5 pedals like 700 bucks maybe . There demos guy looping different instruments running . For price , little wonder though , fantastic . The price ca n't beat , n't suck tone ones I 've read . The thing I would say , 's best recording , use audio notepad way . You use saved loops songs , since already formed , 's silly start song 5 guitars dense dance ! last thought , secret , come closer ... ... closer ... come I wo n't bite ... ... ... .A VOLUME PEDAL ! way layer different adjusted levels bending fixing levels . sounds simple , 'll see . I going look decent one . This great pedal . I bought extra footswitch go , makes alot easier operate . Does I need . Wish stereo . 99 loops , doubt I 'd ever lifetime need many . I n't tried computer interface yet . Although great deal learn fully utilize pedal , I recording hour & software Mac talking . It sounds great little 's noise . The percussion loops fine & least provide solid guides recording . I GNX4 I love & far pedal goes , I happy . I echo reviews suggest getting footswitch , help avoid spend lot time bent & fiddling small knobs . ( Update ) The software works well & useful . It loaded right problem . instructions lot easier I start using pedal often . That 's problem many features squeezed small pedal . More worth though . Very fun use.Comes power supply.Very easy control.I enjoy using play alone - It easy lay rhythm play it.It used drum tracks practice section song want repeat . I got thing learned basics looping ( I 've done two jams far ) I already tell 's amazing tool serious guitarist . The reviewer PA hit nail head comment 's `` playing guitar twice much getting twice good '' - 's great compliment pedal I agree 100 % . What I especially like pedal feels like `` missing link '' collection gear brings together . I 'm using guitar , mixer , bass , drum machine , monitors whereas recording seemed like bit chore - thing really puts FUN back playing . I think one piece equipment really bring creativity I ca n't wait see I come , new `` band '' : - ) I used Line 6 looper past 6 JM4 Looper . The Line6 basically electronics amplifier . It 's decent looper , 's big I n't need guitar tones , backing tracks , etc. , go I decided look wanted looper I could fit onto pedal board could provide basic functionality ( multiple channels , etc . ) one fit bill . You adjust loop volume , switch quickly tracks , turn background percussion ( ) , etc . I purchased extra foot switch little control switching tracks.The fault I 've found thus far foot switch cable DigiTech includes switch straight input instead 90 degree . This weird , pedals board need 90 degree connection cable sticking next pedal . To solve , I bought Hosa 90 degree stereo connector ( stereo ) RT . . . 1/4 '' PHONE ( F ) - STEREO 1/4 '' PHONE ( M ) . I 've added photo JamMan board find full photo board look thePedaltrain MINI With Soft great attribute pedal 's built solid easy stomp ( n't perfect aim , good timing ) . There strange nuances , though . For example , step pedal twice hold clear current track . This gets track started clears . Not good using performance . However , workarounds ( like switching tracks ) . Overall - great deal price , looking improve lead , I would certainly recommend pedal like one .

844	I bought teen son Christmas . He loves play bass sing along . He different Shure mic totally flat compared particular model . Nice clean sounds , plus seems pretty sturdy . We get mic stand fits perfectly stays put . Shure knocked one park . preferred mics practice gigs ... around tough mic ... needs ... I highly recommend them.. The industry standard live performance , SM58 withstood test time good reason . These microphones I perform , on/off switch makes easier I n't power gear I done practicing ... I turn mic . It bad mic price ( If want real good one studio quality mic would cost 600 bucks ) comparison studio mic since I worked recording studio . Now , need decide want , getting studio mic alone give result looking ; like HD TV player playing ordinary CD . You would compliment mic many products like studio quality mixer , speakers . If home hobby user , go mic . This mic quite good price . I would probably say , exceeds promised frustration free packing . Also , make sure buy foam mic hood mic save unwanted dirt spit.The reason I give 5 stars , mine little dent body ( may due transportation ) nothing function looks . How review SM58 ? ? I 've used life , continue . Very durable , I got replace , 20 year old , rusted / dented grill 58 : ) I also use D5 ( AKG - price ) line 6 wirelesss , 58 always reliable first choice backup . The first rule microphones , `` No one microphone perfect every purpose . '' Rule two , `` Experiment different mics different applications find signature sound . '' I 've used Shure SM58 's along relatives back 1968 . I primarily used broadcasting recording spoken word content I used ( still use ) singing back vocals.The SM58 one thing well vocal performance used close mouth public address use . Some people , included , actually sound better comfortable live performance setting using another mic , Shure SM-57 . The SM-58 good vocal mic people probably best choice . For example , anyone resist putting mic right lips singing probably want SM-58 . People softer weaker voices want SM-58 highly directional noticeable yet manageable proximity effect ( means bass increases closer get . ) This mic pick well much 8 inches away . The reason many singers think supposed shove microphones practically inside mouth ball type Shure vocal mics require get close n't sound right . On hand , SM-57 sounds best several inches away user 's mouth works fine 12 inches away . While SM-58 certainly number one professional PA vocal mic , precious uses colored sound prominent frequency response boost upper midrange plus sound source close picked clearly . It works ok drums like , SM-58 last thing 'd want use mic sax guitar . Personally mics best mic technique basic nature voice , people sound great . The live vocal mic works best Shure SM-57 windscreen . However people SM-58 works better . It depends voice want mic . If deep voice , SM-58 might second best choice SM-57 better low frequency response.One certain advantage SM-58 excellent gain feedback capability . This mic turned louder almost mic without annoying PA squeal . Another advantage SM-58 still available ( slight extra cost ) built-in on/off switch . The SM-58 's ball shaped sturdy even dent one get replacement screws right ten dollars . I 've seen SM-58 's dented , rusty , dusty , smoked , spit , pieces missing slammed hardwood stage full weight boom stand adding mass fall yet I 've never seen one stop working malfunction due on/off switch got dirt it.All pro-line Shure mics top quality . The pro line Shures also hold value well . If buy one decide n't like , get paid eBay . I would compare many mics possible buying one . 's mics sound really good worth look . The SM-58 number one on-stage vocal mic foreseeable future people follow crowd instead actually trying different mics picking one works best particular voice . These things durable even stopped making today 'd still around another 20 years least . legendary performance indeed ! works perfectly , extremely easy set , good sound , good price , 's 'bout need know ! Great around mic used vocals . No frills , tough nails , great sound live music . If 're buying first mic ( switching cheapie ) intend use singing/vocals , mic musician would probably recommend without hesitation . I 've never used another one since first time I switched cheaper mic ( came bundle ) 10 years ago . I depend smoothness vocals carry songs mic reproduces warm sounds I like perfectly . You stand 3 feet away really wail , get close bass response , anything comes mic , cable , cable tie , carry pouch , mic clip . The standard SM58 switch ( one less thing break I n't miss ) dollars extra . I 've got Shure SM58 expected , real workhorse microphones ; sound clear , crispy , robust , high quality product.Also , I 've bought Amazon sold J & R ; Music Computer World excellent supplier . They shipped less time expected.I 'm really happy customer . complaints ! quality great ! sounds excellent ! voice sounds wonderful crisp . use time . A nice addition recording home studio ! I recommend one records ballads light classical music . This mic works better people others . That said first mic I put lead singers hand upon meeting . If n't sound good I try something else . I complaints GO TO MIC . I bought two microphones , AKG D5 SM58 . I like AKG D5 little better vocal sounded lot clearer crisp SM sounded muted compared D5 without sound modification box . The output also little less sensitive I like look SM58 seems extremely durable . In words John used hawking watches early days live television , Shure SM58 Vocal mic fits perfectly I found career film television sound recordist mixer , I played rock bands live sound mixing . One first mics truly fell love SM58 . Shure Brothers Company 1966 , SM58 quickly rose become industry standard rugged road mics actually sound good ear nearly mic capsule ( heart shaped ) design helps reject sound either side . There bump 's frequency helps vocals cut stage noise . Construction rugged , frequency response 50 Hz , capsule sits internally foam shock mount help isolate handling used joke SM58 needed hammer could n't find one , grab one , tough . I 've seen road could n't believe still worked , sounded great.The cage style pop screen gives SM58 's distinctive look , one influenced many mic brands day introduced , 's part functionality . lined layer acoustic foam , cage helps keep vocals pops getting dynamic mic element . As frame reference , theShure Shure SM57 Cardioid Dynamic exact mic capsule , without pop screen.Shure also sells Performer series mic , theShure Beta 58A Dynamic Microphonethat looks almost identical SM58 uses totally different mic capsule transformer different sound try Shure SM58 still considered industry standard live performance mics today price , really good deal . I made mistake thinking I could save forty bucks get Shure PG-58 . I 'm vocalist occasionally need announcements accommodate guest vocalist instrument amp ( rather P.A. ) . Whatever reason , PG-58 simply n't sufficient gain oomph much use Roland Cube / Peavey amps I try employ ( I use 1/4 '' adapter XLR connector comes mic ) . When I borrow Shure SM-58 mic someone , difference instant dramatic -- 's far efficient ( i.e . louder ) mic , producing full , clear sound , without additional pre-amplification , 's popular microphone world . For five bucks extra , I ca n't reason avoiding , version on-off switch . It 's small price pay quick solutions feedback unwanted pick-up `` private '' comments band members . And even 're instrumentalist , may wiser select SM-58 SM-57 . The former mic little , 's also slightly adaptable , screen filter certain amount wind noise unwanted non-musical sounds . Above , SM-58 proven tank microphones , simply unparalleled ruggedness durability . [ I see review consumer wary `` seller . '' Perhaps good point unless 's reference Amazon Prime , Shure SM-58 : competitive prices , postage , easy returns . But anyone returns SM58 probably business buying first place . They populous industry , purchased professionals know first-hand 're getting -- reliability virtual . In fact , 's popularity SM58 led slightly less expensive . require choice , Shure SM58 need none . ] There plenty flashier - prettier - looking looking microphones . Its much marketing garbage . These mics best mic buck . Anyone claims able tell difference far expensive ones blowing smoke . The mic well made ( heavy & # 34 ; mic & # 34 ; end ) , I yet try pop filter multi-track studio .

I wanted something dress slow ballads , course `` On The Bayou '' . This pedal goes nice subtle background effect deep depth want . And variance guitar tone volume click . I play lot acoustic solo really nice addition change sound . Sure Tremolo pedals , I 've always fan Boss TR-2 .

This tremelo pedal works nicely 's great 're playing amp without tremelo . Problem solved ! The price also good .

I three units capable tremolo : Boss TR-2 , Line 6 MM4 , Boss ( like tremolo steroids ) . Plus amp Twin Reverb tremolo . If unfamiliar , tremolo volume turning rapidly.The Boss TR-2 simplest three stompboxes operate , three controls : `` Rate '' modulation , `` Depth '' modulation ( much volume vary ) , `` Wave '' shape ( jagged , square , somewhere continuum ) . Unlike Boss stompboxes I ( CE-5 & PH-3 ) , TR-2 seem compress sound seems like 're `` playing fishbowl '' ( another reviewer puts ) .The `` Wave '' control gives unit sonic versatility , nice feature . Most tremolos , . For price , give decent set classic tremolo sounds nothing crazy . It unit Tom Morello uses `` Radio , '' well tremolo classics like `` How Soon Is Now ? '' I hear volume drop problem like reviews suggest , something I sensitive I generally turn modulations on/off course song rather leave full time.Like Boss stuff , box sturdy I like big , quiet footswitches little , clicky ones units . The color sort dull military dark green , attractive thing bad small Boss effects come power cable , factor cost . Boss instructions tell need particular adapter , I n't know anyone says must . I run pedalboard power supply seems work fine . If n't I would buy Boss product Line : ( 1 ) Gives decent array basic tremolo sounds , nothing crazy ( 2 ) Not bad price ( factor power cable ) ( 3 ) Simple operate ( 4 ) Nice casing footswitch ; color

850	This pedal exactly tune string quickly . It good purchase . I recomend . Actually planning buy Boss TU-2 Boss TU-3 found one , 2 mins reading specification knew one superior GET THIS 90 $ ever spend . I wrote nasty review tuner back , blasting performance compared competitors : Korg Pitch Black Boss TU-3 . I still least , I tuner years . Stock tuner awful . While attractive compact , single note tuning , needle fast stable competitors , polyphonic mode n't accurate enough either . Moreover , display n't visible Pitch Black TU-3 sunlight . So tuner great want something looks nice n't take space pedal board , stock n't truly great tuner.However , firmware update . After applying latest updates , tuner become usable . The polyphonic mode still quite good enough rely 100 % , single note mode seems accurate tuner price range . So small , attractive tuner w/ true bypass actually works . So I changed review 2 5 stars . Also , given price dropped sharply since I bought tuner , much better bang yeah , buy product confidence , purchased used old , make sure firmware date . Without update , tuner borderline terrible . With update , 's good enough tuner primary stage pedalboard . And fact , , held regular practices gigs . I found inaccurate strings , adjustment possible . I bought newer features & I like strum & see strings function good nice features main function tuner inaccurate ! It 's bad tuner , seems well built unless play poorly loud tuning precision n't matter I 'd go Korg Pitch Black ( I using home studio - well back worked ! ) Cool tuner , I pedal board works really well , easy seeand true bypass nice n't ... . I bought pedal looking Boss TU-3 Korg Pitch Black bass . This pedal mini version bass mode . Strumming 4 5 strings works well quick tune , I still use chromatic function get exact tune . The accuracy impressive pedal even worked well low read bass forums reviews tuner thought try . TC electronics seems spend alot time advertising products bass mags online products greatly IMO , pedal reviews speak themselves.I able tune electric acoustic guitar seconds using sweep option even tried cigar box guitar reading AD & G ; strings worked pedal easy use switching tuning modes breeze . I chose keep clear film display preserve display long I . I tested sweep option old Ibanez guitar n't played years even old strings , I got reasonable tune strings seems work better guitar bass , many reviews bass mags online also point although works quick tune.I happy pedal hope lasts long old Boss TU-2 . I feel changed tuning needs breeze . I like pedal . It 's totally silent , bright display , sensitive meter . In fact , complaint I strum-every-string-at-once thing n't useful might think . Not I ever use . I 'd buy product I . This great little tuner guitar . Love fact tune 6 strings time Wow , I 'm really impressed tuner . Strumming strings gives quick overview strings tune tune string automatically switches chromatic mode . It 's quick , 's accurate , works ... ... WELL ! ! ! This tuner wonderful . You tune strings time . It 's stage , n't need test string individually . I like tuner I 'm definitely keeping , `` polyphonic '' aspect pretty useless . When tune using needle ( LED version needle ) , show string tune . Then strum use polyphonic mode , often shows strings ! And 's even I use neck pick strum thumb , manual says . But tuner works great single string mode , I also like drop D setting easy way switch 2 modes . It also cool easy ways adjust 440 Hz pitch , easy switch Eb tunings settings . I also like LED lights automatic brightness setting . That cool feature folks still use batteries power pedals . The tuner works great , saving grace kinda gimmicky sales pitch regarding polyphonic setting . So buy , price right works great tuner traditional sense , polyphonic gimmick . ( August 2013 edit follows ) I found feature pedal I definitely NOT like ! ! I dislike much , I edit review . I wanted hear licks sounded E flat . So I set tuner E flat setting explained manual , I tried tune . All strings kept showing still standard tuning . It seems drop settings tuner functioning . I wrote manufacturer ( get back quickly ) explained drop tuning functions ONLY WORK polytune mode ! ! So 're like , find polytune n't work well , basically standard needle chromatic tuner tune drop modes ! ! ! 
851	I bought USA Fender product replace piece junk . often threads 1/4 inch . It fit perfectly jack socket threads . Quick install , works like dream . This exactly I expecting . Seems better quality cheaper products I researched . I 'd definitely recommend paying little bit extra money better quality Fender product like generic output jacks . Es el output original de que se puede producto de gusto ! Saludos todos desde Venezuela ! ! This genuine Fender Switchcraft brand input jack . It bit bigger width wise import copies , 's easy using copy strat . It works perfectly . Great price seller well . If want sturdy jack , good gets . Just good ol ' genuine Fender parts . Nothing complain . I 'm stickler OEM parts I typically Fender stuff . next nothing part , saved day side project friend . Thank God I buy spares . simple admittedly cheap little part enabled finish project quickly . It n't get , I soldered 's fine . Not real heavy usage anyway . Great product , little soldering knowledge ( really basic fact ) , fix noisy jack time . Nice snug American Stage Cables ( D'Addario great ! Hey , R. uses ) . Great price , much less local music shop asks . Great output Jack , love one much durable . Works fine guitar . Try one . 
852	I gibson les paul I bought used . When arrived fretboard good shape , dry . I first tried lemon oil would work , week fretboard would feel dry color ( rosewood ) . So I started looking another solution found Gerlitz Guitar ordered applied . A hours later I restrung guitar started playing n't care way fretboard felt . I think guitar honey little thicker lemon oil felt little slimy n't completely dry . I decided give another 24 hours.The next day guitar neck looked played great . It darker color untreated rosewood fretboards plays like champ . Bends slides smoother product one I continue use . If need quick treatment gig something , I would recommend lemon oil dries quickly . But I would use every regular maintenance situation . This treatment , I let soak 24 hours , made fingerboard look great play fast . A little goes long way ! As I mentioned review guitar polish ( already forgot kind ) , I 'm really guitar polish connoisseur , makes fingerboards feel real good . It got rid scratchy feeling I bent strings , crud , makes fretboard look lovely . It probably works fine hand conditioner , say . Again , I 'm rather slack guitar maintenance thing , bottle also last years . I used fretboards electrics acoustics . It easy clean left wood feeling soft polished without slick feeling oils . Highly recommended Works advertised . Makes fretboard look feel nice ! I imagine stuff last quite long time well since really use 're changing strings . I use fretboard new Hohner wc03 two Epiphone Acoustics . They factory . Keeps wood smooth beautiful much longer weeks . I use every time I restring guitars , It really good product , I use guitars , except Strat maple I bought use older acoustic guitar neck bit faded 2 uses , wood looks great . I used honey twice 2 days brought back maple wood like new honey works fast well make playing fingerboard alot easier . I saw local shop price minus shipping I bought , I use much last long time . I bought guitar sitting guys closet longest time , fret board dry colorless . I used , color became rich less dry . If fret board pretty dry , DO NOT remove oil . Let sit overnight remove towel . Leave longer depending dry fret board . I love n't leave oily residue n't smell stands . I n't even notice smell . I definitely would say must-have . I requested Christmas 2011 pleased get . I 've used least 7 guitars works great . First I used treat clean fingerboards good shape worked well . It even make big improvement dry , porous surface cheap fretboard , good rosewood fingerboards love stuff.Later I got used guitars used cleaned fingerboards Guitar Honey ( apply , scrub toothbrush , wipe paper towel , repeat ) lot better I expected removing yucky buildup next like apply fairly heavily lay guitar fingerboard level facing , give time soak . You notice areas soak others . I move around fretboard soaks evenly . Then wipe excess paper towel 're ready I wipe strings playing first time two treating Guitar Honey , rag shows dark lines Guitar Honey cleaned strings . I like making strings last longer ! Get . I n't think 'll regret . I lot high end instruments , I live New England proper fretboard care must - especially ebony woods prone cracking stuff fantastic - MUCH better lemon oil , dries lot cleaner n't leave oily residue board . An hour 's applied sets n't get hands . I apply occasion strings ( I use Elixirs ) never problem.The best bucks 'll spend guitar care . 5 Stars . This stuff great . Leaves board clean fast . No residue , sticky oil film . Price right . If use fingerboard treatment , try one ... 
853	I use different kinds picks , one special , strings rings really pleasant , great speed picking ! As beginner guitarist , friends let try picks . I displeased standard picks , partially I n't like flimsy feel sound n't sound quite robust I like ( hopefully , makes sense ) . However , I handed one , produced pleasant sound I n't feel like I would somehow break pick playing.Needless say , I guitar , I ordered pack I certainly disappointed . I 've playing guitar entire life . And I 've tried almost every pick . After hearing great , I decided buy . It felt really small first , kinda dissapointed . I put , n't use quite time . For reason decided pick back , minutes came like pick . Days using , got accustomed size , I became much efficient picking . And I longer worry pick slipping . I ca n't really go back normal sized picks now.. haha . That 's like downside I think . There many versions style , buy em , try em . If n't work , always buy . Real nice Guitar Picks . It came 6 piece pack , deserve Dunlop things last long time . 's kinda small hand works great ! 's easier pick string . This pack comes 6 picks . I 've using even since trying , wonderful picks speed precision , wo n't go back sure . These shred picks , accurate . harmonics come easily . The point made scream wound strings , , breeze . I gave one guitarist band uses . I recently bought packs Jazz IIIs I shocked . They n't play like I expecting . Under high edge n't look old Jazz III either , n't play turn ! ! ! What 's ? I 'm sorry give poor review great brand like Dunlop . Let 's hope short-term fluke . I love picks . Great lead playing , small fingers like I , feel great ! Nice quality pick . After use large , flimsy old school picks used n't one babies available . These best picks . If n't already better purchase . Black Red , color difference . I like pick well . It 's third color pick I purchased . I probably always use . let people know bat tell picks small , used big picks might turn . But trust say get used picks start using proper technique picks improve technique rapidly.i never thought would say pick helped improve playing . try bigger pick even use picks skill picks . trust put picks get used improve least many people agree . : D Give picks three days you'llNever go back another style.Almost impossible slip fingers , great tone , amazing clarity , effortless harmonics , durable pick literally makes play better ! 
854	Unlike reviewers I found quality issues mine , came symmetrically bent plastic pad n't smell like anything , holds harp exactly needs easy enough remove , I need loosen bottom wingnut , rotate harp away mouth , lift frame change harps bite harp , use hands depress tabs either side pull head back sliding harp , insert new one place harp mouth , depress tabs use mouth center harp plates , position release tabs making sure get lips caught harmonica plates pinch shut . The harmonica barely fits holder , adjustment distance mouth harmonica . I ca n't get harmonica adjusted close enough play , unless I modify . worx// say ? welp ... thing say like thin brass slip washer lock washers adjustment wingnutsand 'd perfect ! ! ! ( nope ... still havent found washers size stash im hunt : n sistas ! Doc P . I wish fine adjustment orient harp mouth . I feel I angle head use harmonica matter I set . I big neck prominent armature extend far I think I need - causing position harmonica angle awkward . angle right would mouth ( LOL ) .This least expensive holder I could find Nov 2013 . Since inexpensive comparatively I use vice bend suit grand nephews n't want it.Also sure n't make wider accommodate larger variety strong spring action holding harmonica place , could easily hold much larger longer harmonica designed . 5 star mechanism 4 star armature design . I ordered one Lee Oskar . I could n't find usable position either ready return noticed shoulder piece Hohner & # 34 ; raised & # 34 ; ends . I reversed piece ends angle instead works ok . The quality appears good . The springs hold harp holding harp mouth using hands I change harps without removing rack.This first shoulder rack I n't know expect . I adjusted exactly right able go harp singing 's challenging I get done . This holder , every holder I 've ever bought , n't hold harmonica right angle . They need one joint adjust angle . I 've Hohner racks I prepared . I use harmonica holders . This one decent spring may require use duct tape wire hold kazoo place . I may add wire tape kazoo aesthetic . The angle kazoo use everyone 's head neck mine . This holder may work well harmonica people . If , try holders buy . I prefer design fitted hold exact size diatonic compared style made fit size . Great quality , lasts forever . You wo n't dissapointed . Great harmonica rack , smaller harps . Very strong set worn . A must folk player . This first time I ventured world figured easy pretty sure too.Fast shipping , Amazon I bought lieu expensive Lee Oskar rack . I 'm regular rack player wanted something experiment . This rack constructed better I really expected . It 's easy adjust . However , I found fit around neck angle harmonica bit awkward . Getting harmonica unto te spring-loaded holder bit tricky . Still , good deal . This excellent product . I 've used one , n't remember lock washers ... . When tighten , actually stays tightened.For $ 10 go wrong . Bear mind 's standard 10 hole diatonic harmonica , 16 hole chromatic style . In case 're wondering difference Hohner harmonica holder Hohners costing twice one 's price , one made China others made Germany . Now , I 'm definitely one automatically dismiss quality Chinese made products . I , fact , many musical items surprisingly good quality made . This item however good , AND stereotypical problems Chinese goods . Pros : Cheap . Sturdy . And unlike reviewers , I love taller height . Far far better ergonomically stoop scrunch neck windpipe . I also like tighter springs , though take little getting used . But secure feel harp worth slight extra effort . Now , Cons : It 's true others said : plastic neck tube smells . Not bad said , annoying chemical smell definitely noticeable . I cut got big wide replacement tube buck ( make sure one get wide enough slide bends neck loop bar thingee - I got 1/2 '' diameter ) . 2nd perhaps bigger problem metal NOT bent evenly . Mine distinctly taller one side , neck loop WAY . I best bend parts even , flat metal part tough shape . The reason I n't return I figure equally uneven : I picture bunch poor souls slaving away bending suckers hand , little machine help ensure consistency . With work I , works fine fairly even , like I said , taller height right . It 's annoying basic expectations n't met ( like holding harmonica even height sides ) . All said , bottom line I prefer using OVER German made Hohner holder 's better ergonomically ( taller ) , holds harp securely , traditional dual butterfly nut design works far better less effort `` '' single butterfly nut design expensive German Hohner . Knowing I know drawbacks , I 'm still tempted pick another back-up spare . It 's great deal 're willing little work . This good neck rack gigging ... It DOES take little tweaking customizing get arranged right around goes neck racks really ... Once 's fit though , It works beautifully ! I use mine daily n't failed yet ! Also , ( little ) Hold , slide whistle , . `` nose flute '' ( I `` one man band '' act sometimes ... ) 
855	I love cable . I n't get buzz I hook bass handle anything I throw . The sound quality amazing . Hands best cable I ever owned . I spending money cheaper cables continuously I spend money stuff . I play one five hours day used cable 3 4 months . Well worth money . Lifetime guarantee boot . Definitely buy Mogami . Yes , paying little extra peace mind reputation Mogami gold quality . I found good investment meticulous sound . Compared old cable , Mogami Gold produced transparent sound ... might side side comparison get idea . When recording guitar , I able clearly hear individual strings playing overdriven chords . No matter playing style , cable work well sound . bought cable emergency situation - one I road , needed great cable , n't access roll using , would 've , essentially parts . I exclusively use canare mogami studio , critical places live setup . The cable top shelf , quiet , provide years use treat even modest respect . As instrument cable , could possibly little short move around bunch , making worth go 18 ' cable bass guitar player n't like tied . I used part keyboard rig , perfect levels - quality reproduction sound across entire spectrum ( highs crystal , bass clear ) , connection solid ( I gold fanatic , excellent ) , great warranty , reputation holds value . ( These real deal pro cables , opposed cables priced similarly monster price , necessarily superior build sound , I n't walk guitar center buy pair monster 1000 's waited delivered overnight instead , , , ) What say . If 're looking cable , must knowledge tone loss . Simple , want studio quality cable gives top notch tone signal , buy Mogami . I owned hundreds cables nothing price range touches Mogami . Sure buy expensive Plus Pro Evidence Audio cables . But NOT hear difference . Lifetime warranty wo n't replacing time soon . Works flawlessly live situations studio . All I Mogami cables . Check silent plug guitar cable cord . pops noise . 
856	The Behringer good looking , great sounding amp small package , used low medium volume . At higher volumes one take care equalizer reduce bass midrange , also use button , avoid `` muddy '' sound much ( distorted ? ) bass . This amp play loudly , rather volume accompaniment smaller venue.As sound effects , great 16 effects covering reverb , chorus , delay/echo many combinations . I especially like effects totally different settings either channel . Also nice separate XLR microphone input channel input good backgrounds ( maybe drum machine ) playing , music breaks , although one needs cable RCA plugs connect . Lack headphone jack drawback , balanced good things little amp , great sounding flexible amp low price , n't plan crank much ! I using Behringer six months . I impressed early , still satisfied performance . It straight forward 2 channel acoustic amp modest effects . One would filling large venue need quality amp provide . I 'm running preamps Gibson Taylor ce sound amazing I n't even know rest gain . The music instruments clear , bright , deep sound great reproduction instruments . Behringer 's mission statement provide quality amplification musicians reasonable price . I say , `` mission accomplished '' . Amazon seamless work free fast shipping whole experience great . Man , get things cool easy . Push couple buttons magic appears doorstep . Great amp instructions minimal pretty worthless . Unless mixer , use one instrument one microphone . Really puts sound though , I guess 's get amp ! I used gym turn gain 2-3 fill place . Very nice effects channels . I happy amp . I 've close year sounds amazing . On couple occasions , I plugged acoustic , mic , buddies mic , still handled load sounded good . I 'm impressed . I even Digitech pedal I use Fender Strat , sounds amazing . I highly recommend amp . This amp sounds great , looks great , works great breath fresh air & # 34 ; modelling & # 34 ; amps ones many effects require regular use manual cycle . This Behringer dial offering four effects styles five & # 34 ; flavor & # 34 ; settings . They one dial pushing , pullling holding seconds lights tell 've switched gears . Here turn dial one little click time find sound twenty . There simple level knob intensity effect great thing foot switch included stomp button effects return clean acoustic guitar . The foot switch second button channel accommodate another guitar , microphone singing , drum machine . The EQ sliders quality give nice reference distance whereas knobs 'd right see set . I 've problem front cover others mentioned -- 's velcroed fine . The cabinet covered nice brown material . Plenty loud . 
857	I think guitarists always new things picks easy cheap thing try . My favorite picks last ~8 years Snarling Dogs Brain Picks - 're nylon picks raspy `` cat 's tongue '' surface makes super easy 've also Gator Grip picks years I like quite bit , 're favorite . I tend use something around 1 mm electric bit less acoustic . These picks matte finish makes easy retain grip . Sound-wise I n't find 're significantly different pick . If ever stop making Brain Picks could well become # 1 . I 've using Dunlop Delrin 500 2.0 picks . Purple ones turtle/500 . I thought I found pick . Because slippery , I rough side enough texture improve grip ( I 'd rub flat side edge honing stone ) . At music store I stumbled Dunlop Gator Grip 2.0 . Yes offer better grip ( I think 're still little slippery much better Delrin 500 ) . But since I solved problem honing stone , I curious . So - , better , grip wise , I surprised difference tone . They give much mellower tone 500s since I 'm using flat wound 12s archtop - less bright sound often better tone overall . 500s seem harder material brighter . I n't know made I like difference sound . I 'm sure 'd work round wound strings - great jazz tones . Smooth sound attack . Grips soft , loose , yet well . I HUNDREDS picks . These favorites . I 've playing 30 years . There lot great products I 've tried lot . I say feel tone grey Dunlop 2mm picks surpasses Dunlop yellow , Fender 351 , Golden Gate Dawg mandolin picks . This opinion , I hope 'll check I 'm sure wo n't disappointed ! It 's pick ... everyone preference , I happen like 1.14 's lot & # 34 ; powder-y & # 34 ; grip real bonus . It take bit wear still good & # 34 ; clean & # 34 ; well . I use 1.5 mm Dunlop Gator Grip twenty years . The non-slip surface n't take long wear , I work-around . I 've even put vice , filed new points . I prefer extra heavy pick 's delay pick . You ca n't go wrong picks enjoy full size pick . They better grip full sound ( ears ) Tortex picks . I since went Jazz picks picks solid product . This pick great strumming . Some people complaining grip better celluloid picks regard . If looking best grip need find pick textured grip . Since named & # 34 ; Gator Grip & # 34 ; I expected good gripping surface . That case . The entire material holding surface material . Also n't large I expected . They still usable decent picks . I 'm glad I tried , I wont order . I thought might good alternate Dunlop nylon picks , really though.Edit : Im nothing fair . My last review context playing Strat sometimes 335 . I stand review . However , Im playing Godin 5th suddenly picks perfect . Ive gone back forth trying different picks guitars . In end picks I reach Im playing buy . I changing review 'Just Okay ' `` Perfect '' . Ok I 'll add star , right I add star . There ! These favorite pick years , I must say real pointy I recently trying pointier pick I 'm fence ... I started lot fingerstyle guitar playing , seems made fingertips slick . So I hard time holding picks ( I use ) upstrokes . I 'm sure I could improve technique fix problem , 's fun blame pick ! These picks different picks without & # 34 ; gator grip & # 34 ; IMHO . But Gorilla worked beautifully . I 've trying find pick combines good grip , right string resonance strumming , enough stiffness accurate picking picks might closest I 've found far style playing . I 'm naturally hard strummer I want pick I hold loosely , strum softly , still get enough clarity volume . I want give 5 stars I think would apply perfect strumming picking - 're good quite I would consider ideal pick one exists . If I perfectly satisfied picks I would never buy picks . For preferred picks I keep experimenting brands types picks search elusive ideal .

Black tolex outside thin looks okay . This NOT case take road travel air adequate casual use . Only annoying thing : case arrived locked . The keys , course , inside case . Dumb . A friend music store used key another Guardian case unlock . A good reminder case latch lock keep latch popping open NOT keep . Great quality , nice interior , fits Yamaha F335 perfectly . Solid steardy case last long time . fav cases ever

I Voodoo Lab Pedal Power 2 documentation comes pedalboard specifically states power supply mounts board , even includes mounting brackets fit power supply . However , actually try mount underside board suggested , 're unpleasant surprise.First , regarding two circular holes front board . The power supply ... sort . There 's way align perfectly holes pedaltrain 2 slightly close together . I n't worried , since I doubt I 'll ever chain access 1 outlet.The second issue , self-tapping screws come mounting kit strip though made butter . Once 've got ( attempted ) , 're never coming . You 'll probably break . It 's shame cut corners something main issue I board relating Voodoo Lab power supply . Once get power supply mounted properly underside board ( go one place ) , begin plug pedals discover cables supplied power supply n't fit mounting location board . You ca n't plug 's enough clearance frame pedalboard sockets cables plug to.I really bought pedalboard supposed perfect compatibility Voodoo Lab power supply I , given n't fit like 's supposed , I wish I could return board - except I ca n't , holes drilled . ( You drill board mount power supply underneath . ) Basically , I paid $ 100 plain flat sheet metal metal rectangle couple rolls velcro . Needless say , I 'm pleased .

You lot pedals including big ones volume/wah pedals . Read description sense size . quality nice , solid resistible . The soft case nice also .

The SKB well built board , Pedaltrain boards simply best functional design available , period ! ! And designing Voodoo Lab Pedal Power mind stroke genius . brackets mount ... ... another brilliant stroke . This no-brainer . This best option top flight pedalboard . Great job !

The tuners fit perfectly modification whatsoever . They also feel sturdy ones I replaced . It 's hard say keep tune better point I n't long enough - better , though , B string old tuners used always go flat quickly.I decided use old screws instead new ones shipped Grovers - fit better ( i.e . tighter ) . Nothing wrong new screws , I like stuff snug . : ) I like glad I purchased - far . I installed Epiphone Les Paul . They provide VERY noticeable upgrade provide true vintage look . I tune much finer precision , hold tuning even bending . The ability accurately tune keep tuning allows play sound better . I note I drill new holes , precisely , enlarge holes guitar . I used 3/8 drill bit went slowly carefully . I 'm sure idea drilling guitar might sound scary , actually quite easy . Now nice snug since I made holes bit tight . 
869	I bought practice amp bass guitar . It showed amazon I search `` Bass Guitar amps '' , regular guitar amps showing I curious . After bit searching online see guitar amp would work practice situations , I thought I would give try people say yes , others said . I wanted test . While I get sound able practice , n't anywhere close tone I hoping . So I ended returning next day . I 'm upset amp , shows bass amp search , reason I gave shot . For regular guitar , would fine bass . I would take bass key words whatever trigger show . I market practice amp $ 100 hopeful , I ended buying used Acoustic Bass Combo Amp price new practice amp I lot satisfied . Again , review strictly aspect bass guitar , regular guitar .

870	A must Yamaha . You plug ti instead using 100 batteries . That keeps weight tremendously long yo plug youa good go . Good power supply cheaper Yamaha keyboards . I never understood Yamaha keyboards n't come power supply ? So , I found suitable power supply instrument works fine . No problems.Do n't buy one store , cheaper . Be patient get one . If buy keyboard 're going need power adaptor . Yamaha runs scam supplying power cord making buy separate I suppose nickle really add . Power cord fine . Yamaha shady .

872	Does job removing dust records without harming . The handle folds use protect bristles . Over nice product . This brush used remove static electricity light dust records playing . This deep cleaning , dust dirt removal brush ; compliment record cleaning solutions like excellent liquid cleaner Last ( LAST PC Power Cleaner 3/4 . ) .The brush super simple use , album turntable , hold roughly ninety degree angle two revolutions , sweep LP . No fuss , muss , fooling around . Never touch carbon fiber fingers . When visible dust fibers , give brush good flick rotating handle across fibers . After use , rotate handle around cover fibers . If press brush hard album , deep dive sharp angle trick , fibers broken brush . Just press lightly rotating LP , sweep brush LP , wonderful brush sold many different brand names , , , brush comes instructions use , odd omission . Maybe assumption brush easy use , instructions would redundant.Audiophile , brush must anyone still loves analog recordings . This great addition stereo system today , assuming still use turntable . Two passes brush clean records get ready play , free annoying pops clicks . It wo n't save dirty record , 'll buy cleaning solution , brush easily take care dust , hair , get attracted LPs regular use . As another reviewer suggested , I first pass brush going record , I spreading paint something like , gets surface free . The second pass brush going directly motion record , cleans dust inside grooves record . After , record sound brand new ! There definitely cleaning maintenance options , none easy cheap . The version I picked came grounding wire , claiming using wire conjunction brush would snap , crackles , pops . If believe , continue , maybe 'll imagine less surface noise case device . Speaking pragmatically , I 've found use item loose , conspicuous collected surface vinyl disc . Seems get bit dust surface record , frankly , old type fluid much better job . Better yet clean records well warm water dish soap ( new paint brush ) , rinse well dry clean micro fiber cloth . Just try get labels wet . This everything need record brush . The bristles perfect quality softness get dust sits lines record . Highly recommended !

876	I 'm satisfied performance CM-2 . With tweaking , I could emulate sound I get Fulltone OCD . I 'd say 's versatile two seperate controls low & high frequencies unlike pedals `` Tone '' control . A toggle switch lets choose `` classic '' & `` modified '' setting . A tweaker 's delight ! The `` level '' knob lot juice . If set 10 11 o'clock , 's plenty loud enough . Although ca n't use clean boost gives little gain even set `` gain '' knob zero . If single coil , may sound like tube amp breaking , humbuckers ( much gain ) . You also stack CM-2 pedals . I dusted old Boss DS-1 run along CM-2 able get good tones . The DS-1 usually hurts ears CM-2 behind , sweet ! The Hardwire CM-2 may exotic boutique offerings Klon , LovePedal , get job done significantly lower cost . It 's well built , take pounding gigging musician subject . There may others better cost twice price twice good . Try , ca n't go wrong ! UPDATE : Did full comparison CM-2 , Fulltone OCD & Joyo Crunch : Joyo obviously gain followed closely CM-2 OCD , : The CM-2 amount control separate high & low controls , followed OCD tone control Joyo Crunch less sounds matter position put tone control . Since CM-2 widest tone range , I make behave like Treble Booster ! : The OCD cleans well roll volume control guitar dynamic . The CM-2 close second Joyo Crunch , strictly distortion pedal far behind . First , I n't like distortion pedals instead making Fender Blues DeVille 410 sound distorted , make sound like amplifying distorted pedal . There 's difference . Think n't get , I n't like lot pedals . I play rock/country band play music sounds like Neil Young , Tom Petty , , etc . Just simple clean rock roll mix chords occasional minor 6th . I want overdrive ( Digitech Bad Monkey ) Arion tuner , I need distortion covers , AC/DC , Hendrix , etc . ( The DeVille Hendrix , turn 7 . But course 's loud . ) Based criteria , DigiTech CM-2 PERFECT . The Classic `` overdrive '' setting allows sound like Hendrix rocking Neil Young ( rock band 60s 70s ) . The Modern setting allows sound like 80s 90s rock , e.g. , Guns ' n Roses important , settings make amp sound like IT overdriven . It sounds like tubes pushed breaking point . It sounds awesome . It sound like amplified I use Bad Monkey ( I 've reviewed Amazon want read ) boosting clean sound . I use CM-2 I want play dirtier covers . Two pedals ( plus tuner ) I play everything I want . I 'm happy . If 're anything like , I know 're thinking : Digital , junk . Not anymore . The Digitech HardWire CM-2 finishes Digitech began Bad Monkey , great overdrive pedal right . But CM-2 offers tone quality compares best market ( pedal , I 've owned wayyyy many overdrive distortion pedals , , I know I 'm talking ) flexibility rivaled none market anything close price.What makes CM-2 great , like several reviews mentioned , 's another tube-screamer clone . There distinct mid-range hump slightly rolled bass tubescreamers ( particularly TS-9 ) known . There lot range knobs ; level add serious boost , bass treble knobs allow significantly change tone 's 're , dial ( never completely ) transparent . Also , CM-2 gain tap overdrive pedals ; go basically clean boost adding surprising amount saturation tone . Lastly , classic vs. modified switch gives option adding gain bass switching classic 've tested CM-2 overdrive clean channel Fender Hotrod Deville , front-end boost Bugera 1990 ( basically Marshall JCM 900 ) . The CM-2 sounds great applications . Over clean channel Fender , sounds full smooth . Even turned way , overdrive never sounded `` grainy '' fuzzy ; maintained warmed , organic , tube-like . `` '' I would characterize . Great blues playing , I 'm sure playing tone knobs could dial good country tones well.However , I use front-end boost Bugera amp . In front lead channel , CM-2 serves take tone hard-rock crunch territory metal tone , chunky bass roaring highs make riffs sound home coming Peavey conclusion , I 'm really pleased quality Digitech CM-2 . Both sound build quality top-notch , price similar less quality overdrive pedals market , I highly recommend checking CM-2 . This one pedal I ca n't without . You sculpt guitar tone hits amp , 's key getting tight rhythm tone high gain . So I encounter amp n't tight enough , high gain distortion n't sound good , I turn gain use lower gain channel , hit hard pedal . Sounds much better internal high gain , things might want know buy : * The gain knob turned zero still produces overdrive . So ca n't use boost pedal . With high output humbuckers , still get mild tube-like overdrive zero gain . But n't advertised clean boost pedal . * So much gain / distortion pedal 're going clean channel amp ? Plenty classic rock blues . Not enough metal , though crank gain high knob way barely get prog style metal tone . But 's distortion pedal , 's overdrive . * This thing uses tiny components circuitry therefore n't really . * Unlike Bad Monkey , n't additional mixer / cabinet emulated output . * Like tube screamer , boosts mids reduces bass going mushy sounding tube channel get tighter distorted sound . Anyone nice warm amp gets pedal thinking 'll get , may disappointed . What need instead transparent clean boost pedal keeps guitar tone louder volume . * The switch pretty cool . I two guitars , one kind bassy scooped sounding , bright middy . Well , using switch , I make one come equivalent needed . This keeps adjusting amp time I switch guitars . Classic slightly lower gain , sound . Quite tight . Think Peavey EQ structure . Modified scooped , saturated . Think Mesa EQ structure . So switch useful little bonus . * It eats batteries , sucking around 150 mA 9V , 300 mAH rechargeable lasts hrs . I swear blue LED n't bright would probably get extra hour . Instead getting adapter , I got AA clip , 9V battery clip , 12V DC plug , 8 Sanyo batteries . Hooked negative tip , positive sleeve I 16,000 mAH monster = 100 hours play time.This pedal perfect . You get 's advertised . It 's rugged , looks good . I n't found noisy , unless something wrong guitar ( strings grounded bridge , etc ... ) . Someone mentioned silver tops dials falling , I looked knobs seem like one solid piece thing I found instead using overdrive plugin DAW , I use real overdrive pedal front interface , magically makes hum / noise pickups go , yes I highly recommend , would suggest people check Hardwire Metal Distortion want something standalone rather overdrive crunchy amp . Like others , though , I ca n't stop playing . Great purchase , especially bought used . The CM-2 magnificent : [ 1 ] It produces beautiful overdrive ( one n't destroy guitar 's tone ) . [ 2 ] It independent `` High '' `` Low '' tone controls , controls extremely sensitive even minor changes -- thus allowing great versatility tone-manipulation . [ 3 ] It features switch allows pick `` classic '' overdrive extra blast distortion ( `` modified '' ) . [ 4 ] The case made metal . [ 5 ] It comes cover knobs avoid altering settings depressing pedal . This pedal give `` metal '' distortion ; consider Digitech 's TL-2 . Instead , produces warm , overdriven tone . I love thing ! 
877	First , I use 6 band EQ using lower highest LP HP filters . The middle four dramatic effect tone . You also use boost box , using gain volume sliders . The box solid fairly easy manipulate stage , I tend set reviewing posts maybe bullets may turn gain way , hiss . Period , holds true effect box amp gain I exposed . Have reason upping gain , add volume consider guitar tone , create ! A Strat made sound like Les Paul vice versa . Your tone made many , many variables . The resulting tone adding subtracting certain frequencies . That function EQ , nothing . IT range dramatic subtle . Very small changes large effects . Small bumps higher range really enhance harmonics I able produce.-I tend put EQ much later effect chain , feel free experiment . This pedal works well , lets sculpt pleasing sound suit situation . A little goes long way sliders , gain level functions occasionally useful . Nice accessory tube amp amp lacking good onboard eq . It makes much easier dial exact sound want , easier messing eq knobs interact bands little overkill guitar . Three outside range instrument , I bought one I like blinks clipping , extra volume gain sliders , comes AC adaptor . This adds noise I tell , except sliders amplifies noise already there.It 's around quality product I imagine I 'll still twenty years . another guy said & # 34 ; could live without pedal ? & # 34 ; agree , got two , one base guitar , one outstanding , simply best . thank u mxr ! I Fender Rod Deluxe , though 's got Electronics Mod ... still needed nice touch.This guy filled need ! Using Effects Loop , need Volume Gain , sound way much richer definition different types guitars beautiful . Comes thing controls tone well ! ! ! ! ! Everything much worth money im starting fall love MXR ! I never considered using EQ pedal seeing buying , man ... .I missing ! The ten bands truly incredible shaping precise sound especially impressive using distortion . Each band hyper sensitive ... tone ( high/mid/low ) five gain . Aside providing exact sound control , also boosts volume little functions overdrive well . If dont use distortion though , still benefit highly pedal , even clean channels become crisp effects pronounced . This especially highlighted using delay chorus , distinctly noticeable regardless . By far versatile pedal I ever used . I cant imagine using I . One note ... .you run adapter chain dont want dedicate outlet one pedal ... .but , really cool power supply included purchase . Just ups value even . I really cant recommend highly enough . I think every guitarist bass player ! This always pedal me.It 's end pedal board right really allowed wake board - I like fact I adjust fly I n't totally agree tone nice - built like brick - every guitarist bassist needs one whether run pedal board . 
878	These made solid stable . I knocked 4 stars n't match . The holes poles safety pin interval stand look funky . They well built hold almost speaker system throw . I already recommended friend bought . He likes . I bought set Amazon 's warehouse deals page discount expected damage . They showed pretty good shape though surprise ! I expecting damage items , hoping 2 would able salvage enough put together one full stand . I bought I needed ONLY 1 stand good height mounting 32 '' LCD Flat screen . I use TV studio everyone see 's going record work music . I needed something going sturdy hold TV high enough everyone studio would able see time.Both stands showed good working condition . They go 8 ' tall perfect mounting speakers onto , although I use mount TV ceiling height weight speakers . They work GREAT ! I 'm going add pictures creation get around , give month ... . Great speaker stands , well constructed easy adjustments different setups.Carry case nice set Two stands case promptly perfect stands carry case delivered price one stand many places , Great Deal ! Bought two sets . Both arrived together expected delivery date . I bought two sets Pyle Pro months previously also included pair 25ft 1/4 '' cabling Amazon dealer arrived without problems . Initially , I noticed slight difference two models centered around way adjusting clamp allowed extension center speaker poles . Personally , I think easier setup Pyle Pro PSTK103 . Later comparison showed PSTK103 also substantially taller length tripod legs retracted center speaker pole.However , way packaged severely opinion much manufacturer really cared products . The paint finish chipped several areas legs . There dimples nicks several areas leg tubing . Why I blame manufacturer 's packaging way handled shipping simple ... tripod legs multiple connections protrude joints aside use thin plastic bags separate two units laying upside side-by-side within small confines included unpadded travel bag within shipping , protection prevent tripod unit physically rubbing banging one another transport afforded . Really , hard would separate two units within travel bag corrugated cardboard strip expanded foam ? ! ! ! On plus side ... testing tripod stands ... seemed function perfectly well . The units light yet seemed solid stable set . The price seemed right thought manner packaging improved ... I would definitely say thus far seems like great buy . Only time use I able determine unit holds truly bargain . I ordered stands hoping would better price indicated . However , bag ripped 3 places . The stands scratched badly lots paint missing . The annoying thing match . The locking mechanism different stand different heights . The holes inner poles drilled different places order use support pins speakers height , adjust legs accommodate difference height . They looked like might relatively solid I returned anyway ... bit disappointing . The bag simple canvas . It probably wo n't protect steel ball attack . However , stands sturdy , fully adjustable , look professional . Both stands parts fallen , missing together . When pamphlet comes states fully assembled guaranteed free defects , major concern . It may I got bad box got missed quality control , make suspicious Pyle products . These basic speaker stands PA systems ... 're functional , durable , set-up within seconds . I would given higher rating , however upon receipt , one stands would lock place kept sliding regardless tight I set tension . While inspecting bag , I found hard plastic block looked like part aluminum tubing speaker stand . Further inspection confirmed ' indeed part tube , several minutes wrestling , I able get lodged back inside . The block part tension & # 34 ; mechanism & # 34 ; forced back tube , stand ( ) performed flawlessly . 
879	want amp-like vibrato chorus , ya go , 's cheap cool looking ( bigger footprint Boss pedal ) . The ' control gently affects tone . pedals great . Nice quality unbelievable price point . This pedal exception . It great sounding vibe bonus nice chorus engaged toggle switch . fair I tried many vibes . Hard cost twice cost pedal . That said I absolutely pleased sound pedal need look elswhere . vibe Trower like . Think bridge signs . Chorus mellower side . Very analog sounding digital . Replaced BBE mind fits bill much better . Solid well built last . I would problem gigging issue year pedal seemed bit less strong effect . I read online bit electrical tape around internal led 's would fix problem indeed . It 's fine since . Despite needed fix I would buy pedal hesitation I needed look pedal doesnt cost arm leg , far vibes chorus pedals pedal falls short . I wasnt looking sending alot gets job done : I compared , side side , following pedals : Fulltone mini vibe ( $ 200 ) , Dunlop ( discontinued stainless steel model ) ( $ 220 ) , Dunlop ( $ 180 ) , Voodoo Labs Micro Vibe ( $ 150 ) , BBE Soul Bender ( $ 129 ) well comparing `` different '' modulation family - MXR phase 90 , MXR EVH flanger , Boss chorus , Behringer Vibrato , Behringer Time - great pedal favorite uni-vibe . Does n't take lot space , standard power supply , good visibility control knob settings . Does add subtract frequencies signal add noise . This pedal univibe group I say 's 's almost certainly going one I keep . Might slightly less ability produce thick univibe effect others -- still need play little . Overall I LOVE pedal 60 bucks . Only downsides I see LED flash speed rate , speed control top left makes hard `` toe tweak '' right foot . Quality seems ok , time tell form factor , although slightly larger `` boss '' pedal , n't take much room standard Standard power supply ( 9v Center negative ) , jack top back easy access - way patch cables sides.- chorus ( univibe ) vibrato.- Controls spaced well handling use knobs high visibility marking - easy see.- Best PRO boost cut volume boost cut bass , mids , lows . It applies uni-vibe type effect dialed retains character guitar tone . This pedal I tested I say -- others cost 2-4 times one LED red , visible NOT weird bright laser retina- The PRICE 60 bucks - great Quality construction -- metal case , decent knobs , pots switches - complaints LED flash speed rate- Speed control would better placed Top right bottom right `` toe '' tweaking- I day ca n't tell might limited getting lush univibe sound - sure I update review I get time test . But sounds great ... - highly recommended want univibe n't want lot comparison shopping . I done . Some users report quality issues -- I guess time tell . Mine works fine far , $ 60 could buy 2 still save money options -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- ON PEDALS I -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- Fulltone Mini vibe -- highest quality construction ( expected $ 200 ) . The large knob lower right corner speed great allows toe tweaking -- useful vibe pedal . My complaint vibe colors tone - boosts mid range tones maintaining crisp highs slightly losing bass . This probably helps sound stand mix , however , I 'd rather vibe provide EQ I switch , I n't want compensate guitar tone knobs try get back `` sound '' . I able match exactly authentic original Uni-vibe sound adjusting . It seems kind muffle pick attack compress also . I love-hate relationship pedal week testing . Some days I hate ... I like build quality speed control . I originally liked one two pedals n't strip treble tone -- I realized mids boosted , bass cut pick attack somehow tweaked . Mixed bag , $ 200 n't MXR/Dunlop M68 ( new 2014 ) . At $ 140 , The new M68 good vibe pedal much like . It second place list . On pure sound I might even like slightly better Jimi , 's saying something ! It 's perfect form factor ( shape/size ) significant coloration tone , perhaps tiny boost treble one mode . The M68 gives Jimi good run ... extremely tight board space , might better choice . They sound similar . The M68 wider range adjustment speed/depth Jimi , I 'm sure extra range useful . Dunlop/MXR GREAT factory customer service ever issue . They fixed one pedals free even though warranty . I really wish MXR would move power supply jack rear vertical surface instead right side vertical surface . It often way right angle plugs MXR 's . Use small top left push button switching chorus vibe pedal main negative issue I 'd leave mini switch engaged , red LED burning time , looking like I actually engaging circuit main switch . It also tight fit . This pedal level knob I 'm usually fan I n't see need effect . I n't care white `` main '' LED much , course power supply location . The LED pulse speed , annoying due white LED . That 's subjective thing I suppose . All said great sounding option perfect MXR size , good choice . But still 2X cost Jimi . I stuck Jimi form , function , sound , value.- Dunlop Uni-vibe -- Cool stainless steel construction . Knobs hard see settings . placement vintage switch back pedal easily forgotten worst awkward best . standard 18V power supply takes double slots power supply brick . Sound good also color EQ sound boosting bass , muffling mids highs slightly . On one hand , sound matched lot recorded uni-vibe sounds I 've heard . On hand , strip treble hard put back mix . The seller 3 day return policy ( 3 days ? ? ! ! ) I returned lost sale . , I would still thinking one . I fence whether winner . I able match true uni-vibe sample , treble slightly lacking . At $ 220 I 'd love keep it.- Voodoo Labs Micro Vibe - Liked form factor , simple controls , high visibility knobs , ability toe tweak controls , standard 9V power supply , placement jacks . Can get lush , even excessive univibe sound except bass boosted , cut . The EQ effect kills pedal . Its going back . Not pick $ BBE Soul Bender - My least favorite Vibe . It extreme muffling mids highs , heavy boost bass . In band mix , I 'm pretty sure would get totally lost . At home , might sound ok. form factor good , controls simple , I think pulsed speed . My recollection overly bright blue LED . It first vibe I bought , I compared Fulltone Dunlop returning . Had useable sounds , intensity 50 % annoying `` womp womp womp '' bass note coming guitar -- weird defect effect sound opinion . With intensity 50 % usable ... kind . But tone . I returned one Dunlop : A good choice ( perhaps choice ) MUST expression pedal controlled speed adjustment . Did n't color tone much - problem uni-vibes tested . Limited speed range awkward controls placement annoying . Intensity range seemed less pedals . Large footprint mounted board , also offers ability take NO space board mounting . I n't like switch effect , automatically high speed due mechanical nature design . Some awkwardness placement controls power plug vs guitar cables plugged . power supply plus . LED indicators good flash speed . Durable construction although mechanical nature means time something need lubricating may need replace internal gears pots . Overpriced 1.5 2X Other general modulation effects . effectively phase effect - without swooshy space-age edge sound . You probably modify modern phaser pedal get univibe sound like vibrato plus analog chorus combined . A modern phaser close , modern flanger much space-age sounding . Vibrato pedals capture vibrato aspect uni-vibe I 'd recommend behringer vibrato $ 25 like vibrato sounds . uni-vibes normally used `` chorus '' setting , vibrato setting . Did n't care Behringer time gear used testing : Fender American Deluxe stratocaster . Mesa amplifier , Mesa Rectifier 2x12 cabinet Celestion V30 's . Pedal train pedal board , voodoo labs pedal power power supplies.A NOTE ON bad experience vendor I bought MXR/Dunlop M68 , weigh review product , I provided separate star rating vendor feedback page . I recommend choose purchase pedal ( anything else ) careful avoid Amazon Marketplace vendor called MixDSPnet San , CA . In addition charging 15 % restocking fee want return pedal ( original condition materials packaging ) , getting even acknowledge return request problem took week finally opening claim Amazon get meaningful response . Once communicate , unprofessional . Further , product shipped back signature required ( recommended amazon ) , `` available '' refused sign several weeks attempting return product , remains despite confirmation I could return item 85 % refund . I expect I 'll need work Amazon end get resolved . A google earth view addressed explained . MixDSPnet appears running apartment complex . Most Amazon marketplace sellers fine one really , least comes returns . Also , sell Dunlop/MXR guitar pedals , looking site reveals 's primary business - seem sell bunch non-musical widgets . My recommendation find vendor musical instrument business provide typical cost refunds 30 45 days large musical instrument retailers , need . They hundred positive transactions , maybe OK I comment experience worst online transaction I 've ever shopping amazon . Why ? For price reviews I found online , I try pedal . I bought one remained pedalboard since I 've bought . NOTE : I recently put right wah dirt boxes I 've found two things ; 1 . The vibe sound n't get smooshed retains rounded sound 2. volume drop might experience od/distortion seems less . I suggest playing around trying pedal different places pedal chain see works best . For , stay od pedals fuzz . Do favor check youtube demos . Mine ... .this pedal AFTER pedals , 'll get good idea general settings I use . Rugged pedal little known company . Took shot dark , hit ! Great univibeish/old chorus device . Would like see stereo output options future models . Solid . If Strat , studied Jimi , suit well 've got right physical approach guitar . 
880	I like pedal . Its rugged great range tonal capabilities rips hardcore metal . That said , blue LED cool looking actually blinding I found placing finger see friggin ' knobs adjustments . I guess pretty weak complaint IMO 's enhancement . Also Gate buttons feels pretty flimsy ... expected price point . A moot point I using Gate least IMO & # 34 ; weird & # 34 ; execution , sounded kind like rough used instead nice smooth curve . But thing tears terms pure shredding tone . BOTTOM LINE UP FRONT : The MXR Fullbore Metal distortion suitable modern metal music . It 's 3-band EQ adjustable Q gives MXR FM ability model virtually every distortion there.WHAT I LIKE pedal 's small , easy operate , n't take much time dial tone want . I play Marshall JCM2000 going 1960A 4x12 using Les Paul Standard , sounds amazing . I love onboard Marshall tube distortion , line New Wave Of British Heavy Metal ( obviously ) , entirely suitable modern American . The MXR Fullbore Metal gets I need go . This nice I use amp good clean overdrive channel , tap Fullbore I need play I pedal generates lot white noise , careful Treble knobs . However I also noticed amount white noise also depended amp 's EQ settings well , know advance 'll need spend good proper setup recording purposes.WHAT ABOUT THE EH ? I owned Metal Muff years , pedal totally blows away . The big & # 34 ; selling point & # 34 ; MM Top Boost . Big deal . I wrote review MM Amazon , summary , Top Boost makes everything sound weird unmusical . Comparing Top Boost Noise Gate terms big & # 34 ; selling point & # 34 ; , Fullbore 's Noise Gate ( adjustable sensitivity ) seems like MUCH better feature thinking tight want rhythm guitar leads sound.WHAT ABOUT THE BOSS ME-70 ? I currently ME-70 , totally honest - I think negative peer pressure crap guitarist 's give multi-effects mind think pedalboard thousand bucks worth pedals & # 34 ; real & # 34 ; whereas multi-effects pedals & # 34 ; fake & # 34 ; . This might true extent , modern digital modeling getting close vintage analog signal chains ... point trade-off indeed make sense . ( FYI : Dave uses DigiTech part live rig ) . # . Anyway , Boss ME-70 settings useful onstage , much recording since end , sound tad digital , ME-70 signal . The MXR Fullbore compress , sounds analog , wins.FOR ? I bought pedal I wanted dedicated metal distortion use Metal EP I 'm self-recording . In conjunction ADA GCS-3 , I created all-analog signal chain direct interface sounds amazing . Check ADA GCS-3 . It 's amazing speaker simulator , take pedal throw convert beautifully sounding emulation pedal 's 1x12 combo amplifier . Anyway , GCS-3 , Fullbore basically sounds like ONLY 4 STARS ? The Fullbore n't everybody , n't every guitar , every amp , , 's really friggin good . I suppose EQ 12AX7 preamp circuit , would & # 34 ; best metal pedal & # 34 ; , small piece gear , 's probably best analog distortion market . This pedal ok best lot better metal pedals thing one really going built noise gate wise pedal pretty thin sounding far much gain ever need . I would personally recommend Electro-Harmonix Metal Muff day better sounding pedal price . Tis pedal really I wanted kick little combo butt . Hard rock heavy metal , classic metal shines . I n't mess noise gate I ca n't really comment . everything else first rate good tone dicey controls . Like features especially noise gate use scoop much . This peddle works great ! I looked many products , right distortion one topped . So glad I went Best distortion ever used . It took finally got / The Hero Tone Plus overdrive A lot people like Metal Muff say dial distortion sounds . Well I . The Muff good various tones , MXR gives full metal tone . Having built gate also nice works ! The Muff lot noisy . But I like em . I use different tones . If want full metal tone , get , trust ; )

882	It exactly need capo ! You cover six strings , move one string get drop tuning turn capo upside get partial capo ( though bit adjusting may needed get strings held . ) .All , great capo well made last awesome small Christian company I really like products supporting purchases . : ] Love capos nice get colours . getting confused one elses . My son needed Capo , expensive music shop takes lessons . At Amazon found wanted reasonable price . The title says . I got $ 16 ( free shipping Amazon Prime ) , cheaper local music store . I keep head guitar , easy add , move , remove . With trigger-type release , makes one easiest quick-change capos I 've used . It feels sturdy enough ( lightweight aluminum ) . And best ... works ! I like , works well takamine acoustic jasmine s35 guitar . And looks good . Overall , I recommend . Quick clip . Really ... Is anything else say ? What else want ? These suckers wonderfully reliable.I 've one 10 years . The thing went wrong removable rubber `` bottom '' capo became damaged neglect . However , $ 1 , sent bag 6 . Can go wrong ? NO ! Great product ! couple bucks dunlop ... tried..i couple wish would one works well made ... arrived time..enjoy Like camo capo 's simplicity unique color . My friend got new one seeing using , bit shorter mine . Mine works uke & acoustic guitar , I problem use single hand . As manufactor suggests duration , I n't clip guitar 's use . : ) This Capo looks great job . It take bit pressure open camp , better winding versions . Purchased 6-string Kyser capo I meant get 12-string version ( slightly longer , stronger spring ? ) , find 6-string Capo works great 2 6-string acoustics , also works 12-string acoustic little adjusting . Quality seems top notch , design simple effective . I 've owned one 10 years 's still going strong many gigs . The spring tension right . Basically easiest squeeze opinion . I big hands may part . high quality hassle free design . Very quick easy install remove hurry dos n't mar finish use excessive force , strong enough move capo way close next fret closer headstock allow maximum room fingers without buzzing . Very happy purchase . I one two years complaints , needed another travel guitar . The lever arm coated soft plastic sleeve protects neck , spring firm 2 years given tension . Finally string compression side material firm yet supple . I take particular caution make sure I n't leave anything would indent material permanently ... I 've seen used many different types capos years range cumbersome difficult use easily breakable I 've never used one convenient well constructed Kyser one . It far best I 've ever seen I 've using years still works fine . It makes moving capo quickly cinch gold n't corrode tarnish making look like new even years.Very highly recommended ! It well made , easy use , holds strings fine . It well protected scratch nick guitar . Durable , affordable , easy grasp use . This capo good I 've ever used pink perfectly shell pink strat . Great deal . I use two types capos - Kyser one Shubb capos . Both popular capos around different strengths weaknesses.The benefits Kyser quickest changing capo I 've come across , n't require tension adjustment , clip end headstock use . The primary benefit Shubb adjustable tension ( second , 's smaller ) .The main drawback Kyser lack adjustable tension . Because 's designed work across fretboard , apply force necessary clamp lower frets , causing frets wear faster time . Because I prefer use Kyser less expensive guitar Shubbs guitar I baby . Easy useGreat quality I looking forward purchasing brand . Thank much Got I needed - basic capo good price . The tension little tighter I 'd like , works . strings , fully . I n't use often , I ca n't speak longevity , good ! I 've played guitar 5 years . Seen many different capos , none quite satisfies really ca n't go wrong capo . It mobile , easily adjustable , sturdy , 's good capo use regular 6 String capo still turn around use Cut capo . The transparent rubber piece job.It comes different colors also.I black , silver , gold , camo Kyser capos.I also Cut Capo styles.I recommend ! All capos I 've Kyser still great time church home I started using Kyser capos couple years ago never looked back since . I several problems . They work great acoustic electric guitars survived many children I teach lessons even though get treated rather rough times . Great capos . You wo n't disappointed . The handle spring strength make uncomfortable place guitar , I feel rushed clamp capo 's unpleasant use - hurts fingers . It 's cheap easy use . It 'll job , I n't like . What 's say ? It 's high end capo price I lose ( like capos I owned ) . It 's high quality capo take adjustments get seated properly . I originally bought guitar worked well , I tried 4 string uke works great . It 's much better elastic capos . So , 's double duty going strong . This style capo CAN throw guitar tune n't put right . When used correctly though , 's job fine . I repeat everyone else already said : Kyser capo designed built well . It 's easy put adjust , easy take . There probably capos bit flashier , still pretty stylish . And price makes real bargain .

884	I must say , beginning I thrilled product . The coloring adds relatively subtle unless cranked , however using several weeks using , I notice difference . I found using gain input distortion pedal results warm sweet sounding crunch : - ) nice . The type coloring available dip switch , I guess ok. Not highly accessible though . All stayed effects chain wah wah distortion box . I normally leave use stomps available distortion pedal . No plans remove . I 've nothing pleased pedal far . I use boost jazz bass volume level precision . It job perfectly . The LED REALLY bright , good thing , others might find distracting . Also , would convenient external switches instead internal dip switches varying settings , small footprint , bound tradeoffs . I 'd buy sure . A booster makes signal louder ! That case clean market like MXR Micro Amp , EHX LPB-1 , BBE , Modtone , etc . They keep guitar 's original tone , make louder pushed enough , add good amount gain & grit . But something else going Xotic EP Booster . Yes , also makes signal louder , adds gain little dirt , also makes overall sound bigger & wider ! Based vintage units used guitar heroes like Jimmy Page , Duane Allman , Moore , etc . This pedal really small size , one knob & footswitch . It internal dip switch . You open back pedal & choose setting . I leave classic setting , turn gain knob 9 10 o'clock & leave time . I tried & OD pedals personal preference `` '' ! Being front amp , n't much I tried use dirt channel tube amp . I put FX loop & boosted signal alright I n't like much front amp boosting OD pedals.This one pedal stay board . I n't take much space , built last make anything throw sound better . It one job well ! Look best Booster internal EQ , else ask ? Go , need versatile small booster , comes 9v battery Indeed , little wonder make famous . Not unlike & # 34 ; Three Moon & # 34 ; shirt , little pedal get ladies ( 're lady , likely get guys ) . Either way , gets want ! On top , great job boosting signal guitar getting bit & # 34 ; oomph & # 34 ; . In particular , I find helpful I 'm running lower output guitar long cable . Did I mention blue light ? The downside open back ( screwdriver , put shopping list n't one ) adjust little switches chance tone . As soon I kicked pedal unity gain , difference obvious . I please boost feature amazing one important reason : noise level nothing like I expecting . I keep amp clean & I found even around 11:00 noise still almost unnoticeable . At noon & 's start playing even , 's still much lower guitar . There 's also almost FX going noticeable , especially I compared BBE BOOST . First rate pedal ! This simple boost small footprint fits nicely pedal board ... I like simplicity ability set dip switches liking ... I find humbucker pickups adds right , slight tone coloration fattens sound gives right sparkle ... I n't use much single coils since n't seem benefit much coloration treble boost ... good pedal board need little something extra get right tone ... built solid ... quality pedal hold well ... It arrived day seems well-build . Have n't tried yet . My always pedal . This pedal 's amazing . You really try understand . I 'm using Fender Jaguar , thing married . I 'm serious , try die ! I bought boost use one specific situation . When playing lead line bridge pick tone knob way , volume drops quite dramatically . This boost says remedy , also seems add lot noise . When boost , super high gain Fryette Deliverance 120 quiet I hold hand strings . I 'm using 2010 LP Custom stock pick neck bridge . When I turn boost I immediately hear lot extraneous hissing noise . When playing n't bad , I definitely used much extra noise . There couple adjustment switches inside , I n't fooled yet , I 'm definitely going . This boost prob help guys lower end gear get better sound , 've already got pro quality stuff I n't see much advantage . I tempted buy pedal long time looking rave reviews.I already MXR line booster end pedal chain amp . This serves give back lost treble shimmer long cable run . Replacing EP booster significant impact tone . Yes little colored , different line present boost pedals long cable run , yes definitely pedal make world difference adding top end back signal . I n't find magical though , I 've always boost end chain much different.I going experiment effects loop add boost solos . 
885	Item described . You receive 3 felt picks , plus bonus music pick . ( mine purple ) Picks defect free , bonus pick noticeably dusty felt picks , clean moist cloth easily fix . But picks bit dusty could transfer instrument . None less picks make uke sound louder may hearing pick little bit . But time starts disappear . The picks pretty comfy hold . Too thick , flexibility . Sounds really harsh like ruining ukulele strings . Tried bass , less satisactory results . These picks ok need stiff side . I looking semi-soft felt picks . I bought picks description said ukulele . I hard time using picks uke . I guess , I n't like way uke sounds using . It sounds harsh picks stiff.But I sure people may disagree . As far quality vendor delivery , I happy I use picks occasionally . Yes , I would recommend uke players . I would like let people know stiff . I guess I thought felt would n't stiff . But I new playing instrument , I guess I n't much knowledge picks . The picks work well bass , thick use ukulele . The pics also shed easily , making instrument dusty time . I actually use bass fingers worn heavy playing , sound finger string , actually really neat thing bag . I recomend trying one time . 
886	This definitely must home recording enthusiast , especially using XENYX Behringer brand mixers ( also works mixers well ) .This great , inexpensive , way get analog audio digital recording software . It works Windows , Mac Linux ( least ) . I love laptop , . It almost everything I need .. almost . A mic jack , inputs . The Behringer U Control gives STEREO . The Behringer reputation pulls . I 've tried USB sound cards without success . This product puts older laptop besides newer ones . Well done Behringer ! ! ! I live shows online , older Behringer mixer built USB port , great job . I constantly get comments clean clear sound , I largely attribute mixer , digitizer important link chain . Very simple use , audio mixer goes digitizer , plug USB cable computer , streaming software sees , people hear . I definitely Behringer fan . I use Behringer mixer run laptop computer record music . It I needed give clean sound . Running USB give great flexibility also makes recordings sound like I studio . I highly recommend . One big selling points unit sound quality need drivers . Well - starting use Windows 7 x64 I dismayed find simply awful electrical interference buzz recordings . I went Behringer website , I found product page , found tab drivers , downloaded boom ... . problems solved taken days days . Needless say portion marketing crap - drivers absolutely required use Windows 7 . I using Behringer 1202FX mixer - good combo . The build quality nothing shout even though enclosure plastic feels sturdy enough . I treat gear care - I figure 'll probably last years years years . I extremely happy , hopeful somebody read review skip drivers immediately upon installation . Ok I understand - I use Live 8 thought would easy , read cheap , interface record instruments . WRONG ! I returning . It work , drivers detected Mac ( Mac finds everything ) . Bought Focusrite unit instead . Got work garage band latency miserable hiss recordings . Save money time . Buy Focusrite interface one others . Yes $ 100 either want feedback , hiss frustration want smooth interface connection good resonance . It also lacks 1/4 plug , one rca input , need . Not I thought I getting - dumb . It 's hard argue consider price charge . It works 's far away best cheap option go want record audio computer.I use Audacity . At first , I found recordings rather noisy lots hiss . After fooling around couple hours trying figure , I thought audio interface cheap product . The next day , I fooled around realized I needed turn mic input ( Audacity ) turn gain halfway mixer . When I , completely shut hiss . I 've making great recordings since.It 's plug play tool , come kind instructions problems like I experienced . However , matter setting computer properly thing works well.For wondering latency , obviously 's . You 'll get latency type recording device . You account settings audio editing program.The thing legit complaint playback bit noisy hissy headphones headphones turned high . It sound like recordings , though . So , 's OK . I deal good product ca n't beat price . When comes quality , set correctly . When set properly , quality fantastic . It would nice kind troubleshooting guide came , though . I 'm audiophile , I 've spent adult life looking outstanding devices make exquisite sound available & # 34 ; rest us & # 34 ; realistic prices .

Great product ! You spend ton studio-level , interface , I wanted get two analog channels two ( ) PC , fits bill . Works perfectly Audacity Windows 7 , plug play . This unit works great taking line level something like audio mixer even old cassette deck converting USB audio input . I used headphone monitoring section ( doubt I ever would ) I comment feature , unit simple use I pleasantly surprised.For anyone band - I used device take line PA system old laptop running ( free ) Audacity software blown away quality recording .

I playing gig small pub . A friend swears Sure mics asked could song break . I said sure . When done , said , I LOVE mic . The sound awesome . said . I 'm reviewing spending couple hours trying get work Behringer 802 Xenyx mixer , I finally nearly throwing towel . Turns I using mixer 's switch incorrectly , thus getting poor results feedback . I finally went You Tube found Behringer guy video 's less 2 minutes length unit hooked mixer computer . Just taking look video made realize something simple I wrong - I . Once I got working correctly , I could believe results everything dialed correctly , including control PC controlled recording volume unit . So , I 'm looking forward real recording , using Audacity main recording software . ( Edit : I recording dealie weekend really , really pleased results - I hardly wait recording . So , arrogant salesman local music chain store tried sale $ 150.00 Lexicon unit , I wo n't needing - I 'm quite happy little interface , thank much . And everyone else , n't forget keep thing hooked PC use simply listen music hard drive sound lot better stock on-board sound card . Thanks Behringer , great value ! ! I two Behringer boxes ( come two ) use internal software sound ( Roland Virtual sound ) play back midi files live two piece band . The sound PA ( Soundcraft mixer Mackie active speakers ) loud clear , cases , eq needed . I guess really revolves around personal needs . For live performance Behringer boxes excellent price steal . I use record home recording done stand alone DAW ( Tascam 24 track ) .If live musician DJ using something like Virtual DJ boxes great way eliminate low level hum laptop give better sound internal laptop sound cards . This solid little USB Interface . There frills , 's latency . I used @ 4 years without problems , 's portable . I run small , 8 channel mixer laptop recording guitar , 's well worth price one around . Can also used tape players import audio computer ; I use guitar recording . Got based reviews , especially one took time really expound . I used recording cassette computer , I really bought use interface mixing board computer . Should work fine . The seller fast , getting 2 weeks ahead projected arrival 've used Behringer equipment , may may impressed quality . Just remember , although may engineered Germany , made China . said . This particular unit seems built pretty well , time tell . I picked simple interface back 2007 I attest still works flawlessly years ! It 's gigged , dropped , even rained , however still sounds great functions perfectly . I using laptop interface combined free ASIO4All driver , I able get anywhere latency . Under Windows 7 , plug play default driver , however really take advantage capabilities , 'll want install ASIO4All , especially 're using Ableton , FL Studio , , etc . All , UCA202 pretty limited , however allow easily get audio PC . For functionality alone , 's definitely worth asking price ! 
887	It job though . I n't impressed lack range , I 've never found use extreme settings phaser anyways . It seems unit keeps effect within safe comfortable range 's okay . I 'm happy pedal . It seems knock MXR phase pedal , provides nice classic , subtle phase effect . You flip switch `` swirl '' pronounced effect , I love keeping metal switch/button engage pedal n't `` click '' many pedals . I actually prefer . The `` click '' effects wear sooner . Some high end pedals also use smooth , way engaging pedal . You 'll know 's tone change bright led light . IMHO , n't need click switch.The sounds clean smooth , clear bright , could use describe great phase Value , way . It sounds like 's Behringer . Very fake , cheap sounding phaser , 's I need . I got mostly big airplane woosh , running loop , fine . The highs kind harsh , front amp sound little tame . Germany Company , manufacturing China ... I always found make product hit miss last two Behringer products hands good . I really dislike switch thing . It click . That may sound like much , I tend rest foot pedal I turn . This turn I . This unlike pedal I played . I realize Behringer trying copy MXR , switch substitution makes wish I picked used MXR . Anyway pedal sound fine , know switch may drive insane . I really like Behringer Boss type pedals though switch I like . Wish phase came different case . I borrowed friends MXR try liked added sounds gave . It filled hole missing . since 80 % board Behringer pedals I looked Behringer first delighted I found PH9 Classic 90 . Side side MXR , n't hole lot difference Behringer 's added swirl switch , gives options . It also made metal constantly criticize Behringer use plastic pedals . ( I 've read ton reviews still n't heard one breaking plastic ) As far value money spent , This pedal top list . Oh ! It also sounds great ! ! ! ! !

All create impression poorly-designed product , exactly opposite case.I Fender 5-way loaded pickguard part Squier upgrade . Beware traditional Strats 1 3/4 '' thick , many Bullets Affinity Strats slightly less . As , might bottom switch hitting inside guitar . You might need either live shave/sand portion interior 's switch works great , really , quite inexpensive relative importance ! 
892	I read mixed reviews pedal board , I tried half dozen multi effects pedals modeling processors pedals limitless combinations one . However , I found difficult adjust needs , cumbersome flip channels get sound I wanted modify . What I wanted four five single effects pedals I could preset value I usually use turn effect needed , giving lots combinations . I couple Boss pedals one Behringer one I ordered couple inexpensive Behringer units , I 'm generally pleased , though 're perhaps elite category . They work fine . I n't want 5 6 units cluttering space demanding wall wart.This compact board built case cord management perfect solution . Instead Velcro found many boards , foam cutouts hold B B pedals securely give enough room connectors daisy chain power supply stay tangle free . It plugs one adapter ( provided ) also comes short connectors connect pedal together.My pedals incredibly easy use extremely well organized . The case holds securely lid fits holds everything place transport . Everything ready play removing lid plugging outlet.The latches secure , simple plastic slide looks like could easily break . However , matching holes right next small lock even twist tie could inserted latch , I 'm extremely satisfied . If 're something similar , I 'm sure . The foam cutouts manipulated sizes pedals . I exactly enough fill , addition dedicated tuner mutes everything I tune . I already two Behringer stompboxes , thinking adding , I thought rather mess stage , I 'd get pedalboard . I n't really studied much , except note seemed way money worth . Then , recently I found one less hundred bucks , I really could n't pass . I impressed unit . It well made , well designed , comes sorts cords accessories . Nothing lacking start playing right away . I 'm sure easy brands stompboxes fit board ( may need trim foam holds little bit ) , I think board pretty universal whatever . I disappointed least . I think like board . If 've never pedalboard I 'd say pass one look one user-friendly . The pics description n't show insanely large . It 's big . Patch cables crap power supply n't seem sturdy enough kicked , I trouble using ( even practice ) lip case gets way foot hitting pedals.I ended giving one away friend getting Gator ' seperate power supply . Easier practice easier toss another case rather whole suitcase 's . This good investment . Everything sits case I never set cables . All I setup input guitar case , case amp , let 's forget power cable . It works amazing saves plenty time . I 've also seen reviews 's VERY , n't worry breaking easily . I love fact hide wires also convert storage bay space larger pedals ( wah volume ) . The concern people slight buzzing . I replaced power cable came one power cables came one pedals , sound went away . I would recomment anyone travels alot , n't lot space room , someone likes things neat compact time . This item VERY ! I got eliminate cords powered effects units well get something house everything securely . This board job least 6 pedals . The Behringer pedals fit nicely foam slots far moved around play . What I get used pedals longer floor , meaning I lift foot higher get boards edge press . It take getting used . One concern linked power cables n't disappear . I working . What I happy board ALWAYS ON plugged . The way shut power unplug . I wish power switch .

If switching different size guitars , could problem cause ca n't make on-the-fly quick adjustment stage , wrestling . This strap really beautiful . The Native American pattern goes beautifully classical guitar I made images wolves burned top . However , leather ends thick stiff , making hard slip strap buttons guitar . I tried put snap-on strap buttons really work holes strap knife get strap slip . I nice strap soft , pliable leather ends slip strap buttons little effort - workable one hand . I 'd give Levy 's strap 5 stars ends flexible . Levy 's could made guitar strap softer material , especially edges . It cuts neck horribly , even thru shirt . .

895	My first guitar ever , I happy . I read great reviews price seemed good . It slightly darker color picture , others mentioned . And top part n't pink like pic , also others mentioned . It still looks pretty . I another reviewer suggested replaced strings extra light ones ( minimize finger pain ) I ordered `` d'addario phosphor bronze acoustic guitar strings , extra light '' package three sets . And I like strings better . The color nicer ( though originals n't rusty , looked new -- others said strings rusty mine n't ) importantly 's easier beginner like play lighter ( thinner ) strings.I might also someone else said lower string height filing one part ( I female 's already hard enough press strings cause fingers shorter man 's , especially bar chords ) , fine.I also ordered `` 6024 grip tip '' guitar picks , nice . And I got `` kyser 6-string capo '' gold works well . And I got `` planet waves acoustic guitar quick release system '' add-on guitar strap provide security tying string neck . The strap I got Levy 's pretty pattern comfortable . And I got `` planet waves pro winder '' string winder/cutter came handy re-stringing . And I bought acoustic guitar gig bag I n't tried yet . And I keep guitar sitting `` stage xcg4 '' guitar stand . And I got string cleaner I write case beginner like idea buy along new guitar . I 'll using mine sing , 's I needed capo cause many songs I sing need capo . I use lot youtube tutorials learn play , also find tabs/chords `` ultimate-guitar '' website . I tune guitar free using program garageband ( music recording program comes mac computers ) garageband also great guitar tutorial video lesson series helpful . I satisfied purchase . It came big rectangular box inside box another one looked like ! Haha made laugh . And inside lovely new guitar . I bought guitar 2 years ago I played tons different acoustic guitars Taylor Fender . This far nicest acoustic guitar I played . The action low guitar stays tune well . I love chrome tuners guitar stays tune far longer guitars . Additionally , favorite guitar I would recommend guitar anyone wanting play acoustic . This guitar could easily pass one 1000 dollar guitars . The guitar finish I prefer done playing guitar covered oil smears hands . I love Takamine producing beautiful guitar great value . This guitar last forever made nice . Recommend anyone whether pro player armature I promise wo n't disappointed I playing 6 years I know guitar players looking good guitar . Thanks Takamine ! ! ! ! ! This toy . It 's well crafted instrument . Material wood . Decent quality . Plain wood nice tone colors . Good refinements . around hole stripe back . Strings oxidation . made shipped Indonesia . Metal strings . So 's consideration 're beginner . Sounds good . I prefer sound metal guitar anyway . So 're beginner intermediate player needs nice instrument hanging around home occasional strum . It pleasant addition home guitars . It 's wife learning guitar . She loves . And costs 10 % mine costs , I n't mind playing . The plastic plate front protects strumming . I n't even . It 's feel good guitar . Highly recommended occasional strummer . After going various stores trying many guitars ( Yamaha , Ibanez , Fender others ) I researched internet stumbled upon saw MANY positive reviews . I reluctant purchase instrument without playing first , I purchased best sounding guitar locally ( costing $ 129 ) . After 1 day I realized I unhappy still took chance purchased guitar online . The many reviews absolutely correct . THIS guitar wonderful sounds great . I replaced strings yet original strings good LIGHT strings I bought . Even though $ guitar , I treasure one $ 300 . Perfect intonation way octave . Low action stays tune days ! pleased sound quality..sorta disappointed ... ya get ya pay ... .so 'll keep anyway I bought I could learn little bit guitar . It sounds good looks really nice . I get compliments . I learned experience first pick guitar , bad idea practice cheap instrument . Cheap $ 50-100 instruments play accurately , would likely give . This , hand , NOT low-quality instrument . Takamine makes many excellent instruments , included . It plays loud clear , zero buzzing . If looking practice guitar either someone else , look . I guarantee find guitar magnificent affordable price . Note : package include gig back case , So I bought one , fits guitar perfectly : Musician 's Gear Deluxe Dreadnought Case Black ( Black ) Yeah , strings came terrible , 's amazing guitar . I 'll admit I bought cheap I could practice playing worry becoming damaged , sounds great plays really well . I like wood finish n't slick , nice natural feel . This great guitar money . I paid $ guitar bought Amazon.com Audio Video . It arrived ahead schedule great shape , ready play right box ( tuning course ) . If want better guitar , need spend whole lot . The sound great easy play . Only 41 & # 34 ; long may weigh bit 6 lbs . stated description . My strings arrived fine condition action close I need . This beginner level guitar good quality price . It 's lightweight attractive basic finishes . The biggest drawback one I received required action adjusted . The bridge needed lowered slightly nut held strings way high frets . The result sore fingers . These easy fixes proper tools . Otherwise 'll pay guitar shop proper setup . Stock strings warm tone . I 've paid hundreds dollars guitars n't sound anywhere near nice natural one . And , mind , I yet even change strings ! So 're looking quality guitar price 's fair , simply n't better deal around . I beginner I played guitar non stop since I bought I honestly say I hear friends guitars use , sounds better I tune tho tune playing sounded different people Youtube I learning I used snark sn1 tuner sounds great complaints . I n't know expect given price , happy say nice guitar money . I impressed quality materials , components , construction . For example , tuning machines substantial heavily chromed ; work smoothly , firmly hold strings tune . The instrument came relatively well set right box ; action n't seem high , I could n't resist taking little bottom compensated saddle even , guitar plays even better . I might tinker point , probably comes time replace strings , I quite happy playability sound full-bodied dreadnought , rich resonant impressive . I still hardly believe possible deliver fine instrument low price , proof . I purchased 10 year old daughter . She learning play guitar classical guitar I gave wide little fingers reach . The action guitar perfect required set up..was ready go box . I almost kept knock around guitar nice . I playing 30 years really impressed quality guitar sweet , full , rich sound . If looking guitar , buy ! You disappointed ! This first guitar . I 've 5 6 years . My wife bought local `` center '' recommendation one teachers . I taught play . First good : This instrument good beginner piece . It nice full sound take steel fingers make acceptable sounds . The tone rich even simple chords sounding great . The fit finish piece amazing price . It looks great rough unfinished areas . The frets smooth finished fingerboard feels good . Tuning breeze hold tune well . Often tweak 2 practice session needed . I never go tune playing ( even stringbending ! ) As get better true beauty guitar starts shine . It amazingly playable . From simple melodies serious chord jams instrument handles ! The real compliant I ( reason 4 stars ) stock strings n't best ( IMHO ) beginner . I 'm pretty sure use heavy strings stock sure produce nice deep rich sound , WO N'T break , new fingers ! I would invest lighter set switch pretty early . The minor quibble bridge seems bit light duty tendency get string slap lower strings . All great deal even advanced players want extra guitar around jam n't feel like dragging expensive units ( like playing around campfire , outdoors ) If beginner starting great route go guitar continue give great sounds advance ! I recived guitar today ( ) perfect . After I tuned sounded great , plays well , hurt fingers like old guitar . This guitar amazing ! 
896	I 've tried pretty much every harp , played regional blues & jazz circuit 10 years . Lee Oskar harps best value.On top , Lee Oskar actually called I left question website ! I 've met ( Hohner harmonicas ) NAMM never called afternoon I could identify song I thought playing ! I carry around 10 12 harps gig , least $ set Lee Manji harps , nice phosphor bronze reeds great , would cost nearly $ - presuming could find them.I say I 've never blown reed LO , I say $ 22 new set LO reed plates beats $ 48 new Manji , least top , really Manji `` Delta '' harmonicas rename could double price.Lee Oskar harmonicas inexpensive , simple cheap repair , easy play , great tone , even easy identify since 1st & 2nd position keys printed right comb . That feature great beginners might able keep straight yet.Give shot . nice clear sound , ,and smooth , , , nice size someone small hands , got good things people wrote reviews , sense always wanted play , decided learn , ,and n't shore kind get , thanks reviews help , , glad got one came nice plastic case , cardboard box , throw order case , ( witch use ) bought Harmonica , , shore harmonica get low budget , one , wo n't regret , , around blue 's long time heard many harmonica 's , one truly sounds good , , I bought Hohner Special 20 key C harp test . This harp great harp , pretty much exact Hohner Special 20 overall quality . `` Feels '' little airtight , brighter louder , side-by-side testing effect Hohner Special 20 seems little extra ... expression . More life something.Both harps bendable , etc . Real high quality.As replaceable reed plates ... Amazon harp marked $ 25 level . Reed plate replacements $ 19 . Now I realize retail 's half price harp , $ 6 less `` whole new harp '' mind , I would generally recommend beginners start Hohner Special 20 . Just slightly better least fun play harp little expression available `` free '' , opinion . My son eye vintage harmonica great uncle used Europe I. Needless say , I want pass yet . I figured could start simpler . I read reviews harmonicas saw nothing positive instrument . It great tone . Its construction solid . I sure give years entertainment . This toy - great addition mouth harp collection . I 'm guitarist passion blues , matter time I going pick harmonica . I almost went cheaper options , I extremely pleased decision . It sounds gorgeous ( full clear ) , I 've already able start bending notes -- I understand I notoriously hard beginners cheap blues guitarist I tempted buy harmonica D A , played second-position , would allow play along blues songs A E ( two common blues keys ; especially among songs I like play ) . The second-position harp C G ( terribly common ) . However , I think good practice begin harmonica C , since many beginner songs C , C major scale familiar musicians . In words , I 'm exploring notes , make lot sense . At price , I wo n't mind buying D A time comes -- 's like I 'm already level I 'm dying play songs anyway . And , I need , couple songs I 've found G ( e.g. , Work Song ) . That song along keep practicing long time . If still reading review , clearly type person would love harp , add cart . 
897	I give excellent rating . They last long time , seem alter tone get `` muddy '' sound 're aging . In fact , I 'd say actually manage approach David Gilmour 's tone times ! I could barely believe , course , playing hard hours , I actually said phrase : `` Wow , sounded like David Gilmour somewhat . '' So , fact occurred without actually thinking Pink Floyd Gilmour lost playing says lot , I realized I strung guitar strings day . Get like Gilmour . I 'm hard pricing , usually , I say priced decently effectiveness . As huge Gilmour fan , brainer pick strings . Had playing DR Elixer past couple years recollection , never tried ghs . This custom gauge set plays great . They tuned right little stretching . I buy ! ! ! The strings gauge best thing strings set . , , , , , perfect balance weight confort . It fits well guitars : 1 ) Fender EVH , 2 ) . The cons come VCI , expect flakes open pack . I 'm big fan David Gilmour never fan GHS 's . So I thought I 'm wanting step one gauge 10 's try . It took little longer get stable My Strat My Les Paul sound feel Great . Now , ( I n't see first ) David 's Les Paul , He use 's 10.5 's I Bigsby Mine like His . I may try next time My Les Paul . I 'm sure work Epiphone Les Paul 'cause I Gibson BIG diference . And MIM 's Fender 's either cause mine American . All I 'm pleased DG GHS 's ... . I use Fender Strat , sound great . If appreciate talent David Gilmour , respect taste choices music , I would recommend strings . I used use Elixir strings , great Elixir sound , last long . These . I played guitar 30 years , I happy strings . 
898	Not much say basic bag . It fits dreadnaught acoustic 6 string guitar , good padding , large front pouch music small ( fairly flat ) items like tuner , winder spare strings . Has carry , shoulder straps back others . Seems well made . Just around nice case , good construction , good zipper padded enough without causing become hard maneuver . This n't one semi walled cases , normal gig bag . Works , fact I bought another classical . Nicely made well-padded guitar soft-case purchased protect Jasmine S34C NEX Acoustic Guitar . The guitar fit inside case perfectly , zippered pocket case allows storage picks , stings flat items . Very nice product . This product exactly say material , decent padding , nice front pocket , zippers function without acoustic cutaway fits nice snug.I wanted case mainly protect guitar home , works worth $ 25 . I 've using ' guitar , done fine back car , etc . It n't bulletproof , 'd pay lot airline level protection anyway . Medium padding decent sized zipper pocket , I expected price . 
899	Works expected . Clips onto pretty much mic stand . The movable head awesome . I pop filter clamped onto myOn Stage Stands MS7701 Tripod Boom Microphone pop filter double layered spaced fairly well . It provides extra layer reduce p 's , f 's , 's , etc . It also good preventing moisture spit going precious , gooseneck really make noise move . The gooseneck sturdy . It flexible yet stationary.This product exactly quality confidence ! This pop filter . It fantastic job . The plastic rings feel little cheap , need lightweight . Ultimately , great pop filter strong flexible . I would highly recommend piece , also strong habit stepping away microphone bit getting close . Works solid , looks solid , good price . I would recommend anyone ! I really like pop filter . This On Stage GB Dual Screen Pop Filter performs great makes sound professional . I particularly like flexible gooseneck , makes adjustments target.Also , filter arrived well packaged perfect order . A well deserved 5 star rating affordable product . The gooseneck holds position well adjusted place front microphone . Also , clamp works well . However , gooseneck initially made snapping sounds flexing - seems past , generally ; perhaps , 's tubing issue.I yet try pop filter microphone .
